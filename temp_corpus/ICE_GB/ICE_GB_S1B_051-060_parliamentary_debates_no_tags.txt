drawing the number he did in the ballot 
by going back in time and looking at how a particular area of human settlement is dealt with over the centuries 
And then when the Romans came they used the same area for further building 
and then throughout the Dark Ages and at the time of the Norman conquest and through medieval times 
Point of order Mr Speaker 
Could you just clarify it for me 
The other option was for them to vote for the debate to be continued 
Is it in order for a member who did not vote for the debate to be continued then to stand up to continue the debate after that vote is taken 
Yes 
What is happening is is perfectly in order 
The perhaps it would be helpful if I remind the House 
there have to be a hundred honourable members voting for the closure 
There were not a hundred members voting for the closure 
So that meant that the the closure was decided in the negative 
And it follows automatically from that that the House has decided it 's not the Chair that the House has decided that the debate should continue 
So what is happening is in order 
Mr Summerson 
Point of order 
Point of order Mr Skinner 
ought to declare their interest before they make speeches of 
Will you examine the record to see whether the member for Wanstead and Woodford and anybody else who has taken part in this debate have or have not declared their interest because there 's no doubt at all that if the state pays compensation that 's less of a market for those that are in Lloyds 
and I think it needs examining 
Order 
Point of order Mr Deputy Speaker 
Mr Rogers further to the point of order 
When the honourable member arose in his seat to to open his contribution to this debate I didn't hear him uhm Mr Deputy Speaker and I don't think that you did uh either because I don't think that he made one any declaration of his interests 
Now as I understand it under the rules of order of this House members are asked to make a declaration of their interest in the Register of Members ' Interest and then to declare it in the debate when they 're speaking 
There 's already one member of the party opposite who has been investigated as a result of being in breach of this standing order 
I I submit Mr Deputy Speaker 
He is in breach of the rules of the House and you should bring him to order 
O o order 
The House knows very well that honourable members who have an interest to declare in the debate which is proceeding should declare that interest 
And I am sure that is well known in the House 
and I am sure every honourable member will observe it 
If if any honourable gentleman feels that there has been a breach of that strong convention well then the correct procedure is to write uh on that matter to the chairman of the Select Committee on Members ' Interests 
Mr Summerson 
Mr Holt point of order 
had had enough of their members had bothered to come here today we wouldn't have had we wouldn't have had all these points of order because they would have been able to carry the closure motion 
Mist Mr Summerson 
Mr Summerson 
Mr Deputy Speaker 
in view of the 
Point of order 
I am going to speak very honestly 
What 's making me sick this afternoon is the honourable gentleman for Wanstead and Woodford who was born in nineteen fifty-two 
And that honourable gentleman was born in nineteen fifty 
fought and many died so that people like those could come into this Chamber in a free democracy 
And now and now they have taken advantage of the situation to speak out the bill of the honourable member for St Albans 
O order 
Order 
order 
Order 
Order 
Or 
Order 
Order 
Order 
Order 
Order 
The honourable gentleman is speaking from a front bench and the Chair does expect him to set a good example 
The point that he the point he 's raised is a perfectly legitimate point of debate but it is not a point of order to the Chair 
Mr Summerson 
And I see from the third paragraph of my notes here that I have put in brackets state C S 
I was coming on to the fact 
but as far as I understand the rules of the House 
as far as I understand the rules 
Point of order 
point of order 
But Mr Deputy Speaker we do call each other honourable member when we address each other in this debate 
Is it honourable for a member who 's been on his feet speaking for five minutes to quite cynically after it 's been pointed out to him that he was in breach of the rules of the House to suddenly say 
it was in my notes 
I Mr Speaker came down here especially today on the very early train to represent a constituent Cliff Clifford Hutchinson who is an honourable man a very honourable man who was on Christmas Island who now every day of his life is in pain 
And to listen to 
They are meant to 
They are designed to 
O order 
Order 
Order 
Order 
Order 
Order 
Order 
Order 
Order 
The honourable lady mustn't anticipate the next debate 
Order 
Order 
Order 
I 'm on my feet 
We are all honourable members in this House 
And every honourable member knows very well what the very strong conventions are namely that if there is an inter a direct interest in the subject under discussion well then the honourable member uh concerned declares his interest 
That is well known in the House 
Mr Summerson 
Point of order 
Point of order 
The honourable member said that he was about to announce uh he was about to make a statement referring to the initials C S 
I was talking about the history of sites of human settlement and I was saying how the same site can be used over literally 
Point of order 
Mr Corbin 
The member concerned announced he was about to come on to declare his interest and then has veered away from the subject again 
or could I ask him through you if he would now state exactly and explicitly what interest in insurance property banking or anything else he has that might have a bearing on this bill that that is going through a debate at the moment 
Order 
Mr Summerson 
a member who has to declare his interests should do it at the beginning of his speech so that members should be able to judge what he 's saying 
'nd surely if a member decided he was only going to declare his interest at the end of his speech a large part of the uh provision would be made void 
So I do hope Mr Speaker you will urge the honourable member to make the declaration of interest which himself has said he was going to make but which so far he hasn't done 
Order 
Order 
Order 
Order 
a strong impression that the honourable gentleman who has the floor is about to clarify the position 
Order 
Order 
Order 
Now I appeal to the House with the with the sense of fairness that we always have in this place 
The honourable member is about to clarify the position and I think he should be allowed to do so 
Mr Su order 
Order 
Not until the honourable gentleman has clarified his position 
Mr Summerson 
Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker 
I will most certainly bow to your ruling and I will state that I am I am a chartered surveyor and I will also state that I am the director of a property company from which I have from which I have drawn no remuneration since June nineteen eighty-seven 
Now Mr Deputy Speaker 
Point of order 
Order 
Mr 
Mr Deputy Speaker I 'm not a usual reader of Erskine May but I have studied Erskine May on this matter 
And on page three hundred and eighty-five Declaration of Interests in a Debate it says quite clearly and explicitly 
a member will normally declare his interest at the beginning of his remarks 
Order 
Order 
what is the appropriate moment for him to declare his interest 
The honourable gentleman has said he did say the word normally 
has 
order 
Order 
Order 
The ho 
Order 
The honourable gentleman is a fairly new member of this House 
We all have to order 
We all have to absorb experience 
The honourable gentlem gentleman has in fact order 
The honourable gentleman has clarified the position and I think the House should accept that and allow him to get on with his speech 
Mr Summerson 
Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker 
Order 
Now order 
The House knows that this matter may be debated on the Queen 's speech specifically tomorrow and again on uh Monday 
I think 
so I ask for single questions please 
Sir William Clark 
Would my uh right honourable friend agree that this is a very tight public expenditure settlement 
In view of the fact that although the pundits in the media and the press have been saying there 'll be an overshoot of some twelve billion pounds on public expenditure if one ignores the reserves there 's only an an s overshoot of some four and a half billion pounds 
And despite our difficulties more and more money is being spent on capital projects not like the last Labour government who reduced who reduced public expenditure on the National Health Service and on roads 
And isn't it about time the opposition stopped talking down Britain and our economy 
It is perfectly true that this is a surprisingly tight package to many commentators 
The share of expenditure the national income remains unchanged when I think many expected at this stage of the cycle that it might increase and we still expect as I indicated earlier a substantial debt repayment in the present fiscal year 
It is a tight settlement 
It was necessary to be a tight settlement 
And we will continue to keep a tight control of public expenditure 
Mr Alan Beith 
And will the Chancellor confirm that the underlying rate of inflation will remain high throughout next year that inflation minus mortgage interest relief will be high throughout next year 
Does he regard that as a serious problem 
and what is he going to do about it 
in so far to broadly to broadly the level of the headline rate 
In so far in so far as the individual programmes the honourable gentleman mentioned uh are concerned I 've already indicated to the House that something in excess of half a billion pounds is being added to the education budget largely to finance the very dramatic increase in the number of students in higher education 
And the plans imply at least as much capital spending in schools and colleges next year uh as in the current year 
On on transport the priority this year uh 
since there have been huge transport increases in each of the last two surveys the priority is the extra nearly six hundred million pounds mainly for the Jubilee Line extension the East West Crossrail and services for the Channel Tunnel 
It is a very good settlement for public transport for we are determined to produce an efficient effective public transport service 
Mr Terence Higgins 
As it 's very important for the long term trend of public expenditure to decline as a percentage of national income would my right honourable friend agree that the primary role of the rate of interest must now be to keep uh sterling within the limits of the Exchange Rate Mechanism and as a result fiscal policy has become more important than ever before 
And against the present ba economic background are not the increases in planned public expenditure he has announced entirely appropriate if we are indeed to avoid the dangers of recession 
Uh I entirely see the point that my right honourable friend has made 
Mr Sheldon 
Yes 
because when of course the underlying rate was the gr less than the R P I they made a great deal of that 
Now it 's likely to be more than the R P I can we not have his forecast of the underlying rate of inflation excluding mortgage interest at the end of next year the fourth quarter 
As the right honourable gentleman knows as a very distinguished former Treasury Minister the underlying rate of inflation has never been published for perfectly understandable reasons 
If his forecasts this year go even slightly astray just how disinflationary will two hundred billion pounds of spending be 
We do in fact have a surplus on invisibles this year 
And I would expect there to be a surplus on invisibles next year 
So I think the underlying premise of my honourable friend 's uh question is perhaps inaccurate 
Mr Radice 
Uh does 
does the Chancellor of the Exchequer agree that as the planned uh spending total to a large extent reflects the Government 's failure to control inflation and the mess over the poll tax there will in fact be little room for improvements in vital public services 
will it not the the increase in the public spending total actually disturb the markets 
Well of course if the markets listened to the honourable gentleman that would undoubtedly be the case 
But I suspect what the markets will notice is that we have kept a very tight control of inflation in the circumstances that prevail 
And I think the markets will welcome the fact that we have been able to do so 
It is clearly important that we do 
Mr Stewart 
I am i grateful to my right honourable friend for his early budgetary representation that I will consider with great care 
Mr William Ross 
No 
I 'm not at this stage anticipating a a a public borrowing requirement 
As I indicated in my statement our our our medium term policy is to remain nothing worse than balanced in uh in terms of uh in in terms of public borrowing 
I hope we will keep to that fiscal balance 
We have a surplus this year against the expectations of many commentators 
Mr Tim Smith 
Mr Speaker is my right honourable friend aware that his statement today on public expenditure is most welcome because he has succeeded in containing the increase in spending below that necessary to accommodate inflation while at the same time providing substantial additional resources for priority programmes 
But doesn't the substantial increase in cash spending next year show the urgent need to continue to press down on inflation 
And will my right honourable friend continue to take a tough uh stance on both monetary and fiscal policy 
I entirely uh I entirely agree with everything said by my honourable friend and see no need to add to it 
I could not myself have expressed it as well 
is the Chancellor aware that today there has been reported a seventy per cent seventy per cent increase to one point one billion pounds for the Shell Oil Company and it is therefore reasonable to deduce that there will be comparative increases for other oil companies 
Does he not accept that the volatility of oil prices is beneficial for the oil companies but the higher prices for the buyers of oil namely the motorists and industry is disadvantageous 
That point has I believe been examined by the M M C as the honourable gentleman will know 
He 's quite right that the volatility of oil is a a damaging uncertainty in the projections that we must make in this country and that other countries must make as well 
Mr Nelson 
Uhm 
and uh will he accept congratulations as well as the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on showing a a clear matter of political judgement in the priorities they 've given to increased health spending 
I am uh grateful to my honourable friend for his kind remarks uh both to me and my right honourable friend the Chief Secretary 
As my honourable friend knows I do believe my right honourable friend has produced a remarkably successful out-turn to the public expenditure round 
I do think it is uh important to sustain the expenditure on health 
and on this occasion we have managed to increase it in real terms by five per cent again 
I note the point my honourable friend makes about taxation 
But as he will know uh I must only consider that in the period between now and the budget 
Rooflessness as he calls it 
going through the roof 
My right honourable friend will be making that clear in his own statement 
Mr Budgen 
My uh honourable friend is well aware that I cannot comment on the prospects for taxation 
And I have no intention of doing so 
In so far as interest rates are concerned uh I will not cut uh interest rates until I am absolutely satisfied that it is safe and secure to do so 
Mr Salmond 
Am I correct in uh thinking that the Chancellor has assumed two thousand seven hundred million pounds for oil revenues in the current year bringing to a round total of ninety thousand million the total to which Scottish oil revenues have bankrolled this government over the last ten years 
Can the Chancellor tell the House what has happened to the additional r revenues from the North Sea due to higher oil prices running according to the brokers ' forecasts at twenty million pounds a day 
How much of that has gone to the oil companies 
and how much to the Chancellor 
I 'm sure the Chancellor will appreciate the anxiety of people in Scotland today to find out the answer to that question given the announcement of further steel closures and further abandonment of North Sea steel markets to the Japanese and the Germans 
o on standing up for the interests of the people of this country 
If that is the case does she not agree that this is not a destination to which we want to go 
Mr Speaker my right honourable friend is right 
The European Community is the only group of nations which after years of studying the problem has not tabled an initial negotiating position on agriculture in the GATT round 
The United States has tabled one 
Japan has tabled one 
The Cannes group have tabled theirs 
Canada 
Switzerland 
From the Community nothing 
And it really is a disgrace that we haven't even been able to agree on a negotiating position let alone start to negotiate with all the other groups by by between now and the end of the year 
Yes 
I agree with my uh right honourable friend that several countries in the Community are highly protectionist that the Common Agricultural Policy is a protectionist policy that we were trying to produce the protectionism uh first because it would help the third world secondly because it would mean that we do not have export subsidies and take therefore business away from other countries and thirdly because we in this country do believe in open trade 
It is serious 
It was the most serious thing that we discussed at the at the at the European Council 
and I most earnestly hope that this time agricultural ministers there 'll be no difficulty with us but the French and German agricultural ministers will accept the proposals of the commission for the negotiating position in the Uruguay round 
Mr Ashdown 
realise that that is good news for Britain 
divided her Cabinet and betrayed this country 's long-term best interests 
Mr Speaker does the Prime Minister realise that if she faced a Labour Party which was not equally divided equally muddled equally confused on this matter she would today face a motion of no confidence in her failure at this historic moment 
does 
Order 
order 
Does she realise 
Order 
so long will Britain be held back from its future that she no longer speaks for Britain she speaks for the past 
Oh dear Mr Speaker 
It seems that there must be quite a lot of late parrots in Cloud Cuckoo Land if the right honourable gentleman can come out with that stuff 
Of course if you have a parallel currency of course if you have a parallel currency and people choose to make more and more use of it it could evolve into a single currency 
but that could not be done without a decision coming back to this House and I believe to the people of this country 
the greatest expression of sovereignty 
I think that would be totally and utterly wrong in any event to agree to that now 
That is a matter for future generations and future parliaments and Parliament is supreme 
not the right honourable gentleman the member of the Liberal party 
Mr Robin Squire 
mostly when banks are called independent they are usually answerable either to Parliament as in The United States where Mr Greenspan is answerable to Congress or they have a number of politicians on their board 
I do not believe at the moment the structure that we have in this country would be served well by what my honourable friend is proposing 
I think it is far better to increase the amount of democracy rather than to go ahead and reduce it which I believe would be wrong at this time 
to the dispatch box and telling us that she 's prepared to sell working people in this country down the river by opening this country completely to free trade without any protection whatsoever 
Order 
give the emerging democracies in Europe a thousand million pounds loan to produce goods on wages of eighty pounds a month to flood into this country textiles in particular and enjoy and destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs here 
Is that what she was elected to do 
Or is she really uh not protecting this country at all but only pretending 
Well perhaps the the honourable member heard some of the comments behind me that better wrap yourself in the Union Jack than the Red Flag 
what the honourable gentleman has said is 
A totalist protectionist policy will lead to retaliation against us 
It will reduce the capability of our export industries to export and therefore our standard of living 
It would make our industries inefficient and therefore cost the housewife a great deal more than efficient industry 
I note also that he complains that goods come into this country from third world countries where wages are far lower 
but I 've heard him get up several times before and saying 
third world countries need help 
that the mark of a single currency is that all other currencies must be extinguished and not merely extinguished but that the capacity of other institutions to issue currency has to be extinguished and that in the case of the United Kingdom would involve this Parliament binding its successors in a way which we have hitherto regarded as unconstitutional 
I am grateful to my right honourable friend 
This Government has no intention of abolishing the pound sterling 
If the hard ecu evolved into much much greater use that would be a decision for future parliaments and future generations 
It would be a decision which could only be taken once and a decision which should not be appr approached in this atmosphere but only after the greatest possible consideration 
I believe both Parliament and sterling have served our country and the rest of the world very well 
I believe we are more stable and more influential with it 
I believe it is an expression of sovereignty 
This Government believes in the pound sterling 
I totally agree with the the right honourable gentleman 
There are some things in the Community for which there was majority voting when we went in and we accepted that 
There have been more things for the specific objective only of achieving the single European act 
There is an attempt now to get far more passed by majority voting 
That means that we would have laws imposed upon us even though this House more laws was flatly against them 
We expect our people to obey the law mainly because it has gone through all the legislative processes in this House 
and we should be very slow before we add to any majority competence on the part of the Community 
And would she further accept that that support is not based on the niceties of international economics but on the clear and firm belief that those who dictate fiscal policy for the United Kingdom should be fully and directly answerable to the electors of the United Kingdom 
I totally agree with my honourable friend 
What the Delors Report is proposing is that they should be answerable to no-one 
It is very ironic indeed that at a time when Eastern Europe is striving for greater democracy the Commission should be stri ex striving to extinguish democracy and put more and more power into their own hands or into the hands of non-elected bodies 
Joyce Quin 
on economic adventures to the Soviet Union 
Is it not the case that the British Government is far more reluctant to step in and give economic assistance than the countries of Germany France and Italy 
Is the Prime Minister not aware both of the political risks within the Soviet Union if we do not respond generously at this time and also of the long-term risks for British industry if other countries step in and establish the aid and trading relationships with the Soviet Union before we do 
Uh Mr Speaker the German banks the Deutsche Bank gave a very considerable loan to the Soviet Union of something like the order of of six billion Deutsch Marks 
That had all gone within a matter of weeks 
It was in fact guaranteed by the by the Federal Republic government 
It had all gone within a matter of weeks and was used to repay debts which the Soviet Union owed to German manufacturers 
That has gone 
It has if I might say so done nothing to help the economic situation in the Soviet Union 
When we got the request for help we suggested that we look not at general loans that wouldn't help a country already in difficulty but to see if we could give specific help in certain spheres such as for example with food processing with transport with oil exploration 
It is that we are looking at and also the I M F is looking to see what is necessary for the Soviet economy to do to get it out of the present difficulties 
Fortunately between the Houston economic summit and now the Soviet Union has had a windfall in the sense that the increasing price of oil has in fact m gave it a given it a very very much better balance of payments position and has therefore on a much much greater scale than we and therefore has improved its position 
We shall make up our mind when the I M F has reported 
Cranley Onslow 
My uh right honourable friend puts his finger on it absolutely 
this both agriculture and trade are two subjects where we have as national countries no competence at all 
They are all negotiated through the Community 
So they can do that 
They can even do it in the Agricultural Council by majority voting 
But the fact is that France and Germany stick together and refuse to have reductions in their subsidies 
Many of the other countries whose farmers are far poorer than those in France and Germany say 
how in the world can we agree to lower subsidies when the the coun when the Community 's two sets of richest farmers will not do so 
I hope that the compromise solution which the Commission hammered out with agricultural ministers will nevertheless go through because that is only the start of the negotiating position with other countries and not the end 
Otherwise we shall be responsible for reducing world trade 
We now come to motion number three overseas development and cooperation 
Mrs Lynda Chalker 
So be it 
Mrs Chalker 
I beg to move that the draft European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Subscription to Capital Stock Order Nineteen Ninety and the draft European Bank becon Reconstruction and Development Immunities and Privileges Order Nineteen Ninety both of which were laid before this House on the thirteenth of July be approved 
is most relevant 
And I greatly welcome the interest of the House of Commons Select Committee on European legislation which has recommended a debate at an early stage 
Mr Deputy Speaker I spoke with the chairman of this Select Committee the honourable gentleman the member for Newnham South 
I understood that it had not been possible to arrange the separate debate recommended 
and on all aspects raised by the establishment of the new bank 
The House will acknowledge the extraordinary change in central and eastern Europe 
And the free world has reacted quickly to this momentous process and must continue to do so if it is to help and influence events 
Preparatory discussions began in Paris in January this year and continued almost unbroken until the articles of agreement established establishing the bank were signed by representatives of its forty-two prospective members in Paris on the twenty-ninth of May 
I am grateful to her for giving way 
Further to that we got on with the basic organisational work which was purely organisational work 
But the approval to of the House to the two draft orders is requested tonight before the Government moves to ratify the agreement 
The agreement could not even have been considered further unless it had been signed by all the members back in May 
Equally the scrutiny aspect will need to be resolved to the satisfaction of the House 
Egypt Israel The Republic of Korea Mexico and Morocco have signed the articles too 
It is thus imperative that the process of ratification be thoroughly compete completed 
We want to exercise our vote when the first decisions are taken on bank strategy and investment proposals 
The President Designate Monsieur Athalie wants the agreement to enter into force early next year so that the bank can begin quickly to make its vital contribution to the development of eastern European economies and hence underpin the emerging free markets 
Just a moment 
This would be consistent with the leading role that this Government has taken in encouraging reform in eastern Europe and in insuring that the Community responds positively to it 
Why does my right honourable friend use the word vital 
Is that a mere puff to try and excite us about the size of it 
The need to have capital to start up is obvious and understandable 
but I cannot divert from anything my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said in this respect on the first of May in this House when she reported back from the European Council in Dublin which of course also discussed the matter as well as the European Council in Strasbourg last December 
I am most grateful 
economies 
Mr Speaker Sir I don't think if I strayed into the uh realms that the honourable gentleman tempts me into tonight I would have your support 
I will not therefore follow down that path 
But let me get on with this debate 
I 've already given way to my honourable friend the member for Wolverhampton once 
If approved the proposed Council decision will authorise Community membership of the E B R D 
The draft decision is presently before the European Parliament 
And we expect it to come to the Council in the autumn 
Under the proposal the Commission would have the right to appoint the Community 's own Governor and Director and rep would represent the Community within the E B R D alongside member states and other shareholders including the European Investment Bank 
The Community 's capital subscription will be for three hundred million ecu about two hundred and twenty-five million pounds of which the paid-in element will be ninety million ecus about sixty-five million pounds 
As host nation and a leading member of the new bank the United Kingdom would not want to delay unduly its entry into force 
I hope therefore that the House will agree after tonight 's full debate when honourable members have had the opportunity recommended by the Scrutiny Committee to look in detail at this that we should proceed 
but uh may be afterwards when the full details are known 
Order 
order 
Questions to the Secretary of State for Employment 
Question number one 
In April nineteen ninety the Health and Safety Executive embarked on a year-long recruitment campaign aimed at increasing specialist inspectors in posts across all disciplines including construction 
Eastham 
Does the minister is the minister aware that uh nineteen eighty-eight nineteen eighty-nine was the all time historical figure of five hundred and fourteen fatal accidents and these were mainly in the construction industry and it is believed that ninety per cent of these fatal accidents could be avoided 
Isn't it about time that the Department really got itself organised to avoid all these unnecessary deaths which are taking place which could be matched providing there was a real determination by the minister to do a proper recruitment policy 
Well I can agree uh with some at least of what the honourable gentleman says 
He is entirely right to draw attention to the fact that in construction it 's been estimated in the black spot construction report that some ninety per cent of fatalities were preventable some seventy per cent by management action 
I think the uh mistake which the honourable gentleman makes is in assuming that uh one can automatically cut accidents and fatalities simply by increasing the number of inspectors 
Certainly the uh requests of the Health and Safety Commission have been met uh in recent years 
Mr Tony Lloyd 
Will will the minister i in that case confirm to the House whe whether it is the the the case that the the H S C 's plan of action has been returned to the H S C by the Secretary of State 
and is this connected with the H S C 's bid for a further seven million pounds of funding 
Well 
let me tell the honourable gentleman that obviously the Health and Safety Commission needs to discuss with my right honourable and learned friend the question of their plan of work 
uh those discussions have taken place and my right honourable friend has made it clear that uh sufficient resources to be able to carry out that plan will be found from within our own resources 
And therefore the assurance which I gave the honourable gentleman 's honourable friend a moment or two ago remains true 
Mr Patrick Thompson 
Number two Sir 
Mr Speaker the work force in employment in the United Kingdom stood at twenty-five point four million in June nineteen eighty-nine and twenty-six point eight million in June nineteen eighty-nine an increase of one point four million over the period 
Patrick Thompson 
Mr Speaker is my right honourable friend aware that during a similar period of time the number of people employed in the Norwich area in the city of Norwich has increased by five thousand and this at the present time is coupled with a continuing downward trend in unemployment in Norwich particularly among women 
Does my right honourable friend agree that all this will be put at risk if the policies of the opposition were put into effect with the disastrous effect that would have on East Anglia 
I entirely agree with my honourable friend 
There can be no doubt whatever that the policies which would be pursued by the party opposite would work not only to the detriment of my honourable friend 's constituents very serious though that would be but to the detriment of the country as a whole 
Mr James Lamond 
will uh he bear in mind that within them there 's concealed sectors such as textile and clothing who 've been faced with very massive reductions in the number of employees in those sectors and in particular recently Courtaulds have been closing mills in the north-west of England 
Well 
of course those matters are taken into account by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry uh in the negotiations to which the honourable gentleman refers 
But what uh the country has increasingly learned over the last eleven years is that the key to success is to adapt to change and not simply to preserve existing patterns of employment wherever they may be 
That is the basis for the extra one and a half million jobs uh now twenty-seven million that have been created in this country uh one and a half million more than in nineteen seventy-nine 
Mr Riddick 
Mr Speaker can my right honourable friend confirm that this country ha has a higher proportion of its adult population in work than any other country in Europe 
My honourable friend 's analysis of the social action programme is entirely accurate 
There is no doubt at all that those proposals would destroy jobs and would make it infinitely more difficult for us to maintain the record of success uh which has been uh uh in place now for these uh last several years 
Clare Short 
I wonder if the Secretary of State understands 
I fancy Mr Speaker that if there were fewer people in work in this country that wouldn't be regarded with a a an entirely welcoming inac attitude by the uh by the party opposite 
Uh I uh believe that the fact that we have a record number of jobs in this country is something of which we can justly be proud 
It gives the people of our country the opportunities for employment and for earnings which they want 
Uh and uh it is shameful that the policies of the party opposite would act to the detriment of those opportunities 
Sir Peter Thurnham 
Number three Sir 
By ending abuses of trades union power such as secondary action and flying pickets which disfigured British industrial relations for so long our legislation has helped to attract massive overseas investment to this country to create record numbers of new jobs and to reduce the number of strikes to the lowest level for more than fifty years 
Fair enough 
But would my honourable friend remind the public of the dangers of repealing this legislation and going back to the anarchy of trade union bosses and their flying pickets 
Well 
my honourable friend is entirely right to draw attention to the fact that uh any conversion by the party opposite to the virtues of responsible trades unionism is extremely short-lived and skin-deep as well 
and indeed my honourable friend will bear in mind the uh comment uh of the honourable gentleman the member for Sedgefield reported in his letter in The Times yesterday where he glibly described lawful secondary action 
Maria Fyfe 
it probably have 
by the way they have stopped abolishing wages councils 
And if this is so is this because they are ashamed of their actions and might restore the wages councils that previously existed 
Well I can well understand that in a question which uh highlights the deficiency of uh deficiencies of the party opposite the honourable lady would want to talk about the wages councils 
Perhaps we can talk about that on another occasion 
The point aris the point the point the point ar of the point arising out the point arising out of this particular question is the fact that the trades union reforms which this Government have introduced have been overwhelmingly popular with the public and are seriously under threat as anyone who takes the trouble to look at Labour party policy in detail will see 
Mr Barry Porter 
Mr Porter 
number four 
Mr Speaker since June nineteen eighty-seven unemployment in the United Kingdom seasonally adjusted has fallen by about forty-four per cent and by just under one and a quarter million 
Mr Porter 
Somewhat strange that 
uh 
the Labour benchers find the undeniable fact that there are more people employed in this country than ever before is somewhat sad and the sign of an underdeveloped country 
I fail to understand that 
But perhaps Mr Speaker my right honourable friend would confirm that the more important figure is that our unemployment uh level is well below that of our European partners 
Well my honourable friend is uh absolutely right 
We have the lowest rate of unemployment in the European Community with the exception only of Luxembourg and West Germany 
There is no doubt at all that the policies which have led to our success in job creation would be substantially uh more difficult to carry out if the social actions programmes were implemented 
And I lose no opportunity to point this out to uh my colleagues within the European Community 
Doctor John Reid 
Does he recognise that if the steel industry in Scotland and Lanarkshire were to go unemployment in the Lanarkshire area would be thirty-three per cent among males would be thirteen per cent among females and twenty-five per cent overall 
If he intends to try and fiddle those figures would it not be easier for him to make representations to his colleague at the Department of Trade and Industry and ask him to get off his butt and do something to save the steel industry 
Well Mr Speaker my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland has made clear the Government 's concern about the future of the steel industry to which the honourable gentleman has referred 
But if the honourable but if the honourable gentleman will look to see what has happened elsewhere in the United Kingdom he will find that adjustments have taken place on such a scale as to as to ensure that the rate of unemployment in various parts of the United Kingdom which were most affected by closures in the steel industry are now lower even than the national average in this country which proves that it is possible to adapt to change in a highly successful and effective manner 
Maureen Hicks 
And would he not agree that the co-operation of the workers now to become multi-skilled not only makes them more flexible and viable in the work place but also adds to the career potential of those individuals 
Now would he also like to add his good wishes to two companies in my constituency who this week have received the Queen 's Award for Export and Technology namely Lucas and Yale 
Questions to the Secretary of State for Wales 
Question number one 
My right honourable friend the Secretary of State met health authority chairmen on the tenth of July and more recently at a briefing seminar in Cardiff on the nineteenth of October 
He intends to meet them again early in the new year 
Mr Powell 
I thank the uh undersecretary for that reply and I wonder whether or not during these discussions they discussed the development of phase two at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend 
In nineteen eighty-three his uh honourable friend the Minister promised me that phase two would be developed immediately on the completion of phase one 
I don't want like the summit in Europe last weekend a no no no from the Minister 
I want a positive reply because the people in my constituency two a quarter of a million people waiting for more than seven years and trying to do with half a hospital 
Isn't it about time this government fulfilled some of the promises that their Ministers have made 
Well 
I appreciate the uh strong strength of feeling of the honourable gentleman and indeed of many of his constituents on this issue 
and I also note how pleased they are with the new hospital which they do actually presently have 
Uh 
Mr Kim Howells 
Yes Mr Wyn-Griffiths 
Can I ask the Secretary of Sta the the Minister the Undersecretary to reconsider uhm his reply on the issue of the Princess of Wales hospital phase two because uh whilst the health authority have to make decisions on the capital spending programme the truth is that despite the extra money being put into the health service in Wales it has not kept pace with the rate of inflation and as a result this hospital promised in nineteen eighty-three has not yet been completed 
And I would inform the Minister that the consultants of the hospital do feel that they have been betrayed by the Welsh Office 
and wouldn't it be uh a a sign of real faith and uh in the health service for them now to declare that the extra funding will be provided so that the health authority can go ahead with this hospital 
I think the honourable gentleman i is uh underestimating the extra funding which he mentioned which has meant that the increase in real funding that is after inflation in the health service in Wales has risen by about fifty per cent under this government 
I would have thought too uh that uh the uh consultants and others uh he mentioned would also be pleased with the uh uh treatment centre and the amount that was spent on that in Bridgend in the old hospital 
Uh Barry Jones 
Mr Speaker does the uh Minister know that uh this year the waiting list in Mid Glamorgan has increased by thirty-two per cent and that since nineteen seventy-nine Mid Glamorgan has lost six hundred and seventy-nine hospital beds which must be lunacy 
And will he acknowledge that the Royal College of uh Nurses in Wales is very concerned about underfunding and about the situation regarding waiting lists when all they wish to do is to deliver their professional care to more and more people 
They are very very concerned 
May I warn the Minister that uhm the people in Wales are losing patience with his policies towards the health service 
These policies will lose him his seat and his government power 
The honourable gentleman must uh have a very cool mind when he considers that under his government the increase in uh treatment of patients of wa in patients uh was six per cent as compared to some thirty-four per cent increase in patients under ourselves 
and out-patient treatment fell by three per cent 
And in point of fact he mentions the waiting list in grid Mid Glamorgan 
I think it 's worth pointing out that in the uh to the year thirty-first of March of this year it reduced its in uh urgent in-patient waiting list by fourteen per cent reduced the number of urgent in-patients waiting one month or more reduced its out-patients waiting list by six and a half per cent or one thousand one hundred and twenty-two and reduced the number of out-patients waiting three months or more 
Mr Speaker is the Minister therefore aware of the worry amongst carers at the undermining of the principles of care in the community 
Would he accept that there is now inadequate support for carers in the community 
Would he admit that his strategy for community care is to depend on carers without providing for carers 
I 'm I 'm very disappointed the honourable gentleman has repeated this parrot cry that he doesn't trust local councils with the extra money which they 're receiving through the revenue support grant in order to carry out community care 
I would have thought that it was the uh flexibility given to councils to provide care in the best way possible that he ought to be trusting to 
In point of fact of course he ought to appreciate that this government is absolutely committed to its community care proposals a and we and we 
he knows perfectly well that a pro uh that resources are already being provided 
been reduced by thirty-seven per cent over the levels which applied in nineteen eighty-six 
unemployment on the environment and on the culture of rural Wales 
First of all uh Mr Speaker I thought the honourable gentleman 's own party supported the thirty per cent reduction 
uh it may well be there 's been a change in policy 
I think if there has he owes to the house to make that clear 
It is it is now it is now agreed that there should be such a cut 
Discussions are continuing as to how that cut should be implemented on nineteen eighty-six levels 
So far as the the uh Welsh farming industry is concerned I have constantly made it absolutely clear that a healthy agricultural sector is absolutely vital for the future economic environmental and social health of Wales 
We have taken a number of steps including the advance payments on sheep annual premium the increase in the suckler cow premium and of course the cost of beef intervention which last week was running at about six million pounds in that week 
So the government is doing what it can to assist this very difficult position 
My right honourable friend will be aware from his meetings with Pembrokeshire farmers of the serious concern that is felt in the farming industry at the present moment 
Mr Mr Speaker of course I will very carefully consider what my honourable friend has said 
I think he is right to highlight the uh very serious situation which would arise for Welsh agriculture if we were to enter a trade war and thus see many of our better export markets destroyed 
That certainly would be a catastrophe for the Welsh farmers 
and I certainly obviously am keeping very closely in touch with with these negotiations which I very much hope will be suc uh successfully concluded 
and he is of course absolutely right to say that any changes must be gradual and incremental 
Richard Livsey 
Will the Secretary of State indicate what representations he 's made to Brussels prior to the cutback at the weekend announced of only one third of the farms being included in the less favoured areas in Wales 
and indeed two thirds of those recommended by the Welsh Office were excluded 
Well gentleman will be aware that uh with the with my right honourable friend the Minister for Agriculture we had worked out what we felt to be a very reasonable bid a very reasonable bid to the European community 
I have yet to receive formal notification of their decision but I believe the bid was realistic and achievable and I very much hope it will be successful 
What I would urge him though to do is not unless the press report is incorrect start contacting in particular the French to urge support for their attitudes in agriculture because I don't think that 's going down very well in Wales 
Mr Bill Walker 
does my right honourable friend agree that the livestock sector in Wales as indeed in Scotland and other upland parts of the United Kingdom is an essential part of our strategic plans 
Order order order 
It 's the United Kingdom parliament uh 
Mr Walker 
Yes 
does my right honourable friend agree that the livestock sector in Wales and as in Scotland and other parts of upland parts of the United Kingdom is an essential part of our strategic planning so that we can supply the food and resources to meet these island 's requirements and the problems lie within Europe where they cannot reach a decision on matters that are fundamentally important 
I 'm very glad that we get uh that level of support from my honourable friend uh from a Scottish constituency 
It is vitally important that everybody realises throughout the community how important a healthy agricultural livestock sector is for the future of Wales and for the future of Scotland 
Barry Jones 
Mr Speaker will the Right Honourable gentleman admit that the small family farm is struggling desperately that financial disaster stares it in the face that he cannot expect our people to suffer in silence when deeply in debt and cut to the bone 
Mr Speaker isn't it the case that the Right Honourable gentleman has no coherent policy whatsoever 
What we want is for the right honourable gentleman to use the full weight of his office 
We are getting tired of a cosmetic approach an oversanguine approach 
There is a crisis and he must act now 
I completely uh agree with the honourable gentleman uh in the importance of this subject but I did not detect an alternative policy coming forward 
I believe when he examines these issues he will see he he will see uh that the important uh factor to bear in mind from the point of view of Welsh agriculture is that we must continue to support the family farm in Wales 
We have very efficient farmers but that is why we have so much to lose from a trade war and I was very sad that he made no expression of opinion on that important aspect 
Questions to the Secretary of State for Employment 
question number one 
Mr Dafydd Wigley 
Is the Minister aware that there are some two hundred and seventy thousand people with severe disabilities who are in open employment another hundred thousand who are looking for employment and that compares uh to only six and a half thousand that he just mentioned that are being uh offered opportunities in the sheltered placement scheme 
Uh Mr Speaker the honourable gentleman is referring to the figures that are in the Employment of Handicapped Report and they are very encouraging 
They show that very very substantial numbers of people with severe disabilities are in fact in open employment 
But of course we do need to continue to provide uh special placements for for for others 
But the honourable gentleman refers to the situation in Germany 
We are not persuaded that this is going to be the right approach but we certainly are looking at the whole range of ways of supporting people with dis disabilities in employment 
Thurnham 
encouraged by the survey showing that nearly a million people with substantial disabilities are in employment 
I think my honourable friend is absolutely right 
We think that the most effective approach to supporting people 
There 's no disagreement uh anywhere in the House 
It 's very important to help people with disabilities into employment 
The most effective way of doing that is through persuasion a and encouragement 
Two Sir 
Mr Speaker I 've discussed various matters with the T U C on a number of occasions including at the National Economic Development Council 
Well there 's no evidence that the T U C have an agreed policy on this matter 
Uh uh they certainly didn't uh make any such agreed policy plain at the recent uh meeting of Neddy to which I referred 
Mr Bruce 
I have uh indeed held a discussion with representatives of the T U C uh on the European Commission Social Action programme 
Uh 
Mr Ron Leighton 
Sir unemployment has risen for seven consecutive months 
No 
that unemployment is forty-five per cent lower than it was in nineteen eighty-six and that we have one of the lowest rates and that we have one of the very lowest rates of unemployment in the whole of the European community 
Those are matters uh which are more worthy of congratulation than the criticism uh which uh uh characterised the honourable gentleman 's question 
Mitchell 
The Exchange Rate Mechanism makes it absolutely clear that employers must keep all their costs very rigorously under control uh 
And clearly uh their labour costs are a very important component 
so it 's extremely important uh that all who are concerned with ne wage negotiations should uh think carefully about the consequences of their actions uh and think to uh the future not simply to uh what might happen in the very very short term 
Mr Roger Knapman 
Number Three Sir 
Mr Speaker my my my apologies for my my slowness in in rising to my feet 
C can I uh say to the Secretary of State that if his protestations about uhm all that the Government 's done uh are right whether unemployment 's going to go up on Thursday or down 
And if it 's going to go up as uh I think most people in this this House would believe can the Secretary of State tell us whether he really is intent on k making the three uh hundred and sixty-five million pounds ' worth of costs in in employment training and training for the long-term unemployed in the next financial year 
Mr Speaker I 've said previously that uh unemployment is likely to continue to go up over the next few months 
But uh what I 've also said is that we have been reviewing the best way of helping the unemployed back into jobs 
That is not always through employment training 
Uh we can offer uh a great deal of help in other ways 
Now Mr number three Sir 
Mr Knapman 
But can my uh right honourable and learned friend confirm that under these proposals one and three quarter million people part-time workers earning less than forty-six pounds a week will be required to pay national insurance 
My honourable friend is absolutely right 
The party opposite uh in their their blind devotion to the social action programme regardless of its consequences uh uh seem seem totally to have forgotten the uh words which they uh repeatedly utter uh in which they proclaim their devotion to the cause of the low paid 
Mr Kirkwood 
if the Secretary of State has had any feedback from uh the C B I and employers ' organisations about the the proposed E C regulations on night working restrictions 
Uh is he aware that there are some three million employees up and down the United Kingdom who presently work night hours and that the restrictions will make it very difficult for some of the traditional industries particularly in in rural areas where where night working is an essential part of their uhm re regime 
The honourable gentleman is uh absolutely right 
and uh I welcome his support uh on uh this uh issue 
Uh his party is not renowned for uh its determination to stand up to proposals which emanate from the European Commission 
Mr Batiste 
In principle my honourable friend is absolutely right 
Mr Ken Eastham 
Number five Sir 
Staffing is an operational matter for the Health and Safety Commission and Executive who are free to deploy their resources as they choose within an overall funding level agreed with my right honourable and learned friend the Secretary of State 
Martin Flannery 
uh Mr Ken Eastham 
During the past ten years there 've been such serious cuts in the Employment Medical Advisory Service when one considers that there are eight thousand uh on average occupational deaths uh due to occupational diseases 
And why is it further that uh in nineteen seventy-nine there were seventy-nine uh doctors and in March nineteen ninety there are now forty-four 
And the same can be said about nurses in the occupational service 
There were eighty-seven in nineteen seventy-nine and now in nineteen ninety March there are forty-nine 
Well the answer to the honourable gentleman Mr Speaker is that uh my department uh acknowledges the expertise and independence of uh the Health and Safety Executive and Commission 
and I hope the honourable gentleman would share that view with me 
If he does then I hope that he will he will approach the Health and Safety Executive and talk to them about why these numbers have changed because he would he would be told 
Uh he would be told that the reason is that they have appraised the use of the resources and have redeployed them in a way which they consider to be more effective in tackling the problems that the honourable gentleman has quite like rightly raised 
So I invite him to look at it in that light to acknowledge the expertise and independence of this excellent body and then to understand why they 've made the changes that they have made 
Mr David Atkinson 
There are no such plans 
I 've no reason to believe that there is any need in England for a scheme of government assistance specifically targeted on tourism projects 
Well 
I mean it 's obviously important the Government puts its case 
but I 'm sure the Secretary of State wouldn't want to mislead the House 
I mean he must know that the National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses is passionately angry about this measure feels that promises that were made to them in the past have been breached and thinks it 'll be very destructive indeed both for sick people and their businesses 
I mean that 's on the record 
That is their view 
I don't I don't think I I don't think I made any such pretence 
I sought to make a sensible or what I take to be a sensible and balanced comment uh on what my honourable friend had said 
And I would say to the honourable lady uh as I 've said to my honourable friend that I hope uh later in my speech when I 'll give some examples of what might be the effect on uh uh some representative smaller employees with a a a representative incidence of sickness and then looking at what they uh they would uh uh uh as it were gain in the reduction of the third National Insurance contributions for employers which have been specially focused on those lower earning ba earnings bands below about a hundred and seventy-five or a hundred and eighty-five pounds a week 
Uh 
Would my right honourable friend oblige 
Yes indeed 
Uh I 'm grateful to my right honourable friend 
Would he confirm that some of these representations that have been made were actually formulated before the operating statement uh earlier on 
Yes 
many of them were made before the very significant improvements that he announced in Social Security benefits and might well have a changed complexion if that were taken into account 
I think it is certainly the case that uh s uh the representations for example the ones to which the honourable lady referred from the National Federation of uh the Self-Employed were made and I put it slightly more specifically were made before they had the details of the reductions that had to take place in employers ' National Insurance contributions 
Yes 
uh well I the the representations I had seen I think these must be later ones 
The representations I had seen if I remember rightly were dated the sixth of of November 
I 'd need to check this 
And of course it wasn't until the eighth 
Is that right 
It wasn't until the eighth of November that I gave at the time of the Chancellor 's autumn statement the full details of the rerating proposals on National Insurance contributions 
And it is also worth noting that the reduction in National Insurance contributions for employers was actually rather larger uh both in percentage terms and in absolute money terms than I had indicated uh would uh uh uh would be the case at the time of the Social Security uprating statement itself 
In other words the actual proposals when I had refined the detail was somewhat more generous than those that had been signalled at the time I announced the S S P proposals 
And it may well be that there hasn't yet been a full opportunity to take into account uh to the extent that I would obviously wish the advantages for employers of the reductions that are to take place in National Insurance contributions which as I will say later in my speech uh total some two hundred and fifty million pounds 
They 're really quite a significant sum uh taken overall 
Uh 
but as I have said uh th there is no doubt that small employers uh do need to have their interests taken particularly into account in proposals of this kind 
I have sought to do that 
And it tr it is right also I think to note that very considerable strides have been made in recent years in the improved presentation uh of guidance on statutory sick-pay which has done a great deal to increase employers ' and perhaps especially small employers ' understanding of the scheme 
At first it was more selective and this is a point which may well emerge uh later in the debate 
It did tend initially to apply to white-collar rather than to manual workers 
As I think the House knows 
Uh yes indeed 
If for the Secretary of State because on this point uh when uh his right honourable friend the former Secretary of State the member for Sutton Coldfield introduced the Social Security and Housing Benefit Bill on the twenty-third of November nineteen eighty-one he said that the latest available estimate was almost ninety per cent of full-time employees were in some sort of occupational sick-pay scheme 
I think the latest estimate which he has given is ninety-one per cent through a survey that was done for this department in nineteen eighty-eight 
It is certainly the case that the coverage of occupational sick-pay schemes is very substantial and in particular that there has been a tendency uh to bring into those schemes more uh part-time workers for example and to have schemes which provide a more comprehensive coverage uh with the result that many of those groups uh who are sometimes adverted to as people who have missed out if you like in these developments uh have been increasingly brought in uh as uh I was about to indicate 
And I realise this is the point the honourable gentleman is uh is raising the research carried out for the department by an independent organisation uh I F F Research in nineteen eighty-eight uh showed that some twenty million of the workforce that is as the honourable gentleman says ninety-one per cent uh are working for employers with occupational sick-pay schemes 
And as I 've said on a number of occasions for example in the uprating may I just finish this uh this sentence before the honourable lady uh comes in again uh that does I think reflect and it 's something which in my view is right and proper that there is a growing acceptance by employers of much greater responsibility to cover short-term sickness among their employees 
I give way to the honourable lady 
I 'm gra I 'm grateful to the Secretary Of State 
We we know he chose the words in the operating statement very carefully 
Ninety-one per cent of the worf workforce wor work for employer employers who provide some occupational cover 
And that does not mean ninety per cent of the workforce are covered 
And the honourable gentleman should know most low-paid part-time short-term workers are not covered 
Nearly half workers in the private sector are not covered 
It is misleading to talk as though ninety per cent are covered 
I think the honourable lady will find that the figures are rather uh uh wider than that but it is certainly right 
And I 've no desire to I hope I always chose my words carefully 
I certainly have no desire to mislead anybody 
It is certainly the case that the position is uh that ninety-one per cent of employees work for employers with occupation sick-pay schemes 
But what I was seeking to say to the uh to the honourable gentleman is that in practice the nature of those schemes has become more comprehensive uh over the years and there are fewer people who are excluded from them than would 've been the case uh in the in the past 
That is the best assessment uh we can make 
uh 
and indeed uh it leads me 
May I just before the honourable gentle 
complete the next set of remarks in my speech 
then I 'll gladly uh give way to him 
The report also indicates that the majority of schemes eighty-three per cent in the private sector top up S S P to full basic pay and that overall nearly three quarters of all employees receive their full salary 
That 's three-quarters of all employees uh in these schemes receive their full salary when sick 
That is a very encouraging development and does very clearly demonstrate the extent to which employers have increasingly accepted responsibilities in the field of short-term sickness 
Now I give way to the honourable gentleman if he wishes to come in 
I do indeed uh uh 
This whole bill is premised uh on the view uh that uh occupational sick-pay uh is now extremely wide and is increasing 
That is the whole basis of this Bill 
Will the right honourable gentleman face up to the point that my honourable friend was making to him uh that forty-four per cent of private uh sector schemes do not have occupational sick-pay and indeed uh more than a maj more than a a a majority uh fifty-five per cent of private uh sector pay schemes with more with uh uh fifty-five per cent of private employers with less than ten employees do not have an occupational sick-pay scheme 
The ninety per cent figure he keeps talking about is totally irrelevant 
It is grossly misleading 
I I don't I don't accept that for a moment 
In the first place I think a figure as striking as ninety-one per cent uh of employees working for employers with with occupational sick-pay schemes can hardly can hard can hardly be said can hardly be said to be less than striking 
And secondly and secondly even even with many employers who do not have what could be described as an occupational sick-pay scheme they may well uh have a practice of continuing to pay people for some significant amount of time when they are sick 
So I don't think that I anything that I have said can be described as misleading 
And indeed I think if anything it is the way in which the honourable gentleman is seeking to minimise the extent to which there has been an improved acceptance by employers of their responsibility towards short-term sickness amongst employees 
Thanks then for giving way because I do believe this point is crucial 
If the Government is saying it 's going to change the whole basis of National Insurance on the basis that people have got cover or that ninety-one per cent of the people have got cover then we need to be clear about that figure because we profoundly disagree with that figure 
And I would just put him to him the one example 
If there is an occupational sick-pay scheme at the work place it may well be that the only person receiving that occupational sick-pay scheme could be the managing director 
and none of the other workers could be receiving anything at all in the way of actual benefits 
Isn't that the truth of the situation 
So it 's not the people that are covered but the work places which could imply that the people themselves are not actually covered nowhere near the rate at which he is suggesting and basing his argument 
Uh 
if the honourable gentleman can produce to me uh well I 'm I 'm tempted to say one but certainly any significant number of examples of occupational sick-pay schemes uh confined to the managing director then I might give some credence to his argument 
But I beg leave to doubt whether he could find a single such scheme uh let alone any significant number 
Uh 
would my right honourable fr friend agree that whilst we still have a disappointing number of young people over the age of sixteen staying on to further education it 's vital for the career development of young people and also the needs of our economy that we offer each and every young person who wants it a tailor-made training which truly assesses their individual needs hopefully much as there is the need of industry particularly skill shortages and most of all guarantees them a good qualification which will be welcomed in the workplace and be 
I entirely agree with my honourable friend 
The combination of new youth training and the training and enterprise councils uh offer us the best possible prospect of achieving the objectives which my honourable friend has identified 
Would the Secretary of State please try to do better this year in protecting the budget of his department than he did in last year 's autumn expenditure round when several hundred millions were lopped off of the expenditure on E T and Y T 
And in particular will he uh note that the London Borough of Newham feels cheated along with twenty os other local authorities who wanted to co-operate with the government on T B E I and has now found the cash cut back substantially 
Well 
the honourable gentleman who follows these matters closely as Chairman of the Select Committee will know that over the last uh four years funding for training has increased by sixty per cent in real terms at a time when unemployment has halved 
Mitchell 
Mr Blair 
Tony Blair 
Will he confirm that even after the recent Cabinet discussions and despite the chaos caused by the cut in the youth training budget for this year he still intends to cut next year 's budget by over a hundred and twenty million pounds 
There is no chaos as the honourable gentleman knows perfectly well 
And as I said to his honourable friend the Chairman of the Select Committee a few moments ago uh and as he knows perfectly well uh spending on training has increased over the last four years by sixty per cent in real terms at a time when unemployment has fallen by fifty per cent 
Mr Michael Stern 
Mr Stern 
I 'm most grateful to my my my honourable friend for that answer 
And could I take this opportunity of congratulating him on on his latest appointment 
That is very nice 
uhm to those that are concerned of the total number of permits to be issued under the British uhm Nationality of Hong Kong Bill 
Well I think I can give my honourable friend the assurance he seeks 
The strict conditions of the main work permit scheme will not be relaxed for Hong Kong citizens 
And of course under the main scheme work permits will continue to be issued to only to Hong Kong nationals who 're recruited by employers for employment in high level jobs for which employers are unable to fill from resident labour 
Mr Madden 
single uh Common Market that three hundred million E E C nationals could and I emphasise could seek employment in this country without the need to obtain a work permit 
And against that background does he not agree that the number of work permits issued to Hong Kong nationals pales into insignificance 
Well Mr Speaker of course uh European nat Community nationals will be able to seek jobs in this country and British nationals will be able to seek jobs in European Community countries 
Sir Geoffrey Dickins 
Is my honourable friend aware that a few years ago there were a lot of illegal work permits issued from his department 
I thank my honourable friend for that question 
Mr Peter Archer 
Mr Speaker Convention A Hundred And Eleven was adopted by the I L O in nineteen fifty-eight 
Every United Kingdom government since then has declined to ratify the Convention and the present Government has no plans to do so 
Mr Archer 
Certainly not and Convention A Hundred And Eleven has nothing to do with standards 
Is my right honourable friend aware of the growing level of concern about the difficulty faced by ex-offenders in obtaining employment 
My honourable frien friend raises uh an important uh matter uh and uh one indeed which uh does give rise to concern 
Uh 
I entirely accept his concern 
and it 's something which we are taking forward with the training and enterprise councils in a positive and realistic fashion 
Mr Speaker can I congratulate the Secretary of State on his productivity today which is uh enhanced over on previous question times 
Can I can I ask the Secretary of State simply this 
The the uhm does the Government have any difficulty with those parts of the I L O conventions on employment which allow for greater disclosure 
Well the honourable gentleman will know that reports of the kind to which he refers are compiled by H S E in reliance on the full co-operation of employers and it 's very important if that co-operation is to be uh continuing and available in the future that confidentiality should apply 
Uh that is why it 's unlikely that that particular report would be published 
But the honourable gentleman will know with the recent action taken by H S E in relation to the Channel Tunnel 
Mr Tim Boswell 
Mr Boswell 
Thanking my honourable friend for that reply and congratulating him on his translation would he confirm that that is the tenth successive year of increase in self-employment and that the figures are now some three quarters higher than they were when this Government took office 
Yes 
indeed I think my honourable friend has made the point uh better than I could because we know that the the main hope for the future in terms of the wealth creation and growth in employment is precisely the growth of the self-employed sector 
We have demonstrated as a Government that this is something that we welcome and that we encourage 
Our track record is excellent and we intend to maintain it in that way 
Clare Short 
I don't suppose the Minister 's had time yet 
but if he looks at the figures for income of the self-employed he 'll find very large numbers of them have very low incomes indeed 
Uh 
because the great strength of the self-employed sector is precisely that most of these people do not want the kind of intervention or interference or even pseudo-protection that the honourable lady suggests 
The self-employed are vigorous uh self-maintained people 
and they want simply to be allowed to get on with wealth creash uh wealth creation and job creation unencumbered by the sort of things that the honourable lady 's asked for 
Mr Butler 
Uh well 
Mr Speaker on my first day in this job uh I m welco welcome the sort of advice that my honourable friend has given 
He 's given me a broad hint as to the sor sort of directions I might look in in order better to discharge my responsibilities 
and I 'm very grateful to him 
Mr Speaker Sir the Conservative document Employment and Training for people with disabilities which was published on the twenty-ninth of June sets out various options for encouraging the employment of disabled people 
I shall be considering what action to take in the light of the comments we receive 
Well 
Mr Speaker we see very considerable difficulties in the way of uh following uh the path which uh the United States government has uh chosen 
but that is one of the uh matters on which we 've consulted in the document uh 
and I certainly wouldn't want to prejudge the results of that consultation in responding to the honourable gentleman this afternoon 
Not any longer 
I am I 'm most grateful to the honourable member 
Would he explain how of these ext the the remarks that he 's just made about little children will actually take place 
I I didn't quite understand that 
I 'm I 'm I 'm coming to this 
Yes 
I 'm coming to this 
It is not illogical therefore to view the human embryo as the kind of thing that should neither be killed in certain circumstances nor used for certain research purposes 
Would the honourable gentleman give way for one point 
Would he not agree with me that it 's totally incongruous that today we have in National Health Service hospitals and others doctors fighting to save the lives of children born at twenty-two weeks for parents who desperately need them and further along the corridor they are doing exactly the opposite for a child at twenty-six twenty-eight weeks 
Yes 
The vital decision 
The vital decisions that we reach 
Morals don't arise from individual preferences 
They 're not based on utilitarian consequences 
How we treat human life at any of its stages is of the highest moral significance 
I V F programme that we all welcome 
godparent to such a child an adorable child 
and inspired by the devotion of his mother Mrs Nora Jones for whom Dominic is all the more as she said precious 
In fact she said 
and I 'm quoting her 
A unique biological event occurs with the conjunction of egg and sperm 
I 'd have thought that everyone was agreed upon that one 
The contribution of modern genetics has shown however that the genetic code is really a fundamental organising principle 
Well she 's not alone in that view 
It was quoted often enough in the recent debate in the other place 
I 'm very grateful to my honourable friend for giving way 
and that one has to balance the theological view which he has put against the potential benefit to people who if in the absence of further embryo research would end up being disabled for the rest of their lives or other children yet unborn who would not be born because of the interfi infertility of their parents 
Two points arise 
A calculation about morality really is an incompatibility is it not 
It 's a contradiction in terms 
And again my honourable friend doesn't understand the meaning of morality 
Last week on a visit to Israel I found that the Israeli government was well aware of the dangers of her becoming militarily involved in the Gulf crisis 
Uh 
while she does of course have every right to defend herself will my honourable and learned friend urge the government of Israel to continue to show the considerable constraint which she has so far shown 
Uh Speaker we have taken every opportunity to impress upon the government of Israel the need to exercise the maximum self-restraint 
They have done so and they deserve the gratitude of this House 
Miss Dunwoody 
I can promise the honourable lady that I will not be confused or misled in any of the respects that she has mentioned or I hope in any other 
name 
is my honourable friend aware as the Right Honourable member for Ardwick said it is because the the most of the world and particularly the Arab world perceives double standards being employed by many countries towards uh occupation and illegal occupation of neighbouring territories uh that uh there is now an increasing danger of public opinion in countries like Egypt Jo uh Syria and Lebanon uh outstripping uh the aggravation uh which is uh not inherent in the attitude of those governments towards the current conflict in the Gulf 
Hear hear 
And as regards Jor and as far as Jordan is concerned will my honourable friend make Her Majesty 's Government 's position clear as follows that if either Iraq or Israel invades or uses Jordanian territory our attitude towards any such incursions would be the same as our attitude towards Iraq 's incursion into Kuwait 
Speaker our attitude towards Israeli policy in the occupied territories is wholly plain and I have taken the opportunity of stressing our policy both to the Israeli ambassador and to their deputy foreign minister 
They know well that we regard their occupation of the occupied territories as unlawful and that they should withdraw
