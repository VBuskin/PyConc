as absent from disa from work with with disabled people was 
Sorry could you start again 
OK 
Ten second 
medium speed 
Three two one 
I 'm blanking 
Can I can I can we take that again 
Excuse me I 've got to do what I did last time 
I hate this 
I 've got to get this out 
I won't be a second Richard 
I 'm just going to go berserk for a while 
in many ways as what I get out of other forms of dance 
there is a sense that nobody is left out of this group 
This this is a dance group which does not exclude people 
was I very much enjoyed the work that I was involved in 
I enjoyed the the time that I was given to to study and to explore 
that that there were two strands 
field 
It 's about being able to communicate and relate to th to to anybody that comes into that class 
That 's the challenge uhm 
towards each other 
Uhm 
that was work that we set up before we actually opened the class 
told us were right could actually be done 
I was brought to 
Let 's stop it for the moment 
Let 's stop for the moment shall we 
that 's going to be different for every able-bodied dancer 
because it 's from both sides 
coming to work with disabled people but equally for disabled people coming to work with with able-bodied 
I can really only say how it was for me when I came to work 
has has a part on each side 
with somebody who is in a wheelchair 
the group uhm o or when people hear about the group and say 
uh begin to dance with each other 
Mm 
How do they see it within each other 
help people in wheelchairs dance 
That 's the they hear about this group where people in wheelchairs are dancing and they think oh I 'd like to help those people dance 
Uhm 
that primarily they have to find a way to dance themselves 
then they can begin to dance with people in wheelchairs 
The people in the wheelchairs in the group are all very already very proficient dancers uhm 
Absolutely 
And it 's it 's it reflects a 
I 'm rambling 
Let 's just stop there 
Mm 
No 
That was good 
Speed 
currently the the class runs uhm on a subscription so that people that come to the class pay for the class uhm 
and therefore people that were coming we would expect them to pay 
the the the hall there once a week uhm which which means that the the pressures on us are slightly reduced 
more of an a well-known 
Yes 
influence and use than it 's currently having 
are still very restricted 
this new thing 
inroads has really made very few inroads into getting anybody with disabilities in studying on their dance courses 
they may be allowed into dance therapy 
an able-bodied dancer 
activities which would normally be associated with the d disabled people what more 
I 'd like to answer that in a s in a slightly different way 
uh a sp a a video of some of the work we 'd done to some of my college students who are on a dance course 
but they sp we are not sure how we could what we could do 
you know what can we do 
Shall I go first 
Yes 
asked me if I was interested and I said yes it sounded interesting 
because I teach now 
I teach dance but I don't get the chance always to be in a class 
so 
it was a lot of a lot of the leaning was going to be towards choreography and that was my particular interest 
I really didn't like technique 
interest in it 
That 's how I sort of got started in it 
Yeah for me 
Yeah 
But uhm I it 's uh more working with other people 
I haven't really taught them directly 
That 's all 
well I think I think it 's interesting because there 's limitations put on what you 're able to do and it 's finding ways around those limitations 
whereas within this particular class you there are limitations 
you can't go off at in all tangents or in e every direction 
uh you aren't capable of moving how you can get around those problems and become capable of moving 
Mm 
So it 's not necessarily uhm uhm a hindrance 
Mm 
Oh no no no well no no 
No not at all not at all 
It 's it 's fascinating 
I find it fascinating 
Uhm 
and that 's of as you were saying you become blas&eacute; about that 
Uhm 
in a way you you don't have to in other situations 
Uhm 
Uhm 
uhm to hurt someonedy somebody who has a disability because they haven't got so much control 
uh disability in order to s stop them from damaging themselves 
Uhm 
since both of you come becoming involved in this 
rather than a change in attitude 
Uhm 
Definitely 
Uhm 
rigid towards no not even thinking about including disabled people 
Oh yes sure 
Definitely 
I mean it 's 
I think there 's I think there 's a greater awareness 
uhm than there has ever been 
When 
And we very rarely at that time worked with disabled 
almost always when the company do go out the company I was with do go out they do work with disabled 
awareness of it in general much greater 
Uhm 
Uhm 
you c you 're there aren't 
you know I mean i just in terms of access 
I 'm sure 
Uhm uhm 
Uhm uhm 
Uhm uhm 
Uhm 
That 's right 
Uhm 
Uhm 
is the word 
so 
Uhm 
I think when you start working in a new class like that everybody is ignorant 
uhm uhm uhm 
Well yeah yeah 
That 's the thing anyway I mean wheth wheth 
Uhm 
Uhm 
dance group yeah 
Uhm uhm 
Uhm 
Yes 
with this group 
Yes 
Well yes certainly 
Uhm uhm 
however long it 
Well we 'll see what happens really 
It 's all I mean it 's all very exciting really 
we can only sort of work and see what happens 
it 's uhm and everybody 
uhm 
Uhm uhm 
Uhm 
Has it been a ne a new experience working with disabled people I pres 
I presume this is the first 
the disability side of it is not new for me uhm it 's just 
that you have to dance 
uhm 
sort of intellectually on the side thinking 
yourself being involved in in the group in the future 
do you want to continue into the performance 
Yeah I will 
it 's given me some direction already 
On this group 
of life really because I 've got nothing else 
is that it is a form of dance 
I it 's contact work uhm 
secondary really that 
Hol hold on 
One more thing 
one more thing 
uhm that that you 're working closely with is it Dindy 
Dindy 
Yeah 
Uhm 
Is it Dindy 
Yeah 
have some voice over f f for the work that you were doing 
yeah I wasn't doing very much I remember I wasn't there 
What sort of activities physical activities were available 
I mean I 'm not necessarily interested in doing sports 
I I enjoy watching it but 
building on muscle 
but i it 's uhm 
uhm 
to to 
OK 
important 
Is it important 
Is physiotherapy important for someone 
It 's very important very important and 
uhm 
and really you need it all through your life 
maybe do something at least once a week 
a m a machine 
Oh God 
Let 's leave that 
Yeah that 's not that 's not very interesting though 
No that 's all right we 'll we 'll 
We think we 've got the main point about that 
unclear-discussion 
How did it come about 
How did it start 
Uhm 
Who was Mike Heafy 
Oh right 
either name a building or uh some kind of memorial to him 
person uhm 
uhm in Stanmore 
a great thing to put his name to 
or is it safe 
Has it got a safe future 
Well no 
I it 's not a safe future 
how much the the government give 
we 've just completed that was raising uhm hoped to raise about ten thousand pounds 
to to make to fund running costs for each year 
which you know 
it doesn't generate its own funds 
does this the kind of work that you and Adam and the group are doing go on outside of that sort of 
I mean can it go on 
having the space there and uh 
Yes 
Absolutely 
Uhm or whatever they provide 
team of basketball players uhm 
I don't think there 's much integrated classes going on at the moment 
That 's what they 're trying to do I mean 
who want to join in 
movement for those people 
uhm 
a lot I think 
I think it was quite some of it was quite new to him 
taking away the the obstacles I think 
whatever 
and so on 
Uhm 
Uhm 
and uhm exploring a different dimension of movement 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Well I Well I think it 's 
yourself 
good t for people who are in wheelchairs to actually get out 
It 's such it 's a freedom in a way although it 's sort of a a contradictory thing to say because out of my chair I cannot move across the room 
In my chair I can get there fairly quickly 
to tip out of our chairs 
I don't think it 's that risky 
Yes 
as well 
And it 's 
I don't know 
love it 
to working each week 
wheelchair 
Uhm 
Uh uh in a in a chair 
Uhm 
I think so 
Yes 
in in my lounge I have a place where I sit if I 'm not going to get out of my chair 
It 's like my corner 
you know 
uhm everyone is sort of on a seat somewhere else 
it 's not the first contact I 've had with people 
Normally when people hug you you 're sort of hanging on the side somewhere you know 
neck craned 
and you know it 's not comfortable 
thing 
uhm I think that 's that 's good it 
not just Vicky 's uhm choreography 
uhm 
I always keep saying I wish it had start 
I 'm getting old 
There you go 
life aren't I life span of of dancing 
but uhm I don't know I 
in seeing our work 
what was your interest in the visual arts 
those people involved and engaged in in your work 
I think it 's much more than that 
in a very simp in a simple way yes but it 's more than that 
feed off each other and and I can hear voices coming out from all over the place 
Yeah 
All right 
Just an aside there 
Uhm the voices are coming over quite loud over the cans 
Can can you speak bit quieter Steve maybe 
Did you catch that 
OK 
We 're getting there 
Yeah 
Fine 
S 'alright 
Are we OK Steve 
Everything OK 
Yeah 
Carry on 
Sorry can I stop 
Shall we 
Sorry we have to stop 
That came about uh through my work as a painter as an artist 
uh uhm uh was a dancer with London Contemporary 
I 'll stop you there 
We don't need all this 
I 'll stop I 'll stop you there OK 
and and a mixture of able-bodied and disabled dancers 
How did that come about 
I mean what what is artistically your interest there 
Yeah 
both sets of people to a maximum of their physical and their creative abilities 
I also studied some Japanese movement forms 
uh focused towards dance 
uhm in areas of release and contact improvi improvisation 
So do you think that this work with disabled people uhm is is is th therapeutic work 
things like release work and it sounds like some kind of therapy that you 're doing 
I think the answer to that is no 
as a therapist 
uhm put on one side dance on another 
uh which is great 
When you say recovering the whole person it suggests that there is something lost 
I mean you know is there something incomplete 
Yeah 
Why is that necessary 
Right 
in a in a slightly longer and roundabout way 
a young man called uh Nat David Schwartz 
uh 
with a person in a wheelchair 
Yes yes 
how how do you 
our number at the moment 
We work with with about with about with ten 
And there 's a very wide range of disability 
does that is that difficult 
I mean does that present problems performing 
absolutely uh 
But that 's our our bread and butter really 
We can never make assumptions 
can't do it the same way 
And it went all right 
Because me and John said 
you know I 'm pandering to people who support it 
I mean I actually think element theory handles it better 
which John didn't take very seriously 
Mhm 
uhm 
What his what does he 
What Bruce Hayes was saying 
theory with a you know feature theory 
I mean he 's a bit odd 
What was I saying 
I wanted 
About you wanted to keep the fea uh feature geometry stuff 
Oh yeah 
uhm 
And he said oh yes I agree with you 
I mean I think that 's fine but you either have to develop it quite a lot or take it out 
Well it 's bad for feature geometry 
But this I mean they they can they can do 
all the rest of it that it can't possibly be right 
And then he worried me about what about about next week 
Yeah 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Don't let him worry you 
No no no no 
In not in a bad way really 
Because I mean I 'm going to say what I 've said before basically 
Are you going to go to all uhm the day on of the phonology lectures 
I think I ought to do that 
Yes 
I think you had 
Yeah 
I mean I don't know how much I 'll take in 
But I won't go to all of pragmatics the day before 
I 'd go to the Robins one because I mean that like kicks it off 
Do you think so 
Yes 
Yes 
it seems 
I mean I 'd go to that and I 'd go to the Palmer one if I was you 
they 're almost like the introductory lectures so I think they 're quite important for scene-setting 
Yes 
pick the thread up won't they 
Yeah 
Yeah 
that one actually worries me a little bit 
I suppose so 
Which 
The first two 
Palmer and Firth 
Yes 
Oh definitely 
Because the thing is I 'm going to be absolutely knackered 
Yeah 
You are 
uhm 
By the time and by the time it gets to my paper I mean I shall fall asleep 
I don't know how I 'll cope with anybody else 's 
Yeah 
I know 
Yeah 
No 
I think uh 
We could have dinner that evening or something or just collapse 
I think we should I think we should have a 
Well I mean don't f 
Oh yes 
That 's true 
No 
No 
Uhm 
I think isn't there or more 
There 's tea and one or two other things 
Yeah 
But we can't walk out because it 's after yours there 's another one 
Someone else 
Yeah 
Then tea which we could clear off at 
Uhm 
But uhm 
I 'll be completely uh 
anyway 
Uhm 
I might go 
When when exactly is it on 
It 's the twenty-seventh 
I think 
Yeah 
Yes 
It 's just a question and answer session 
And I just really want to go 
I you know I want to s hear it from from his point of view as well 
I might pop along then 
Yeah 
I don't know 
it depends whether my brain 's got back engaged by then 
Oh 
on the Wednesday 
and remember 
he 's going to start setting me deadlines 
Oh 
He 's away all next week 
He doesn't think he 'll even be at the talk 
Oh right 
Oh well 
I just met Xepe and Marcella and had a large ice cream 
Oh Xepe turned up did he 
really good 
Oh 
So she 's advised them to to get a good grounding before they go 
I don't know that she 's advised them but she 's put it in their minds that it 's going to be really tough 
So who 's who 's they 
Xepe and Andrew 
And they basically getting this under their belt before they go 
I think that 's very sensible 
So do I 
Yes 
Uhm they didn't give themselves a break though after the deadline 
Well but they 'll they 'll probably you know they 'll probably hit a point where 
Actually it 's not necessarily such a bad thing because the chances are that if they leave it they 'll never do it 
Well it was totally different 
Yeah 
I 'm very surprised at their commitment and pleased 
I mean it 's nice 
It 's very sensible actually 
Yeah 
who didn't have a computer background 
And it wasn't 
And it wasn't at all 
No way 
No 
And every single person without a computer background failed 
Uhm 
And I mean that 's ridiculous 
uh do something about that because that 's you that isn't P 
I mean Pete was Pete was clever 
Well I 
Yeah 
Well I think the thing is that with computers 
I don't do anything with it really 
difficult it is for you to understand anything 
you 're sunk 
But I mean to do a course in it I mean I 
uhm 
uhm 
I think 
Yeah 
And he was very intelligent and it still wasn't enough 
they would never have got back into it 
uhm 
uhm 
uhm 
Philip 's not actually doing that course you know 
I thought he was here 
What 's he doing 
M S C 
Well that 'll still be fairly tough 
He went for a job yesterday as an uhm London Tourist Board information giver 
I thought he 'd got a job with someone 
Well he had but he 's he keeps going 
Super high-flying 
Well he told me it 's this super high-flying uhm uh updating computer software stuff 
But it went off OK last night then did it 
Did you have a good turnout 
It was really pleasant 
Yeah 
We had a very good turnout 
Uh we charged a quid in the end 
Oh you did 
Because we otherwise we would 've been overdrawn and then I would 've been out of pocket 
Oh well 
Right 
Well right that 's fair enough then 
Well the thing was that the whole point was that we were going to have strawberries and cream 
I mean it 'd been left to me to organise it 
so I said right does everyone fancy strawberries and cream 
Well I think it 's a good idea 
It 's a summer theme 
Yeah 
Xepe and Sandra were going to go and get it 
And then what does Philip do 
a tub of marge 
Pre-Wimbledon 
So you didn't get the strawberries and all the rest of it or you did 
Well uhm he 'd already given Xepe to the money to get the strawbs and Pimms 
get it anyway 
And it went down really well 
Uhm 
Philip has no right not to agree 
No 
Well yeah 
And we 'd you know we put cucumber and lemon and orange in the Pimms 
Uhm 
Lots of people turned up 
It was really good 
Oh 
Neil didn't go 
No 
Uh apparently he had a lecture 
I don't know whether he was giving it or or taking it 
Oh 
I would imagine 
Or whatever 
and then we just went to the bar 
How long did you do English for 
When 
In s second 
Yeah 
But you weren't doing you weren't you weren't really doing English though were you really 
In the second year 
I was 
I was doing a unit 
Officially I was doing a unit of English 
Of what 
English 
Uh d' you mean of what kind of English 
Yes 
What do they call it 
I can't remember uhm 
Something terribly arty no doubt 
I can't remember 
We had a lecture by that guy Rene Weis over there 
he was a really nice guy 
In the common room that 's a lovely place to have it 
Sunday 
What are we going to do 
Is is the idea that we just go for a walk around Richmond Park 
Well Xepe seems to love this idea of having a picnic but I 'm not too sure about this 
Not if you 've had lunch 
Because I 'll have eaten anyway 
Well I mean part part of the reason I am eating will be so that I we don't have to have a picnic 
Yeah 
Why 
I haven't got anything like that anyway 
And Xepe 's going on about ooh I could cook an omelette or something 
What in the middle of Richmond Park 
No no no 
I mean previously cook an omelette 
Oh I see 
It 's just this 
Yeah 
Mm 
No 
Me neither 
and we might not want to do it 
Yeah 
any problems there 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Wise move 
And then we 'll probably get a vid out or something 
Oh that 'll be really good 
Like Oak 
Yes 
It 's only just come out in the cinema 
There seems to be this this misunderstanding with people that things that come out on video 
No 
No no 
No no 
I understood that it 's not out on video 
No 
I just wondered if you 'd seen it 
Yes 
I have 
And you oh you were the one who 
I was the one who 's seen it 
Oh Marcella has as well 
She thinks it 's brilliant quite frightening 
Really quite groovy 
because I 've seen it 
So we 're going to have 
Because you 've seen it 
I 'm sorry 
Well we 're going to have a we 're going to have endless discussions over what kind of film to get out aren't we 
uhm uhm sort of stereo thingummybob that you 
So you 're stuck with it aren't you 
Well it 's all set up anyway 
arty 
and Xepe likes arty films 
He he got really pissed off when we were watching Back To The Future Two 
He sort of sat in the corner 
He di he di he didn't give it a chance though 
I mean he didn't even think about it so 
No no no no no 
Not necessarily 
Not necessarily 
Yeah 
No no 
Well 
Yeah 
No 
It 's not the kind of stuff I find 
I mean I don't mind sillyish American films if they 're goodish sillyish Americanish films 
most of them thought Back To The Future Two was utterly brilliant 
I did certainly 
Oh but it was just so predictable 
Have you seen it 
I 've seen o one of a bit of one of them 
And you condemn the series having seen a bit of one of them 
No no that that no no that that bit where he goes shooting off in the car up the road and they he has to catch on to that electric bit and then that that flash of lightning comes and it knocks the thing down and it 's will will that mad professor get the thing back up in time to 
Yes 
Yes 
Have you seen the whole film though 
Well he has this stupid girl he falls in love with doesn't he or something 
No 
No it 's his Mum and she falls in love with him 
It 's all very well done 
Oh 
And the second one is excellent 
It 's very very very similar 
No 
But when he 's back in normal time with his parents there 's this girl who ogles round 
Oh she 's called Jennifer 
Yes 
Is that her 
Mm 
Mm 
He falls in love with his Mum back in time 
It 's his Mum falls in love with him 
Oh 
But he knows it 's his Mum 
Oh he knows it 's his Mum yes 
But she obviously hasn't the faintest idea 
Ah 
Oh 
No 
Because the reason 
But wouldn't she remember him 
I mean wouldn't she have a grown up son and think god he 's exactly like the bloke I fell in love with 
No no 
She hadn't had him at that point 
No 
I know 
But when she has had him 
I mean she fell in love with him the fifteen-year-old him back in time 
Yes 
Yes 
Yes 
I mean you have to completely suspend belief 
Who knows 
Who knows 
Oh you do 
Oh absolutely 
You have to susp completely suspend everything in fact 
Oh 
Yeah 
I 'm I 'm not saying it 's a it 's a completely intricate part 
Can we 
You 've seen you 've seen Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles haven't you 
I have 
We can get that out if you want 
But I d I don't think 
I don't think Xepe would 
I wouldn't mind seeing that 
No 
let 's be honest 
I 'm sure we 'll find something 
No 
Xepe would like Doon but I think we had this or Dune 
We had a big chat about this before didn't we 
Mm 
Why do you want that 
Well I don't know 
I just think he 'd like it 
Because it 's David Lynch he thinks it 's going to be really arty 
I don't know 
I don't 
Is it David Lynch 
Dune is 
Yeah 
Is it 
Ah 
But it 's completely un-David Lynch really 
Oh 
After all his weirdo crap 
I don't know 
You see Xepe 's going to be reluctant to see anything that he hasn't heard of 
I expect there 's just as much going on in Galicia 
There 's not much you can do about it 
Oh we 'll find something 
I mean a quid 
Haven't wasted much cash 
No 
That 's true 
We could come round with a bottle of something and I could bring the odd bottle of cider 
Uhm oh that 's true 
Yes 
I could probably manage to take you back to the station on some coke 
Yeah 
On coke 
Yes 
Or watch two videos 
Absolutely 
Stay in and watch two videos 
Yeah 
That 's all you 've got to do 
I 've got nothing 
I 'd quite like to go to Richmond Park because I was reading about it in this novel 
What are the names of those horse-drawn carriages 
Did they 
I don't know 
Uh hansoms and chaises and things 
Yeah 
Hansom cabs 
Yeah 
I mean uh hansom cabs were like taxis actually 
So that would be 
Didn't there used to be deer in Richmond Park 
Yeah 
There still are 
Are there 
It 's quite a huge one 
She says trying to sound really interesting for this tape 
It 's just a big park 
Yeah 
It 's very it 's very big 
I mean it 's not like a 
I mean is there much is there much on it 
Is it just green like just like a park 
I se 
Well it 's very hilly 
I mean lots of lots of little woods and stuff 
Ah 
Ah 
which is called something that I can't think of at the moment 
Yes 
and I can't remember what it 's called 
Ah 
Probably is 
Ah well 
It 's pretty hard to park there anyway 
No 
But there there there there 's lots of deers and lots of rabbits 
It 's not deers 
It 's deer 
Deer 
There are lots of deer and lots of rabbits 
I do apologise for that 
I 'm sorry 
You won't you probably won't see them though 
They tend to keep themselves to themselves and well away from the roads 
he 
Who shall remain nameless 
And he started talking to me and said uh said he 'd been to Edinburgh and I had to tell him that it was that it was Edinburgh 
Had he 
Oh dear 
And he 'd been there 
And he 'd been there 
Mm 
That was a bit sad 
What a shame 
Because you haven't got a history mate you should 've said to him 
Yeah 
Moosh 
Mm 
So 
Yes 
Anyway that is what Richmond Park is like 
Oh good 
And it 's not that far away 
But I 'll have to drive 
How far 
About three miles probably 
Oh 
It 's not out then 
Oh 
If it 's a really nice day we could walk 
or is it just too far to walk 
Yeah 
No 
You have to walk through the middle of Kingston as well 
When 's your Mum coming back 
Friday I think 
Friday very early morning 
My Dad was trying to convince me to to meet her uhm 
No thanks very much 
Be leaving about half five or something I think 
Uhm lovely idea 
But think I 'll stay in bed 
I think she should wait at the airport 
I mean instead of getting people up so early she could stick around and have breakfast for an hour or two 
Oh 
That 'd be great 
Yeah 
Father doesn't mind 
She 'd be terribly offended if we didn't come and pick her up 
Well I think it 's a bit unreasonable 
If it 's something like half past five in the morning when you could easily sit down and have you know 
By the time the luggage has come through and planes are delayed anyway you might as just might just as well say well come and meet us at eight or something and make it a bit decent for everyone 
Well I don't want to go anyway 
Mm 
really 
I 'll leave those wallflowers in as w to the last moment 
What 
So all the flowers have died on them 
Well these other ones are not coming along very well so 
The ones on the right hand side you can just cut the tops off and leave them 
They 'll come up next year then 
I 'm peeved about that giving her that window 
I was a fool 
I was wasn't growing seeds then of course 
What window 
Piece of glass 
A glazed uhm sash window 
No 
You can't blame her for that really can you 
If you gave it to her Dad 
No 
Well these damn plants have shot up in price so much over the last year or two 
Yes 
Those few begonias were a pound 
Yes 
It is the only way to grow them yourself really 
don't you 
No that that 's frame a little cold frame 
No 
I don't think so 
What 
Not in his shed even 
No no 
I brought that from Bow because I got it from the place next door when they threw all their window frames out 
I got two 
But I I can't I think I left the other one up at Bow 
Didn't want it 
What 's happened to the door we had out there 
saw the lower bit off and use that 
Still out there 
No 
It 's all frosted glass 
It 's almost opaque 
Oh 
Oh 
Well can't you buy a piece of glass somewhere 
D' you know how much glass is now 
It 's not very much 
It 's expensive 
It 's not because they bought a piece to go in their window 
Yes because because I broke that window 
I think it cost them three quid or something 
Cost a lot more now 
No 
Glass is very expensive 
I 'll tell you 
And that was fancy glass 
because that 's got glass in it hasn't it 
Wouldn't be very large but it 'd be big enough to go over a box of seeds 
Or a clip frame 
those are quite cheap 
Well I I I want something bigger than one box of seeds 
No 
That damn thing would 've done ideally well it annoys me to see it there sitting smugly growing her seeds 
Well does she use it 
Well she 's using it 
Well you can't blame her lovey 
Meany 
Well I mean 
Well at the time you weren't growing seeds so you didn't want it 
I mean you can hardly ask for it back 
I mean that 's not on is it 
I had it in that garage for nearly thirty years 
Did you really 
An awfully long time anyway 
Haven't you got any more glass out there at all 
Well I don't think so 
Only small pieces 
But that 's convenient 
water them down again just like that 
Ooh I could kick myself 
Well you can't ask for it back dear 
Don't you dare 
No 
But if he pegs out and she moves I 'll have it back 
Oh mm 
I expect she had any amount of glass panes down the bottom there 
Windows 
She got rid of a lot of glass 
Yes 
Yes 
But that 's convenient because it 's edged with wood isn't it 
Exactly 
Well don't uh glower at me 
I didn't give it to her 
Good job I didn't isn't it 
Why don't you uhm replace one of the back doors here and use the pane from that 
back door I shall do so 
Well they 're rotten now Dad so one day you 'll have to 
Well I 'm just putting that off for as long as possible 
They 'll fall out into the garden one day 
It 's a hundred and fifty pound job to replace a door 
That 's quite cheap I would 've thought 
Cor dear oh dear 
Well no it 's not cheap 
Well I 'll look out for something in the antique market that 
What you want y y I 'll tell you 
where you 'll find something is a car boot sale something like that 
No no no 
There used to be places where they sold secondhand building materials and all that sort of thing 
Yes 
There still are I 'm sure 
No 
I know where I got that one from 
w a large house was demolished on Westmoreland Hill 
Oh I thought you got it from got it from Bow uhm 
Oh yeah I know 
What tiles 
Oh I don't don't know tiles but I that 's where I found that 
Richard and I 
Richard and I uhm found some ti bits of tiles Victorian tiling 
Oh 
Oh 
You know blu white and blue stuff 
Mm 
Ugh 
It wasn't very exciting 
Ugh 
I don't want you dribbling on those 
Don't think we should 've been up there 
Probably not 
Oh I had some large picture frames with ancestors 
Precisely 
Exactly 
Couldn't bring everything 
do we 
Thank you very much 
You should keep your ancestral paintings 
They weren't paintings 
They were uh just photographs 
Daguerreotypes 
There 's no 
Just big photographs 
I don't want great big life-size photographs of relatives hanging on the wall thank you 
Any side of the family thank you from that era 
They were a large dumpy looking 
Because the same era would 've been horse copers on your mother 's side 
Yes exactly 
Who 
I mean your mother there was a large picture of your mother 's mother wasn't there in a sort of wig looking as fierce as anything 
What 
Uhm 
What 's a horse coper 
Well a horse breaker 
No 
I don't know that they all were 
I mean that was just an uncle 
Glorified gipsy 
That was one uncle that uh that was nothing to do 
Nonsense 
You 're a snob Dad 
Yes 
You 're such a snob honestly 
You 're wearing that battery out 
What 
Which is the the off switch 
It 's all right 
I 'll deal with it 
Do they all do that when you interview them 
Well I interviewed Andrew on Friday 
he was fascinated by it because he tol sold them in Boots 
Kept wanting to look at the peak flow meter or peak yeah 
Oh 
What is the time 
Can you see over there 
I can't see over the flowers 
Twenty twenty to one nearly 
Twenty five to one 
Twenty five to one 
Now let 's see 
ninth ah 
Think I 'll get that done first of all as number one priority 
Sunday 
Turn it off 
That 's enough isn't it 
How much more do you want 
No 
I need half an hour 
Oh for heaven 's sake 
Can't keep on gassing on for half an hour 
Not that much 
Always poking her damn nose in isn't she 
I haven't heard that 
Many students do not realise they can use the careers information resources of any local university or polytechnic 
Don't you think that 's so Laura 
That 's good that is 
Simon doesn't pay but Laura the student does 
Uhm well it 's not his fault is it if he hasn't uh been sent the forms 
I wouldn't pay it either 
And yet she has to put on her form you see that he she 's living with him in that address 
Doesn't get sent the forms 
Why 
thing 
I it 's a question on the form 
Yes 
Is it 
I don't remember that 
presumably 
Well I don't suppose she knows how many people are living in the whole property 
Me 
Mhm 
Well there are ten flats 
I 'd love to see some of the forms they get in 
I bet there 's a lo load of old rubbish put on these forms don't you 
Here 
Has Richard filled that form in that he 's got 
He 's been sent a tax form so 
Has he 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
So would I 
But there you are 
No 
First time he 's had one 
I 've never had one 
Who you 
Nor 've I 
pay tax or not 
Uh I don't know 
They 've got a tremendous job on if they do 
I was going to say 
I can't afford to pay it 
They sent one to my mother after she died or something 
it was sent to her home and then it was sent I mean to her own home uh and she 'd moved from there of course and was in the nursing home and they sent it there 
And then they sent it on to Keith 
But Keith lost it so we never sent it 
Yes I know 
Did I 
in the reposting 
Nothing 's ever happened about it 
I mean they surely they don't keep hold of everybody 
I don't believe it do you 
keep tracks on everybody 
supposed to be 
Yes 
It 'd look nice with a belt or something or wouldn't it 
No 
I really don't mind 
Have you 
Have you taken something off or put something on 
What about tying that scarf round the middle of it 
Or would that look funny 
Oh yes 
Oh it was only an idea Laura 
Oh yes 
I couldn't see 
I thought it was the same thing that you were wearing before 
I had a lovely gold belt once a sort of link belt once 
D' you remember 
I sold it though 
No I don't 
No 
I was programming in Pascal which really wasn't very exciting I 'm afraid 
Oh what d' you mean by programming in Pascal 
Well actually Cilla 
Well the book 's about two hundred and fifty pages long and we 're not really doing what we should be doing at the moment 
Xepe and me have had about ten minutes yeah ten minutes over the last week or something 
So we haven't really got very far which is a bit sad 
Uhm 
But why d' you have to do any before you go on the course 
Well because otherwise we 're going to be completely lost 
In which case you ought to be doing some phonetics surely 
really 
Yes 
But it might well help if you 've uhm actually done some 
Uh no I don't 
Well they 're not interested in phonology apparently which just seems very odd 
and I don't quite know how how they can how they can get away with with doing any any form of analysis without phonology 
but that 's their own problem 
Uh no they were they they do basics of phonetics and articulatory phonetics as well 
You would 've thought so 
I don't know 
No 
Uhm 
So that 's 
Yeah I I 've done extremely basic acoustics so I 'm quite happy with that really 
You didn't did you do that here 
Yeah 
I did that 
That was the horrible nine o'clock one on a Tuesday 
and Jane 
Yeah the one that Philip actually 
The one that Philip got very annoyed because I always used to do the experiments twice as quick as as him 
Oh so you actually did it this year 
So why didn't you do the exam 
I only did for the first term 
Oh you didn't do it for credit 
I did I did the sort of uh acousticky bit of it 
As soon as they got on to doing phonetics I left uh partly because it was nine o'clock in the morning and not really a very good time for me or or or my bank balance because it costs me like a a fiver more to come in for nine o'clock than it does if I come in for eleven 
So I thought sod it I can't be bothered 
Or anyone 
Mm Mm 
results 
The idea was you know we were supposed to do all these graphs and stuff 
You saw what happened 
I saw what happened 
so I plotted a few dots in thought ooh yeah that 's right that 's what it 's supposed to look like 
Mm 
No he 's not going to 
so stop worrying 
Bye see you Sunday 
Yeah 
But he 's a perfectionist 
I mean there 's a 
I 'm not saying you 're not 
but I mean uhm plus the 
Yeah 
Well not when I don't need to be 
I just do what I have to do 
No 
Plus the fact uhm 
I mean where he learnt acoustics which was at the Speech Therapy college it 's looking for a different thing  altogether 
Yeah 
But that was one reason why I never wanted to do that again actually 
Yeah I don't know 
No but it was very silly the things he used to do 
like we were all 
You just had to plot the response curves of the tape 
And they give us a couple of tapes and say 
right plot the response curves 
you know 
No 
To get an idea 
To get an idea 
So he 'd make all these points and they were all the same 
So I just made one there and joined them up and it it 's hardly any difference 
You just guessed that it was sort of a gradient that did that 
And then you were there 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Yeah 
Well I 'm surprised you didn't all make it a group effort and all go and look at all your graphs and in that way save all doing hundreds of points 
Well there 's only 
Who was doing it 
Jane Osborne was doing it uh but she didn't sort of turn up much which was a bit of a shame 
She never made it for for nine o'clocks 
She 'd uh occasionally walk in about quarter to ten uh 
she popped in to the odd the odd practical 
but she was actually taking it for credit 
and it was a whole unit 
Uhm 
So poor old little Janey 
Yeah 
And he was 
Bob 's in today 
Oh 
Oh did you go to that meeting 
I didn't 
But he went 
and there 's there 's a bit Dick 's written on the on the the minutes or whatever student action on uh what do the students think of the course in general and the B A and and what could be done to improve it 
Uhm uhm 
And so Bob drafted this questionnaire and gave it to Dick 
And Dick basically said he didn't like it because it was there were questions like were you given enough guidance and were your personal tutors good enough 
And these are of course the the sort of questions that Dick doesn't really want answered because if someone says no the guidance wasn't good enough and our personal tutors weren't good enough then Neil 's going to say to Dick 
right that 's your job 
No 
Mm Mm 
And Dick 's going to be completely stuffed 
Mm 
you know hit John Harris and people like that a lot and say 
why don't you 
Back from Barcelona I think 
Is he 
Oh Bob was going to try and find him today 
Yeah he is 
He I think he 's been around 
Mm 
This is a perfectly good conversation as far as I 'm concerned 
I don't know why you 're 
No 
It 's absolutely fine 
You seem to be taking it more more recordedly than me 
Oh no 
Hello 
I don't know whether to check whether it 's working or not 
a good one 
Practical 
Yes 
Yeah 
It 's going round 
Well it 's going round and the record button 's down 
That 's probably 
Yeah 
That 'll do 
What is it 
It 's a it 's a it 's a machine 
Uh is it a D C Six 
I don't know 
No 
It isn't is it 
How would you know what make it was 
It 's got a bloody great Sony sticker there 
Why have you got lots of experience 
What what numbers 
Oh this conversation 's getting really bad isn't it 
Why can't we just talk about linguisticky things anyway 
Yes go on then 
three-or-four-words 
Are you going to 
Oh the linguistics thing 
Monday the the computer room is all booked up 
Don't worry no no 
nothing nothing else to say 
I w I can't 
No it 's booked up with the word processing thing from half past nine till five 
So r it 's a complete waste of time me coming in 
Xepe 's coming in anyway because he 's got to do some teaching on Monday 
Oh all right 
So you 're not coming in right 
Well is he still meeting me uhm 
I think so 
Yeah he said he seemed quite quite happy to meet you 
I 'm I 'll attempt not to turn this off 
you know go and get some sandwiches or something 
Mm 
Are you going to be in on Tuesday then or just leave it till Wednesday 
I might come in on Tuesday depending if I 've got anything to do 
It is a D s it is a D six 
I thought it would be 
There you are 
D' you know how much these cost 
Yes 
I do 
You do 
Round about two hundred and fifty 
They 're not too bad 
That 's why I 'm worried 
I 'm taking it out on the street 
And I 'm a bit worried about it 
Well not the street but 
No they were they were given a fairly good write-up 
Are you recording 
Ah yeah you you 're recording in C then 
D' you normally record in C 
I 've no idea 
No 
No I know 
but if you 're doing 
I know 
I know 
But if you 're doing phonetics analysis you should never record in C so I 've been told 
No it 's not phonetics analysis though 
Yes 
Yes 
Hello 
I 'm just wondering if this is actually picking anything up 
Did she 
Where did she see me 
Uhm I don't 
I think through the cloisters or something 
And Xepe met my parents today 
Uh 
And what what did he did he charm them 
Mum said ah yes the one who doesn't sound as if he isn't English 
Sorry 
Run that past me again 
the one 
Uhm Mum said oh yes the one that 
Yeah right OK 
The one that doesn't sound as if he 's 
Yes I 've got it right 
OK 
Uhm 
So why isn't this giving a peak level reading 
You don't know that either do you 
I don't know that either 
leave it alone 
Why 
Well nothing 's going to happen to it really 
It 's only two hundred and fifty sods 
I mean who cares 
Three hundred and fifty 
No it 's not 
Two fifty 
I think somebody 's been leading you up the garden path 
when did I buy my camera about two years ago 
They 'd just released the six then 
Oops 
Yeah so 
Prod prod 
It 's very exciting as well 
I can tell you 
Yeah 
Yeah 
So I won't be in on Monday but he will 
I still don't know about this this rather dodgy idea of sticking my car in but 
Oh I 
Yes that reminds me 
Oh yes 
I 've forgotten to tell you all this 
Uhm Matt Street phoned while I was out 
He 's the guy who is supposed to have left 
And he had my papers and so that was the problem over the party 
Uhm he phoned 
Anyway he phoned back 
and he said 
look I 've got nothing to do 
I thought well no it 's not surprising really considering you 've given up your exams 
Uhm and he said can I pop over 
So I said yes here 
So he came over here and he got the cheque off me 
He said it 's fine 
and a deposit of ten quid which is in case the bar doesn't take more than fifty pounds 
Who 
Yeah 
What here 
Yeah 
And the bar for a start 
Right 
Which is unlikely let 's face it 
So I said so I said to him 
well look the thing is that it 's I can tell you now it 's highly unlikely to take more than fifty pounds 
We 're having a few bottles but that 's all 
But they 're not an alcoholic lot so you know 
More than fifty quid yeah 
And there aren't that many of them and everybody everybody 's got to buy two drinks really for us to to get fifty quid 
Yeah 
Yeah 
So he said well look if I might be really generous and waive it 
I took lots of photographs 
I don't know if they 're any good though 
But we shall see 
I 'm sure they will be 
uhm mainly chateaux and places like that 
And even interiors you know 
Uh do you remember the ones you took of Napoleon 's bedroom 
I have got a few 
Mm 
No 
No I load up with fast film 
Oh 
uhm 
natural lighting 
But most of my my internal shots are usually static 
and people out of the way 
it 's most successful on that 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Mm 
Yes 
Mm 
Yes 
Yeah 
I had quite a bit 
they 're usually very good in France 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
You can say that again and again and again 
Did you mm 
It 's only about thirty two pence a bottle out there for a litre 
Mm that 's worth saving 
and lime lemon lime and 
Someone introduced it to me the other day 
Mhm 
It 's uh this pink grapefruit thing at Sainsbury 's 
Yes that 's nice 
Just find it a bit just find it a bit just find it a bit sharp uh taste 
Well I quite like that sort of quininey taste that grapefruit has 
Slightly bitter taste you know 
I find it more refreshing than those sweety things 
That 's good but 
Yeah 
That 's a cabbage thing 
mm with frankfurters and sausages and things 
Mm that 's right 
in in the summer 
eat them 
Yes 
You ought to use them 
They 've got sell-by dates uh use-by dates on them 
Yes 
Well that 's all about three years in advance 
I don't know why but uh it 's sitting there 
I was sort of saving it for a rainy day and the rainy 
Well touch wood 
Yeah 
You were staying at this sort of 
Took them uh I think some some something like ten to fifteen years to complete it 
Mhm 
Mm 
Yeah 
Mm 
Yeah 
Because they were doing it on their own you see 
Mm 
you know to make it tone in 
stonemasons to do their bit 
They had a very 
Mm 
Mm 
Yes 
Mm 
What Cath 's and John 's 
That 's right 
Yes 
I think so 
They 've got a salt box haven't they over the near the fire you know sort of hollow beam where you keep the salt or used to keep the salt dry 
Yes 
Oh Cath was in this afternoon 
of the cottage 
Yeah yes 
One side 
Yes that 's right 
Downstairs 
Right 
sh she showed me some 
Good mm 
In France I mean 
Cooked with apple and uh potatoes 
And a very nice sauce to go with it 
Mm 
Mhm 
Mhm 
Oh yes 
Very Normandy yes 
Very good mm 
petit d&eacute;jeuner uhm 
One was pears 
That was an interesting one the pears one 
Yes 
Yes 
Not tasteless 
No it was nice 
And quince 
Mm you like quince 
Mm 
Mm 
Doug makes quince jelly sometimes doesn't he 
That 's right 
Yes 
And crabapple jelly I remember 
Yes yes yes right 
Yes 
Yeah 
Pear sounds as though it might be more flat you know tasteless as though it might need something to spike it sort of 
Maybe she did do something to it 
It certainly tasted strong enough 
Yeah 
Oh well yes yes 
Well wouldn't it be a granular texture because pears are granular aren't they syllables-or-words 
They 're not smooth like an apple 's flesh 
Mm yes yes mm 
Yes yeah 
What did you have it on 
Brioche croissant 
Yes I know 
Mm that 's right yes 
Right 
No their homemade brown bread 
Ah le pain complet oh the complete wholemeal yes 
Complete 
Yeah 
It was good 
mm sounds delicious 
Make their coffee I should say in saucepans 
Well they bring it to the boil and whip it off the stove 
Mm something like that 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Mm mm 
Mm 
Sounds lovely 
Very nicely done 
The actual uh kitchen units floor ones were all stone with doors put into them 
and made their doors and put them in 
Yes 
Oh I see 
Yeah oh I see 
But the wall will stand will it 
Mm yes 
Yes mm 
That 's quite original 
Very thick 
Yeah 
Mm last several lives one-or-two-word 
Should do 
it 's been around long enough 
Mm 
uhm drove out from there every day did you 
Volvo 
Yes 
Not I 
No 
Doug 
I I 'm only covered to drive it in emergencies out there 
Yes 
If his hip gives way 
Well yes mm 
Yes he yes he does need somebody with him to cover to drive you know 
In England 
But when it 's used abroad I go with him 
He pays an extra fiver on the insurance and it covers me for that period 
Yes 
you went all around 
I mean the card you sent 
Mm 
owned by the O family 
Mm 
Oh O with a circumflex over the top 
Oh yes 
Yes that 's 
I 've seen that yeah 
One ch&acircumflex;teau we went and looked at 
we didn't actually go inside 
We just walked round the ground 
And someone came and locked the gate after us 
It was a fourteenth or thirteenth century ch&acircumflex;teau and we just sort of wandered in 
Had a couple of marble statues 
big tower going around 
Really good 
Yeah 
Oh 
Mm 
Yes 
funny 
Mm 
I might 've known 
Yes yes 
Yes yes 
Unf unfortunately I don't have the style for that 
mm 
That 's 
Oh yeah 
Yes 
The Mount 
pancakes and so on 
Not on top no 
Two of them 
Yes 
And they they do demonstrations of pancakes as well 
We actually ate in their place 
Fish 
Oh that sounds good 
Oysters I should imagine 
Mm 
Yes 
Did you have pins to pick them out with 
Oh yeah 
circular flat round shells which were 
Clams 
Clams 
Could be clams yes 
And uh 
You know cockles eh 
No 
Remember we dug for them in Norfolk when you 
Oh yes 
And uh prawns of course 
Large prawns mind you 
Doug just had a plate of langoustines 
Mm 
Mm 
Did he 
Yes 
We had some nice crisp white wine to go with it 
Mm mm 
Very nice too 
Very good 
uh 
Well not there 
It was not pasteurised milk 
Yes 
The brie 
And the butter is superb 
distinctly smelly 
Rather nice 
highly con controlled 
Uh but I thought that one you know the brie de Meaux 's quite good isn't it 
Well it w it wasn't called Lyon 's Corner House but it was 
Chapel Street 
Well you know Chapel Street 
Yeah up at Islington 
with a 
Oh you don't know oh 
I didn't know Islington until I moved there but 
like 
uhm not the Trocadero 
brigade 
Mm 
Mm 
Well that was slightly above the average tea shop 
Oh 
I don't know I don't I mean I didn't know Islington at all until I moved there really 
Well a uh ask one of the stallholders down Chapel Street 
Not these days they won't 
Uhm I was down there the other day and I got some excellent salmon 
Uhm off a stall up the left if you 're going up 
Yes 
Oh I know 
I 've bought very good smoked salmon there too 
Mm 
Much cheaper than anybody else 
Mm that 's what I 'm talking about 
the trouble is that uh you can't actually rely on what he 's going to have always 
You know you think oh I 'll uh you know I 've got people coming 
I 'll get some salmon from the stall 
I have actually got about a pound of smoked salmon in the freezer at the moment 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm trail on down there 
and he hasn't any 
Have you been 
Why have I got such a terrible collection of letters here 
Mm 
Haven't got one 
That would explain a few things 
No Mummy 
This is too salty 
It is 
isn't it 
I would 've thought you 'd do better to put your S on the end of something like 
tomb 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
I know 
No 
No you 'd do better to put it on train or 
On what 
Or if you put it here you could give it a a W 
You 'd get thirteen doing it that way 
But but 
What did I do with my E 
Well you didn't 
You put it down 
It 's a pig 
There 's nothing wrong with my auk 
How many uh are there 
Are there a bag of letters 
No 
Not many 
Now you 've got two O six 
Well it 's a lot of difference 
Do ins 
at least you get ins and outs 
Go on 
What meaning 's ins and outs 
So you get six that way 
No 
I don't know what you 're doing 
On that 
Oh no 
No 
Well do it somewhere else 
I mean look 
there 's plenty of other places to put it 
How about here 
Uhm it 's OK 
I like it like that 
First of all you don't score so much 
and secondly you only get rid of two letters an 
seven twenty-four is eleven 
I mean you could do so much better than that if you 'd only 
Uhm 
Yeah 
No but 
all the same 
Kept hoping it would get better and it got worse 
Salty 
Don't like salty things 
Look 
I 'm not that much of a banana bread eater 
Oh I forgot 
Never mention it again 
Yes 
I mean you know if I w I know where these things are 
Do we have sana S A N A 
No 
Right 
Go and ox 
Oh a lot 
Never left off 
What 
Oh no I 've I I have been inured to that for years 
How wonderful she is you know 
How she how she talks 
You know how they uh got on the plane 
They were invited to out to the cap cap 
Yes 
Yes 
no 
She said we were 
Uh she said I don't know why we we were involved with the captain 
But she said uh that we were up we were up there 
And uh so she said well he imm he immediately uh was uhm all over her or som I don't know 
She she 's a joy to listen to 
Captain 's cabin 
On his lap 
Yeah 
achievements 
I mean 
Mm 
She 's happy 
Yes 
Well I mean you know so 
don't add up to a row of beans 
well 
I didn't expect to get that sort of reaction 
he was one of these men 
And uhm you know he it wasn't that he just had a limousine to take him to his aeroplane 
It it would be not the airport 
it would be the airfield 
You know it 'd be his private plane and all that nonsense 
busy dispatching people 
and then everybody could 
Yes exactly 
And uhm and she said and and where does it get him you know 
I mean all that and he 's he 's popped his clogs at fifty-three and he 's you know not not a particularly nice man 
on this sort of ego trip this power trip 
high jobs being wafted under her nose as as a sort of uh incentive you know 
And she said you know even vice president so what 
I i if i if it meant I only had ten years I 'd rather 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm mm 
Mm 
Oh yes 
Mm enjoying it 
Enjoying what he paid for 
Mm 
how clever all her acquaintances are and how wonderful they are in one way or another 
and I mean that 's that 's Linda 
but it is it is a bit hard to take 
but I I certainly wouldn't have minded listening to it yesterday 
I mean I haven't seen her in donkey 's years 
Life is a joke 
very much more to the point really 
Well she always struck me with the exception of Linda as being one of the really the only really kind people in the firm 
Kind as opposed to 
Uhm one of the few uhm 
Oh George was impossible 
Yes well I mean they 
Blake 's all right 
Yes but even he 's a bit odd really 
So OK that 's job one 
what are the others 
And uh uh I 'm doing a bit of teaching and uh 
Where 's that that is at 
That 's also that 's University College 
that 's just uhm coaching a couple of lasses for B M A and they 're doing some 
And uhm and at the College of Speech Sciences I 'm putting things in alphabetical order for them 
I see 
their temporary administrator 
in indexing 
Yes exactly in alphabetical order yes 
Have you given up doing your D Phil thingy 
Well for the time being 
It 's not not exactly my particular patch but it 's it 's at least intonation which is quite nice 
Will that be full-time 
but it pays what I would call a part-time wage 
and can you do your own hours 
I mean you can be there whenever you want 
yes yes so that should be all right 
That 's fine isn't it 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Well that 's all right 
you 're in good company 
I mean with you with your Oxford degree are now going to be photocopying and Sue with her degree is actually putting things in alphabetical order 
that should make you both feel a lot better 
You 're going to be photocopying 
And making tea and going out to get the sandwiches 
Yes that 's right 
no I want to go for it 
And when do they start then 
No 
Uhm how long do they go on for 
Six days 
Right 
Now you 're going out t to France the end of that time is it or a month later 
July the fifteenth 
I said I 'd 
They 're all they all break up one after the other 
July the fifteenth 
Uhm 
Pippa stays behind because she 's still teaching 
Yes 
already 
Yeah 
Mmm yes I had 
Uhm 
I was looking at those dates and they 've only got four days there 
What 
Oh quite yes 
No it 's the it 's the wrong side anyway 
Well it 's not that far away 
Yes I think it is 
Oh it is probably the other side of the road 
Uhm 
Quite a long way away 
Yeah it doesn't really count as Provence along there does it 
No and well we want 
But the thing is 
i i i i is is up presumably up behind uh St Trop Tropez 
you go across the uhm 
Well where I was 
Massi de two-or-three-French-names 
Yeah there 's a 
But there 's a there 's a plain that the train goes across 
I don't know 
I haven't really looked at the map 
Uhm 
You see it on the side of the motorway don't you 
yes 
Two o'clock in the morning 
Which specific layby are you remembering 
The one that we fell asleep two hours 
well I fell asleep for two hours 
and uh if you wouldn't 
Oh right that one 
Oh yes when you uhm 
You did 
didn't you 
Uhm 
Well I didn't hitchhike 
Uhm 
That 'll do fine 
Thank God thank God must do the same must do the same this year and get you some good story-tale tapes and maybe some more adult story-tale tapes I mean 
Has anybody done blue tapes for cars 
I mean that would really that 's an untapped market 
It 'd be very very useful 
Not with chil not with not with children in the back 
But I didn't enjoy I didn't enjoy Charlie And The Great Glass Elevator 
Is that the one 
I look at things and I think oh my God that hair even that glazed expression in the eye just the littlest things are just imposs impossible 
Mmm 
Do you not think women have evolved to a higher uhm 
In-style life form whatever you call it 
Cos now there 's an inbuilt it 's a knee jerk response in me is to think I 'm only joking 
It 's a pretty sad reflection isn't it 
I know 
Do you see what I mean 
Oh really 
Ah oh 
Yes 
I have benefitted from this 
That 's Mornington Crescent 
and this bus is going to turn just before Chalk Farm so that we need to get out 
What station 's that 
Hallmartin Street 
Oh gosh 
Back to Cambridge tomorrow 
Ah que sera 
Back back to me me little Darryl 
Of course I need a longer break from Darryl 
Well you should just stay till Sunday night 
I need a break of about a year from Darryl 
I know 
Do you 
Hmm 
D' you know what 
I have been without weighing scales for a week and a half now 
Yes 
Good Lord 
How 's that 
What 's that done for your head 
it makes me want to weigh myself so badly I nearly bought a second pair of scales today 
Yeah 
I thought Bryn had some 
Scales 
Yeah 
Where d' you think you 've seen those 
I didn't think I 'd seen them 
I thought I just I dunno I don't know 
I just thought he did 
Presumed he was a man who 
Not in the l nothing to do with him 
I just presumed that you were able to weigh yourself at Brin 's 
Well a no but I thought perhaps if I got scales I would be able to in future 
How late 's Wombles open up 
Here we go 
Oh shut up 
You 're not allowed out 
I 'm sorry 
Because if we got out there we 'd have a very very long walk indeed 
Delancy Street 
You 've only got a fright because you had a five course dinner anyway 
Yeah 
Well no 
I 've just had a succession of them 
I have eaten eaten eaten 
I have eaten my way round the Yorkshire Dales 
get on your body 
Yes they do 
But then they would do up if you 're a stone upwards probably 
No 
They wouldn't 
Uh well they would 
And that it would be enough to uhm 
I think you 'd know if you 'd put on a lot of weight 
Yes I think any of us would 
Do you 
Bryn has had to be my scales for two weeks 
He started off by patiently saying it 's just the same Kate 
I think he 's very sensible don't you 
He i he is very sensible yes 
We 're not at home to Mr Weighing Scale 
Well make sure you don't even have a cup of coffee before you set foot on it 
Well I won't because it will weigh extra won't it 
No that wasn't what I got 
Oh 
Uhm but anyway n no 
I I don't judge by hers 
Hers are sadistically higher but mine in Cambridge are 
Neutral 
Neutral 
Well yours in Cambridge have always told me the same story that mine have 
That 's very bizarre because I obviously lose three pounds every time I come to London on your scales 
Mm 
No 
She said rationally 
Mm 
You can always rely on me for good sense about uh weight 
Mine continues all right 
I had because I was on this this silly residential course and things I kept having meals with this are you vegetarian or aren't you 
and I wasn't allowed to say I was a whimsical vegetarian and fancied a vegetarian option 
You know you there are only three vegetarian dinners here 
Where are the vegetarians to give them the vegetarian dinner 
They must be fed and they must be fed with their stir fry or whatever it is 
And so I ended up uhm just eating sort of lumps of chicken and things 
But I do genuinely feel different for it 
Huh no 
Do you 
I feel sort of heavier 
God 
Gosh 
I had a really really good supper last night 
It was lovely 
and and a waiter who just the minute you took a sip out of the glass replenished it 
It was fantastic 
And then uhm a little thing in puff pastry with scampi in in a sauce 
And then I had the vegetarian option which was a wonderful spinach cheese thing with good uhm veggies 
And then I had a beautiful sorbet mince pies and coffee 
Mm mm 
Very nice 
Do you know this is all very odd 
If I knew for a fact that if you weren't knowing that you 're not going dancing tomorrow night that this would mean that a lot of people wouldn't know I could go to tomorrow night 
Mm 
Uh uhm 
At school 
We we 've got we 've got to as far as the the National Curriculum is concerned 
So we 're trying to 
We 're we we we 're sort of collecting those for a start 
It 's to do with the National Curriculum 
and all that kind of stuff 
but but more more of the thing that it 's to do with yeah 
But it 's it 's well it 's it 's to it 's in order to research what actually happens in in conversations 
Oh really 
Oh 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Yeah 
Uhm 
Yeah 
Yes 
I mean especially with uhm with doctor-patient conversations and all things like that 
But uhm did it was how can it how did it tie in with National Curriculum sort of thing 
Oh God 
uhm 
Shall I move these away 
Just uhm 
I mean 
Unless you sit somewhere else 
Uhm 
an in-service training that I did in uh January or so 
Don't know 
Yeah yeah 
So it 's it 's to do with the English component 
Oh yes the English the English language 
it 's to do with uhm well it 's to do with various things 
it 's also to do with 
How does that suit you 
Anybody else like a piece of anything that they can see on here that I haven't given them 
Peter where are you sitting 
Would you like a piece of that 
Here 
Yes please 
The the question uh the the questions that that you get with what are we going to use to speak about the language about about grammar about spoken English of course of this time 
and how we were going to do it 
really uhm 
I can't remember quite but 
Uhm 
Yes 
Uhm uhm uhm 
Is that what it 's about 
Sorry 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Saint David 's 
Here 
Yeah 
Uhm 
But uhm 
No it would only be you know just for sort of personal data I mean 
Uhm who hasn't got some gravy 
Yeah I mean uhm uhm 
Uhm 
I once uhm 
Gravy over the table 
Are you all right 
Who needs more of these 
Potatoes 
Marion why haven't I thought of this kind of thing 
About what 
Of having enough scope as a as a three-or-four-words 
I have did have ideas about putting it in a quiche 
but I obviously didn't get that far 
But it needs cooking so we can see if it turns out all right 
Just carry the tape back 
No but it 's three-or-four-words 
It seems to me that they they tend to come from 
Yes 
But I mean 
They 're they 're very upper class 
I mean some of the things that get lost in boys ' schools are are highlighted in a girls ' school 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Pit bulls and anthems 
I mean yeah 
Oh yeah I mean it 's probably cos I mean you know they don't advocate the fact of course that you 're actually dealing with at the end of the day young girls or young boys 
And they 've got different aspirations on what 's important as well 
Uhm uhm 
And different problems as well 
And different problems 
that 's right 
And parents have different expectations about boys from girls 
Oh absolutely 
Yeah yeah 
That 's the old kind of equation though 
They 're not quite so bad our bag 
but we 've still got the odd one that comes along and says 
well you know I sent my I sent my son off to boarding school 
Uhm 
Really 
Well as as you are a male in a female establishment you know 
booking 
only one 
twelve months 
Yeah 
Well they don't think like that 
Our parents don't think like that 
They think that if you pay it must by definition be better 
Yeah 
uhm 
Right 
It 's funny because much to my amusement some of them send their s send their girls off to you know local fee-paying schools who are you know not nearly as good as we are 
And they might just get results and uh 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Uhm 
There 's a difference between your your problems south of London and mine 
There 's an aspect 
Well there 's a big 
I mean your school is is very unusual isn't it 
Oh absolutely 
Yeah 
Clinging by its fingertips to England 
Uhm uhm 
Oh really 
Uhm 
Uhm quite unless it 's still going on 
No 
It 's not 
Oh 
For that sort of fencing having just got out and cut the grass would be ideal to make safe 
So that depends on how you want to do it 
Uhm 
Uhm 
That 's a bit 
We did we were we were going to introduce them in the sixth form but the governors absolute 
they they they were all very 
The local girls ' school wasn't in favour 
The local girls ' school was not in favour 
that 's perfectly true 
Oh It was a real case of moving your goalposts 
that 's not a very large majority 
And they uh uh and they 
But I but but why 
I mean the thing we 've got is getting female numbers 
Uhm uhm untranscribable-chatter 
We are we are different from boys ' schools 
I 'm not really in favour of boys ' schools taking on girls in the sixth form 
and that 's it 
It would be a very odd compromise 
Uhm yes 
Uh uhm 
Added to which of course it destroys girls ' schools 
Yes it certainly does that 
Yes cos they don't go through 
No 
But many girls ' schools don't have boys in it 
because parents the aspirations of the parents are still very different 
They still look on boys ' schools as somehow better than girls ' schools simply because they 've got boys in them 
Not very many sons would want to go 
They wouldn't 
Uhm 
than they are in girls ' schools and therefore in sending the son to a girls ' school it 's basically uhm 
Uhm 
three-or-four-words 
Yes 
are you taking it away 
Yeah i sorry 
Thank you very much 
Beg your pardon 
Your 
Well uh i i i well it 's it 's a problem 
to go 
Carry on 
That 's absolutely right because they 're in order to go 
so that the major 
Yeah 
Problem of course is that 
It 's something I thought that I was the last person to get 
Everything else has been stopped 
How about Bernard 
Murder 
Yes 
Yes uhm 
So you 've already identified lots of things that are interesting that that books are gifts that books are very nice to have about that there are hardbacks that there are children 's books that there are free books that there are many books you haven't got 
Mm 
Yeah 
I buy books all the time for work 
I thought I eaves-dropped and you said you haven't got time to read any 
I 've read the National Interim Report and highlighted it for these two and that 's that 's been the bedtime reading for the last two or three weeks 
Yes 
I 've I 've read it as well 
And I 've read it as well 
Right 
The the whole Department has read the National Curriculum 
No 
lovely 
Uh sometimes books bought deliberately for their archive value 
I mean it 's going back now a long time 
just because they were really interesting and were cheap when I got hold of them but uh one out of the six of the series that uhm a navigator that followed Cook about twenty years after 
I 'd love to see the other five 
beautiful old book 
Uhm and they 're sort of lovely objects in their own way 
All right 
Uhm 
Right 
Right 
Yes 
objects 
Yeah 
That 's right absolutely 
Yes 
I suppose important individual things that relate to the way the day runs 
or something like that 
The the first one I drew on is a forty-eight 
I must have drawn on it in about fifty-one 
It ruined it but I mean there 's a crut crayon marks on this thing 
I didn't read early and it 's always been picture books 
Yes 
Right 
Yes 
Right 
Yes 
Yes 
Right 
For the last couple of years 
He 's not wrong 
Nothing about having books at the bedside though 
I think 
You know I agree with everything 
There 's books as presents books for the children and so on 
over and over and over and over again 
Mm 
Yes 
We w 
Can you give us an example 
Well yes I mean 
Treasure Island 
Yes well 
The Wind in the Willows 
I 'm reading it Treasure Island at the moment to my son 
Stevenson 
Stevenson 
Yes I mean 
every every few years 
I come back to uh Dumas every so often and read The Count of Monte Cristo or The Three Musketeers 
Things like that 
And and every so often I come back to them and uh and of course they get dog-eared and so on 
to uh bring my uh collection back to uh some decent state 
Yes 
Right 
Yes 
Right 
Is that because you can't get new copies or you prefer to have 
well not 
Yeah 
No they come back in paperback but I like them in hardback 
The favourites 
But uh hardbacks I wouldn't lend to anyone 
Yes 
Hardback 
Right 
Is that an irritation when you have a vague feeling you 've lent a book to somebody and you can't quite figure it out 
It 's it 's not there 
If it 's if it 's a hardback 
and on occasion I have lent hardbacks and not got them back 
And and hardbacks have all got my name inside so 
Uhm 
Uhm 
I 've never borrowed a hardback 
But uh 
Not now because I can't really afford it 
or whatever 
You know 
I had a whole list of things that I wanted to buy eventually 
list 
in those days to do so you know 
Right 
Yes 
Yes 
Does buying books still have that the same pleasure 
Oh yes yeah super 
kind of there was a kind of feeling of regret 
And obviously buying books is very special 
Is that a forbidden pleasure 
Well I do but I I buy 
You mean a novel 
Yes yes 
Well uh uh uh no there 's pleasure in any sort of book isn't there 
yeah a textbook 
Yeah 
Yes 
Uhm 
Yes 
Yeah 
Uhm 
I think it 's easy to get precious about books 
I think uh uh I 'm uh 
You know I c I can quite happily cut a book up whereas some people 
I mean obviously there are some books that you can't do that to but but I would do that quite happily to a book 
But I 've actually done that in front of people and they can't cope with it at all 
They can't they can't cope with 
I 'd have trouble 
We we were recommend we were recommended to do this at university by one of the lecturers 
I don't even like these people who underline books that you get from the university library and so on 
Yes 
Yes I had great tension you know 
I lent a book to Jill Yeats 's daughter 
No I never no 
and the girl Jill came to me about two years ago a year and a half ago 
wasn't mannerism something similar to it 
humanism 
I said well I haven't got any obvious references 
what 's it all about 
And she wasn't very able to explain 
But I lent a book on painting to her 
It came back with scrawls all over it 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Oh that 's different cos that 's your book 
but I 
You know Di works in the library 
I mean the number that are abused 
Well it 's the same 
and John my husband was really upset about it 
Yeah 
Sure yeah 
Yeah 
Right 
Yeah 
Sure 
Yes 
I can un 
Yeah I 've done that 
I do it with magazines a lot quality magazines 
Yeah well I 'd be as well 
than tore one of my books 
I mean I seem I don't read books for pleasure at all 
I mean I think nineteen eighty-two was last time I read a book 
and get far more entertainment out of that 
Right 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Would you read a book of comics 
Well not really 
can't 
Mr Crabtree 
Mr Crabtree 
that 's where you and I have definitely 
No 
Yeah that 's true I 've got 
I 've got a soft spot for that 
Come on 
Can we root amongst them first 
You are welcome 
I 've got a bloody box full of them 
Uhm we uh Chris has done that and we 've done that when we 've moved or he 's moved on 
So he passed them on to somebody else 
So I mean I am in sympathy with 
I 've never been a reader you know a reader of novels 
I never read as a child 
I was a very slow re late reader 
not for pleasure as such 
always 
I 've read even The Hobbit and I 'm reading Treasure Island 
Me neither 
Uhm 
and uh so I mean 
Yeah we were only talking last night 
I was out with some friends 
uh and Fenimore Cooper The Last of the Mohicans and so on 
I struggled terribly with them in my early teens and had no success at all 
And that was the general feeling that uh sort of you 're given these books to read at school and it it can turn you off 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Yes 
Yes 
I 've done that with my own children 
and uh Pippy Long Stocking 
And I brought these books for for Sarah thinking you know she 's going to really 
And I I read them to her uh uh at home you know at bedtime 
and partic it wasn't the right thing to be reading at all to her 
And I had sort of had this you know image of of how I remembered 
I must have been quite a bit older 
But I you were saying about books being you go back to the old ones 
because all all a woman wants is a man to marry her 
It 's just wonderful 
and I 've I 've read that dozens of 
to sort of pretend it was a a new book 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Uhm 
Yes 
Yes 
Unreal world 
New experience 
Yeah 
A new book 
this morning 
He denied all knowledge of it 
Yeah 
Whose was it then 
I don't know 
Must be a Yugoslavian in the building 
Which part 's he from 
Do you know 
the other bit 
Presumably 
Presumably he 's done his national service 
Yeah he did 
Yeah 
Incredibly young 
That 's because they 're young 
Yes 
It 's the same in the Soviet Union 
there were guards there as well 
that go with us 
Mhm 
Unfriendly 
Mhm 
Why 
I don't know really 
You get a visa for four days 
You catch a train 
to catch your train on it 
And you arrive quite early in the morning and then march off this train at the border to get you know 
You have to change your money 
You have to change about eight pounds for the day 
It 's a lot of a lot of money 
But they make sure they sort of they seem to make sure that the processes take long enough for you to miss your train 
A sort of manip 
Well this was in Timisoara actually where we had to wait 
In where 
Timisoara where we had to 
to dilettante 
And sort of riots started there 
But I mean my only recollection of it is sleeping in a wood for about four or five hours 
Rather idyllic 
to the Black Sea 
But uhm it was very uh 
Whereabouts in the Black Sea 
I can't remember to be honest 
It was like a sort of 
then one night there at this incredibly crowded camp site which seemed to be like 
I don't know 
It seemed to be where everybody went for the holidays 
Getting there 
How do you know that 
Well because I 've been to the Soviet Union I suppose a good few times 
I have but I didn't know that 
to be at Odessa 
Yeah 
Mhm 
No 
I haven't been to the Black Sea but I have toured the Voronezh 
Recently 
My name is Amanda 
I come from London 
I live in London 
I live in London 
I am a secretary 
Yes 
What 's I 'm an artist 
There you are 
Oh 
What 's rabbit 
They did this on the Soviet 
They have deaf news you know 
Oh yes it does 
Can you speak any East European languages 
No not a word 
Yeah 
I 've been able to use some French in Romania which was quite useful 
Oh very useful 
several-speakers-speaking-at-once 
Yeah yeah 
They 've got to register contract contact with strangers at a lot of the police stations 
Quite sad 
Her son she was desperate to get her son out of the country so that he can get some sort of future she thought 
uhm sort of political activity in the fifties and she had restrictions on restricted restricted travel I think it was 
So she was dead keen to get her son out 
I think I mean that everybody did 
Oh she just sort of she found him really frustrating because he didn't seem bothered 
He thought he could listen to to music she got him when she was was walking when she was on on holiday 
Listen to rock music 
Well you can't get batteries in the Soviet Union 
No 
That 's right 
But as she said 
Well like I sold a cheapo ten pound Walkman and I 'm ashamed of this 
It 's the only black marketing I did for sixty quid sixty roubles really you know 
But I mean it 's because I needed to go on a trip for a week in Leningrad 
And then I noticed that some of the Soviets in Voronezh who are friendly even if they are teachers of English they 're only friendly with you because they wanted your underwear or your tapes 
my jeans 
for a night out 
Army belts 
From our army 
I mean I brought a buckle but I should have brought a belt 
Belts they sell are horrible brown leatherette 
I brought a nice brass buckle 
That 's probably why you have to uhm officially change your money like that because there 's obviously black marketing going on 
Yeah there 's lots 
It 's a bit of a hassle really 
But then I well I got used to it on the train 
Like you say people are friendly to you because they wanted a gold chain or something you were wearing 
something like that 
I mean one bloke did get married from our course 
He married a girl from the Soviet Union and she followed him 
She met him in Leningrad and she got hold of him 
He was the most odorous boy in the class 
and the romance blossomed somehow 
Foetus 
that 's a very dreadful word 
When he went over on a month 's trip to the Soviet Union 
He was at Liverpool Poly to begin with but he was far too intelligent 
Apart from that he tried to smuggle this girl back Vera you know in the train com compartment where you 're supposed to shove the luggage 
And of course Leda came up 
was with him on a Sept September trip 
And of course Leda came in and said 
And she said these two little heads were pro peeping down from the top of the carriage 
Of course he was caught but in the end he he stole his way out 
Because he was obviously an innocent you know abroad literally 
And th and he went back and married her 
Like who 
You know 
and they should all stick together 
They were in hospital for a week and I never even got a cold when I was there 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Well I was only there for a week so it wasn't as if I was going to get anything 
that 's only found there and in Wolverhampton 
It 's amoeba isn't it 
Amoebic 
Amoebic dysentery yeah 
But it did happen 
Warren Martin got it from our group and he 
You see we had a month 's study tour which is more like a holiday and then we those who were going to stay for three months flew back for one week to be debriefed and went back out again which was really crazy 
But he he was sort of ill and came to the doctor 's in in Li England 
How stupid 
Yeah 
I I 'm 
I remember going in in Leningrad on the first study tour thing which was lovely 
hotel it really lovely modern hotel overlooking the Gulf of Finland 
It was completely frozen over 
We went in this bookshop 
And I was just embarrassed you know 
And he looked at me and he went francuski 
You know French 
He went sorry sorry and then disappeared into the crowd you know 
Those are lovely aren't they 
Inga Nice Inga Irma 's 
Nice Irma 's 
Have you been there 
Irma 's 
I 've seen it 
Presumably you 've been inside 
Oh I went in today 
and some really nice uhm 
It 's probably Mortimer Street 
I don't know the name of the road because I didn't look but it 's not far from Charlotte Street 
It 's very near Astor College 
Uhm just behind you know at the back of Tottenham Court Road there 
Uhm it has some really nice it had a lovely wood letter-rack and a sort of in-tray done in wood which I fancied despite the fact I haven't got anything to put in it 
They 've got good stuff there you know and that African stuff 
Yeah I mean it 's sort of yeah and Asian stuff 
There is you know like those that cashmere rug I 've got on my wall 
Mhm 
Things like that 
Well I 'll have to go down to Irma 's and spend some money 
Yes 
I was I was clinging on to my purse when I was in there 
Yeah 
Uhm 
No I 'm just doing a project for my course over the summer 
What course 
One year computer science course 
Oh no 
This is all right 
more interesting than a lot of things people are doing 
Mhm 
Mhm 
What are other people doing 
Things I don't understand really 
In what department though 
A lot of people are doing things which are just within the Computer Science Department ideas that other lecturers have had 
And people are doing stuff in the Psychology Department 
Wolfson House in the acoustics bit 
I don't think so 
They 're not great social animals computer computer scientists 
Aren't they 
Mm 
uh certain maniacs transmit by electronic mail uhm binary encoded pornographic pictures 
Really 
But they are encoded 
garbage uhm lots of dollar signs and things 
find out what they 're of 
Yeah 
Really 
What 
Do you send electronic mail to people that you know though 
Yes and that I don't know 
Yeah excellent 
I 'm sure you would love it if that is well I mean 
I don't know if you if you if you if you like writing as much as talking 
Yeah yeah 
Yeah 
Of course it 's it 's entirely possible to waste your ent entire working day on it 
I mean no one really minds a few times 
And it 's uh you know so so that if a financial director comes in and happens to read it then you know you 're in the clear 
yeah they 're really good 
and fax them 
whereas when you call somebody up you have to go hi how are you 
and they go I 'm fine how are you what have you been doing you know 
You send pictures of you 
No I don't send pictures of me 
I send pictures I like 
Like like this friend of mine Andy 
I always send a picture of uhm Andy Warhol 
You could I suppose commission some prints of you yourself 
Uh 
You could commission prints of yourself 
Yeah but I can't afford that kind of thing 
could you afford 
I don't know 
No nothing really 
uhm 
I thought about having 
My sister and I were going to get a picture of of she and I done 
four years 
Just never got round to it 
For my mum and dad 
as pure especially good-looking like him 
Who would be who 
I suppose we 're not really like either of them 
No I mean Auden was extraordinarily ugly 
When he was young 
only when he was old because he had this skin disease 
When he was old yeah yeah 
but never never 
He always he was always fairly ugly 
He 's got a wrinkled old face 
And when he was old it got really sort of craggy 
Really 
Yeah very ugly 
Yeah he had some sort of disease undiag 
undiagnosed I I believe 
Is Bim at the Slade now or not 
Did he ever get there 
At Camberwell 
Oh Camberwell 
Uhm 
had an exhibition which I forgot to invite you to 
Really 
Yeah 
uh 
well uh I think he is really good 
I mean as a as a sort of 
Do you think he has it in him 
I don't think there 's anybody uhm 
There 's just 
There 's no one 
There 's no uhm 
Well my impression of the pictures I saw at the exhibition was that there wasn't uhm he wasn't filtered uh by an actual filter 
and 
and the quality was variable 
And there was no one standing around say saying to him you should junk this 
And and well you know 
Uhm and and 
Uh so some of it wasn't was not very good quality 
Yes 
Uhm 
Uh I c I mean uhm I can sort of read it to see because I I knew his life the personal uh signification significance of the pictures 
but I don't think uhm that anybody else would 
Do you still see Leo 
Yeah 
How 's he 
Fairly OK I think 
Really 
Uhm 
Does he live out of London 
Yeah he went to live in he went to uh Colchester 
He 's training to be uh don't know what you call it sort of the step above uh an E F L teacher 
Really 
Uh a sort of cour course director I think it is 
Is he still writing 
Well still isn't really the word 
It it stopped around uh 
I know he stopped years ago 
Yeah 
But is he writing at all 
Again 
No 
No 
So he 's not interested in it 
Oh yeah yeah he thinks of himself as a writer 
He ju just doesn't write 
Except he doesn't write 
Why doesn't he write 
I don't know 
I don't know 
I mean I think of myself as a non-smoker 
Well why doesn't why doesn't he 
Is he happier when he did than he used to be 
Happier did you say 
Uhm 
No 
Unhappy 
Why do why do you think he doesn't write then 
Does he not have the time 
I don't know 
Yeah 
Uhm 
But does he does he not just like write for himself 
Internally driven I meant 
I don't know though 
How do you mean 
Well he he and I invent lang lang languages 
Each of us have our our own languages 
well 
Well is it a re is it recognisable 
Oh it seems just like Turkish or something like that 
Uhm 
Like Turkish or something you know 
It 's like Turkish 
Well it 's not actually like Turkish but I mean 
Can somebody understand it 
Is it is it just stupid English 
Oh no no no 
It 's another language 
Yeah it 's another language 
Yeah 
Uh but his uhm his 
I thought you meant 
I thought you meant language like a language like you know you have different 
like don't you have different languages that you speak to different people 
You know well certain certain parts of it that other people wouldn't normally understand 
Oh I see 
Sort of like jargons slangs 
Sort of 
Yeah 
Yeah 
No no no no 
It 's a it 's a completely different la language 
I mean a real language 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah so 
As different from English as Turkish is 
I uhm 
his language is called Yathoyua and there 's there 's a dialect of it dialect of it that I speak or that that I write anyway called Dham Dhamyathua 
And how do you know 
How do I know what 
How do you know how to write it 
well I 've learnt it 
From him 
Yeah 
Right 
And uhm so I 've I 've written a few short texts in it like the Lord 's Prayer I 've translated 
Really 
Yes 
but we don't actually converse in it 
Uhm 
Because you can't 
I know you can't converse in yours 
You can't converse in mine 
Does he know does he know anything to do with your does he know a dialect of yours 
Well as I say you can't speak it because it hasn't actually got like a dictionary 
Oh right 
Well could you think in your language 
Oh I can think in it yeah 
Can he 
No 
Because of it 's it 's so unlike normal natural language that uhm I find it extremely difficult to explain to anybody how it works 
Uhm uhm I don't know 
I actually I thought I think you can have as much another language just just just in English 
Yeah 
I think you can have well not as much you can have 
you can have quite a different language where things mean different things just as in English 
but that 's only only part of that has changed 
I mean basically it 's the same 
and all the uhm 
I mean really the probably the most famous example of what we do is Tolkien 's invented languages 
Do you know do you know Tolkien 
Yes 
Yeah yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah I hated it 
Ah yes yes 
Well actually no I quite I don't really like Tolkien 
I I thought of bringing you a book as an apology for cancelling 
But all I could remember you liked once was Kathy Acker and Jack Kerouac 
And I thought you might your taste might have changed 
I still like Jack Kerouac 
In fact I re-read most of them quite recently because you know Ape Ape my ex-boyfriend 
Yeah 
Uhm 
in San Francisco he got really into it 
he 's bought loads of them now and I read them 
Uhm 
In fact there was that 
I remember the other day 
who was I talking to 
I must have been looking through one of my old notebooks from Cambridge or something before I was telling him about it 
There was this bloke in the in the cafe in Cambridge called the Steps really weird OK 
The cafe or the bloke 
The cafe was called Steps or the bloke 
What 
The cafe was called Steps 
The bloke was called also something like 
oh I can't remember what 
Where whereabouts was it 
just down some steps 
It was just you know the market in Cambridge it was yeah 
I don't know 
Or in the middle of town 
In the in the middle of town 
Oh right 
So books 
to you 
If you were a castaway on a desert island which eight books would you take with you 
Eight 
Which books would you take 
I 'd take Nelly Kelly or my cross-stitch book 
Yeah my cross-stitch book 
Right 
Uhm 
No good taking a cookery book is it 
That that 's serious 
That 's a what 
Yeah 
I don't know 
is it 
Which 
your cross-stitch book 
Yes 
Yeah yeah 
It well it shows the 
I 've got well between us we 've got quite a lot of them uhm showing you all the different things to do with cross-stitch 
Right 
So in that sense it 's it 's a reference book you go to when you want to know something 
Yeah you go to to it 
so it 'll show you each 
You get them in different books 
Right 
Right 
And that 's Hotel by Arthur Haley 
Right 
It 's enough not enough 
I keep watching the film over and over again 
I think it 's a really good book 
Right 
Uhm 
And do you read the book over and over again 
Well after a certain length of time yeah I would imagine because it was really one that always sticks in my mind 
Yes 
Right 
You got the film on video 
Well I 've watched it fairly recently 
It was on telly 
Right 
I I haven't actually kept it 
I think I recorded it because I probably couldn't really uh see it at that time but uh I 've gotten over it now but it it really is a good film 
Yeah 
Have you uh 
No uh I didn't see it 
No 
Well since I was about eleven I 've kept going back to it every few years 
Right 
Paperback or 
Very battered 
Yeah paperback 
Right 
And uh 
Is that your first copy 
Uh yes 
Before that I read it in I 've read it in the library in the three versions in hardback etc 
Right 
Oh yeah I 've definitely come down 
No I don't know 
Reading book 
I don't do that much reading 
You like 
You 'd like to have your cake decorating book 
Cake decorating book 
I was just going to say what are you going to decorate 
the sand 
I don't know what I 'd take 
Do you like those that 
autobiographic 
It 's quite nice for me 
It 's based around Blackburn 
Yeah 
Uhm uhm 
You 've got a lot haven't you 
Very good 
Yeah she is very good 
I like hers or a Catherine Cookson maybe 
Yeah 
Or Barbara Taylor Bradford 
Nicky Devlin 
Oh she 's OK 
No 
No 
I can't get into those 
I can't get into those 
Why would anybody take a novel 
you know a lighter 
Well I want to take my crossword 
Anyway 
Go on 
You can have two 
All right 
Uhm I don't know really 
And a thesaurus 
Yeah oh 
Why not 
nothing stands out 
Yeah 
I suppose 
No 
I can't say anything really stands out in mind 
No 
So are you reading something at the moment 
Yes 
which is so-so 
Right 
What what 's by the bedside 
A book 
Yes 
I couldn't tell you what it 's called 
But it 's only a novel 
But I like the Catherine Cookson books 
Danielle Steele 
as well 
nothing nothing too heavy 
well you don't get much chance to read except in the evening 
you know 
Right 
Right 
Right 
Danielle Steele 
Uhm 
Right 
What what would be a sort of heavy book 
To me 
Yes 
Uh oh uhm 
Well 
Yeah 
Well it sounds like Lord of the Rings 
War war war 
No 
My boss had said you must read those books 
And I never ever have 
War and Peace 
Right 
I it 's it to me the the 
I 've tried a few times 
And I 've never got 
That 's the first sentence in it 
and that 's 
Well I 've never tried 
But everybody talks about them as being so wonderful but I 've never ever read them 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I think it 's how you 're introduced to them 
Yeah 
Is it yeah 
And then I wanted more 
again The Hobbit 
I keep going back to that 
That 's 
Yes 
Yeah 
That 's right 
That 's right yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
So I don't know 
Uhm 
supposed to be very good 
But I can't get into that at all 
But I I 
I tried twice 
Yeah 
Tried twice to start reading that and couldn't get interested at all 
When do you read tend to read 
It has been said in the evenings 
in the uh bedtime 
Not 
Yes 
Yes 
That 's when I read 
Uhm 
I always have a book 
I couldn't I couldn't sleep if I didn't read 
sit down during the day 
And I read hers 
When we 're on holiday 
Right 
I mean it 's fabulous to get hold of a book and you just don't want to put it down 
It 's it 's wonderful isn't it when you just want uh it to go on and on forever and never finish 
Yes yeah 
I mean I know it 
I share your view but I just wonder why you think that 's good 
that uh gets you so involved 
Yeah 
Well 
Well I don't know 
It must be 
You don't you don't want it to finish 
Because the story is so good and it 's so well written and uhm you get really into it and you 're very sad when it 's finished 
Uhm 
So is that that the bit that that you 're involved in it 
You take uhm 
Yeah 
I actually actually think so 
Yes 
Yes because I don't like I don't like historical books 
very old in the olden times 
They don't do anything for me at all 
well this century anyway 
Uh nothing too complicated and too old 
uh not going so far back 
Yes yeah 
Uhm 
Yes right 
Well there 's some of hers that are 
I can't 
I don't like her lords and her lady books at all 
No but if I 'm read reading 
And yet she writes some wonderful other books that I like 
Yeah that 's right 
Yeah 
Yes they are 
And yet uh I know everybody laughs about Barbara Cartland but they 're fabulous to read 
innocent 
And it 's so you kn know honestly the they 
Yeah uhm 
Yeah 
They are 
So easy to read you know I mean and now they hers are all lords and ladies and all 
But there 's just something about them that 's so 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Yeah 
I like to read 
Uh I like to a book to be real 
Oh yes they are 
As it was 
Yeah 
Yes 
in your imagination 
Yeah you still imagine what it was like 
But I like the book t to give me all the information 
With real people 
No 
Yes 
The facts 
that 's right 
Yes 
To tell you 
Which Catherine Cookson does 
Yeah she does yeah 
Mind you I think I think Danielle Steele does in a modern 
Yeah yeah in a modern way 
They 're situations that could happen to anybody 
And those and those Christian Marion Fraser 
have you read them 
No 
No 
No 
Haven't heard of her 
Blue Above the Chimney and Roses Around the Door 
Yeah they 're 
But y you still need the book to escape don't you 
I mean that that 's 
Oh yes 
Yeah 
I mean y you 're escaping into the book in uh you know everything around you 
but it 's yeah becomes 
Yeah 
Becomes all important 
Yeah well not when your tea 's burning 
No 
I 'll just finish this book 
Sorry 
I 'm just stood there watching the potatoes boil over 
and I 'm thinking 
shouldn't be doing this 
when you come home at night and she 's still in her dressing gown with a cold cup of coffee and a piece of toast it 's 
I know you said you didn't read 
Well no 
No I don't 
I told you I only read textbooks 
That 's all uh 
reference books if you like 
Percy Thrower I think I would take 
How to Survive on a Desert Island 
because once you 've read it you 've read it 
Yeah 
Right 
You don't imagine going back to novels 
I mean obviously you do 
Oh no 
To me it 's a waste of time 
Quite 
Thank you 
Three days 
Four days

I 'm such a mug 
I didn't realise that Simon was certified 
No wonder 
I know 
But uh it would 've been nice if I had known I think 
Mm 
Yes 
Purely for the sake that it wouldn't come as such a shock afterwards 
No 
Well he 's put his certificate on his wall 
Obviously didn't know he was round his office while you were being interviewed 
Mm 
Are we going to get that fan 
The fan will be 
That 's the trouble with this this room

And they were saying wait until the summer 
because it 's the coolest room in the building 
Which means it 'll come next month 
That 's nice of them 
Uhm 
I don't know 
Not that I 've really noticed 
No 
She 's probably 
Well not into it 
but I would be interested in it 
You 're not doing doodles of to represent our characters are you

No 
Longer than that now

It 's not something I buy all that often but uh 
They do tend to last 
This conversation was supposed to get personal 
Right

You can't get much more personal than this 
You can be as personal as you like 
We 've had some quite steamy ones 
Well if you get me interviewed

No 
Uhm 
It was nice 
Yes it was a bit 
Oh that sounds good 
Really that 's good 
Yes

But then it means that the more the things they put on the menu the tinier the amount they give you 
Uhm 
Yeah I suppose that 's so 
The bargain hunting eat 
So all right what did I have 
I had monkfish 
Monkfish

Did you 
Yes you 're probably

I don't know 
from which the juices were running into the young vines 
That 's quite disgusting 
Sorry we 
My D H Lawrence was swept away 
It was actually 
She left it on the sea shore 
It was swept away 
It was swept away by the ocean 
No no no 
I 'm sure it was it wa it was that that topless fat woman we saw 
The waves 
The waves of feeling 
Or that couple 
Perhaps it was the peasant wom girl who got it 
You know as we were just going there was a girl sort of with a 
No I didn't mean it like th that 
She had 
Or those peasants perhaps 
She h she had well she had her head covered you know like a local 
But it wasn't local 
That was the point

It was really pretty 
Mind you 
It wasn't local

You never did get that joke

Tried to explain it 
Matthew tried to explain it to you you know 
Well of course he wouldn't 
Come on 
Yes 
But come on 
never heard of claustrophobia in his life 
His mother did anyway 
Uh

The funny thing th oh yes with her I was flailing around 
Yes 
Thomas to go over to Charles to 
Daphnis and something again 
Yeah 
Daphnis and Chloe Ariadne and Theseus 
Yes so 
Yes 
classical story 
Oh did he 
Snodgrassing 
Yes 
Snodgrassing 
Well it 's being recorded 
It 's been done 
Don't like 
I know 
Uhm let me find you something ethnic 
Can I record over it 
Can I record over it 
There 's a word beginning with D that would describe it 
uhm wishy washy 
Don't you think it 's quite 
Everything I despise most 
There 's a word beginning with D for you 
Oh 
Despise 
It says here 
Uh 
Oh yes because at the end he he it 's all modern and then 
and then uhm 
You have you seen The French Lieutenant 's Woman 
It it 's it 's parallelled by b an affair going on in in the m in the modern time 
Yeah 
I wonder if that comes out in the text 
Fowles 
Uhm 
Even Meryl Streep could play it 
Oh yeah I forgot about that 
With your big toe 
Electra 
you 
To the lips ah of others 
Those lips have been pressed and others ere I was were clasped to that breast 
Can we turn this thing off now 
No no no 
Oh why 
Why 
Why 
Well just ignore it 
She 's really squashed the bug 
Get away 
your breast pocket 
Precisely why it 's like a secret agent 's really 
Yes 
I should record a supervision with John Henderson shouldn't I 
Play it back to the to the world 
with Simon Goldhill 
true 
When was it 
Oh yes a-few-words-obscured-by-laughing 
My god I 'll just tell you something which 'll tease you that I know 
I was walking up a street 
Oh that was so funny 
Oh the funniest thing was when I went to wake him up to go and get the plane 
underpants on 
And I just thought well now where shall I poke him to wake him up 
And I thought no I 'll be decent 
So I sort of poked his head 
and anyway he he lay there for a bit 
he turned around 
yes 
and he started saying oh what 're we doing today like this 
He really didn't know honestly 
He was confused because I was in there and confused because he you know he thought we 
complete blankness 
He just didn't understand the situation 
Yes 
Also when yeah he was sitting in a taxi on the way back 
You were on the way to the airport 
he said uh 
he said you know 
just looked at these looked at them I mean 
Uhm 
Yes 
But I think 
I think he 's also not used to travelling and backpacking all that kind of thing 
so he 's not used to kind of having to to suddenly peg it to the 
Mind you you can't say I am but 
Yeah 
And have a 
Exactly 
Yeah 
so that horrible bug can not report me any more 
But he is quite delightful isn't he 
Laura said he seemed to know everything about my background and I thought it was awful 
She will not 
No the funniest thing was the the friend of mine yeah the Liz I went to India with 
Why can't she talk 
I don't understand 
Well her Dad 's kind of very well brought up 
and he went to Oxford and everything 
and he is a journalist 
and her mother was illegitimate 
and she wasn't very well educated and stuff 
so she is all you know 
she is a secretary 
and she is 
Anyway so Laura knew immediately that she had elocution 
Mind you it was quite o obvious 
A careerist 
Was it her daughter 
But I mean it was quite obvious anyway cos it sounds so cultured sometimes so I mean 
Oh I see 
Mrs Thatcher had elocution lessons didn't she yeah yeah 
Nothing could make that voice apart from artificial training 
is quite useful cos it can help you use your voice properly I mean in terms of care of your vocal 
I mean I get really tired 
Well you could have it if you 're lecturing couldn't you 
lecturing sort of 
Precisely 
I mean can you hear my voice today 
That 's from two and a half hours lecturing this morning 
Teaching 
I was going to say I mean there is only one person in here Laura 
to talk to you about public speaking 
Yeah yeah but you were lecturing 
No no I was teaching 
We will come to your lectures Laura 
yeah you notice it very much so though don't you between I mean something like 
I mean I mean Goldhill 's lectures are so much more sort of stirring than some other people 's 
They are just 
Because he is so 
Especially on the top a mountain 
and the bubbling brook 
you know what I mean 
Well I don't think I know quite what you mean 
You are an inventor of things Elizabeth 
I 've never really touched that stuff you know 
Is it it 's like tonic water isn't it 
No 
Yeah it 's fizzy tonic water 
Yeah 
Yeah 
It doesn't do anything for anyone 
I don't like fizzy water anyway 
I don't like sparkling wines all that much 
Do you 
T V 's gross 
I like the sweet ones 
No I don't 
Do you 
Yeah 
No 
I don't like them too I don't like them too dry either 
Yeah 
They 're all right if they 're dry 
Why are you making that face 
I don't like them 
We had a uhm very sweet uhm ros&eacute; the other day 
Hey he 's got some tea that bloke hann'e hasn't he 
That 's what I was thinking 
Yes 
What champagne were we drinking 
Asti sweet 
No it 's not sweet 
It 's very dry 
Champagne 
Don't like champagne either 
No 
Well then I say that 
Bikers yeah 
Oh that 's not the same 
I think if they put in a a red grape or a ros&eacute; grape or something 
Do they 
Uh 
Think so 
Cos we had pink champagne at Roy and Louise 's for their fiftieth wedding anniversary 
Pink champagne 
Yes 
Pink champagne 
What 's it like 
Any good 
Well it was red 
Well it 's just like fizzy fizzy light wine really 
I don't like champagne at the best of times 
No I don't 
Whose wedding anniversary 
Roy 's and Louise 
Roy and Louise yes 
with roses and things 
Yeah 
Seventy one recently uh 
Is he as old as that 
is he 
I thought he was younger than that 
Yes he 's seventy-one 
Mm 
Yes 
He 's seventy-one 
It was quite a nice do otherwise 
She 'd got lovely food all laid out 
and everybody was eating something 
And it was a beautiful day 
and she had borrowed everybody 's patio chairs and things and had them all over the lawn 
It was rather nice actually cos we were all outside 
thrilled with it all 
They had so many flowers they didn't know what to do with them 
Somebody had been in to talk to uhm Pauline next door to borrow all her vases 
and then it was Pauline 's birthday a day or two afterwards 
and she got her sent a huge sheaf of flowers by her son 
So she came round to me 
but it was only Stuart here 
and she didn't want to bother him with vases and things cos she didn't know where I kept them or anything cos we were in Bromley Den and I 
so she was sort of sh when I went round there in the afternoon she asked me round for a cup of tea when I got back and uhm she 'd baked a cake you see and there were all these flowers everywhere in coffee jars anything she could lay her hands on 
And she said all I want is a vase 
I said well you st still can but she said oh I can't 
It took me an hour to arrange them in that lot 
I can't do it all over 
Oo 
Put the nearest one 
Tsk God 
Oh no 
listen 
Do you want cake 
Oh no 
What 's this 
Atlantic City 
But it was so funny you know 
She hadn't got a vase in the place 
Oh dear 
And I 've got masses of vases I could have lent her 
Yeah we used to buy Mum a vase every year for her birthday 
Yes 
So we got uh inundated with them 
We never use any of them hardly 
I mean it 's just amazing 
No 
Uhm looks the part as well 
When was it made this 
Nineteen eighty-one 
Several years ago 
But you find usually that there are one or two that you use all the time and others you never use from one year to the next 
Yeah 
I find that always 
We don't usually have flowers 
I mean I got some dried flowers in vases but that 's about it 
How old is he now 
Seventy-seven or thereabouts 
Oh I do I do like flowers 
I do buy them 
uhm on the other hand you only use one or two don't you 
Sixty-seven 
sheet is it really 
They 're quite expensive nowadays 
No 
They 're quite expensive nowadays 
And I mean I had one or two 
My brother-in-law 's quite sweet 
he sends one to a birthday or Christmas or something and once a year I need a great big vase you know 
Like a tadpole tank really 
And I have to and it sort of comes out about three times a year and the rest of the time it skulks somewhere you know 
That 's the trouble 
it 's the storage isn't it 
Yeah 
This is it 
It only took us about twenty minutes to get here 
Well that 's 
Wasn't the road busy at all 
They all go to the pub don't they 
Mm 
They just go to the pub 
Yeah 
I said to Nora she might be going back about two in the night 
I don't like the idea of going into the dark but I suppose you 're used to it aren't you 
It 's all right 
It 's not too bad 
Yes 
Yeah 
And kitty 's there 
The cat will attack anyone won't 
Oh yes 
Well actually she 'll run for it probably 
I suppose she 's fully grown now 
Fat 
Fat now 
Yeah 
Well she 's not 
Just a fully grown cat 
She 's company though isn't she 
Yeah 
She 's very grown 
Yes 
She is 
She has her days when she 's affectionate and days when she 's not but 
They 're not predictable really 
But you couldn't have a dog leaving it all day could you 
yeah 
It wouldn't be fair 
No 
Really 
Dogs need exercise 
Yeah exactly 
Well it 's not that 
They need company more than cats 
Do you let her out through the cat flap 
I don't think we want any of this do we 
Yeah 
in the morning 
Yes 
Yeah 
Shall we turn this off and 
Yeah 
Turn it off Richard love 
She 's like an alarm clock 
She wakes me up at six every morning 
Mm 
Yeah 
Horrible it is 
Oh dear 
That is a bit premature isn't it 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Tell Mum what time we got to work 
Why 
In the morning 
Is that the time you 're supposed to get there 
Yes 
Mm 
Good grief 
It 's quite it 's quite good 
I was very alert yesterday 
three-or-four-words 
Yeah 
She does heaps of hours 
Heaps of what 
Hours 
Oh do you 
Yes 
Trouble is there 's only me 
Well there is two people but he doesn't do any of them 
but uh 
Yeah 
Where d' you have you applied for somewhere else uhm 
I 've applied to Wellcome in Beckenham 
Oh that 'll be handy wouldn't it 
Yeah 
It 'd b be about a half-hour journey isn't it 
Yes 
Now funnily enough this fi these people that we went to for this fiftieth wedding anniversary uhm 
the lady there 
she used to work at Boroughs Wellcome 
uh was quite high up I think cos she had degree 
And I think she 's got one or two bugs or something named after her now 
Mm 
Cor 
So quite sort of uh 
And yet you come to think of it you 'd never think she did anything like that 
She 's she 's a quite a a sweet crumbly sort of person really when you speak to her 
Yes 
You 'd never think she did anything so scientific 
I dunno don't know whether you can carry any more to get through the door can you 
Fluffy 
I can just about carry it 
Mind you 
Careful Stuart 
Thank you 
And where else 
Oh Nottingham 
A job in nu University of Nottingham 
Oh God d' you want to go up there 
Well I i it 's cheaper up there 
We are seriously considering selling the house 
Mm 
Are you really 
And moving up north 
Mm 
Because 
The only thing is is at the moment Helen it 's an awful trouble to sell 
Yeah this is it 
So e if I get the job I 'll rent for a while until the house prices pick up but 
Mm 
That 's an idea 
Yeah 
you know and then have ready cash as well 
Yes 
You 'd be able to afford it up there wouldn't you 
I mean we 'd take out a little mortgage 
Yeah 
I mean you wouldn't necessarily need a house 
I mean a flat or something would do you each wouldn't it 
Yeah exactly 
Is it your brother who knew Peter 
Yes yes 
He 's he used to go about with Peter 
Peter yes 
My brother my brother 
Obviously was yeah 
He 's my age isn't he 
Oh God how old is he 
He 's oh twenty-eight 
Yeah 
Twenty-eight 
Same as me only a few months younger 
Mm 
Yeah 
He might be 
When 's your birthday 
Seventh 
I always forget his birthdate 
I think 
Two months younger 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I always forget 
Are you planning to move to a new flat 
You got to have the money though haven't you 
Yeah this is it 
Well if she sold the house they 've got at the moment 
You see they live in she lives in her mother 's house at the moment 
but 
Mm 
Yeah 
Dunno don't know 
What about the father 
He living with you 
Oh no 
No not now 
No 
What 's happened to him then 
Dunno don't know 
Can you wash those few cups up uhm Rich Stuart please 
Least you it 's good news for you though innit isn't it 
right yeah 
Yeah 
It 's nice and quiet 
I 've got it all to myself and the cat 
It 's really good 
Good luck to you 
Yeah 
We could have wild parties and things 
I see 
Well I could have parties and things 
She 's planning one 
Are you planning parties 
She 's planning a wild party aren't you 
Yeah 
Haven't got enough people though 
They don't want to come down from London 
It 's too far I think 
Uhm 
That 's the trouble if you 're out a bit isn't it 
Yeah 
I mean it 's s b tuks through the Blackwall Tunnel it 'll probably take about half an hour or an hour 
lives with someone 
I mean she lives out in the wilds somewhere 
She sort of keeps asking them to things but that was twice she 's asked them to things hasn't she 
And I mean it 's you know a bit difficult for people to get there 
That 's the trouble 
Well actually the thing i is it 's not even particularly far 
It 's just the travel 
Yes 
The difficulty is the travel 
You know it 's all right if you 've got a car but 
I mean i it was 
you have to go to Cambridge and get the village bus out 
And it took over three and a half hours to get there and over three and a half hours to get back and uh probably four all told 
Involves getting the tube 
so 
Not worth it is it 
No 
Certainly wasn't worth it 
No 
I met a girl on the train today 
You picked up a girl on the train 
I did not pick her up 
I met her 
Sorry 
Uh you met a girl on the train 
What 's the difference between meeting and picking up 
You picked her up and dropped her did you 
Picked her up and dropped her yeah 
Only to pick her up again 
Oh well if you 've got her telephone number you picked her up 
Did you get her telephone number 
I got her phone number 
You picked her up 
Uhm I 'm sorry everybody then 
What sort of a girl is she 
Well 
Is she Chinese 
No she 's English 
She 's the first English girl I 've spoken to for about three or four years I think 
A very strange feeling 
It 's an English girl 
Yes quite 
What sort of English girl 
saying 
but she 
Yeah 
Even more frightening than knowing they can understand what you 're saying 
That 's what I said 
Oh I see I thought you said it was very frightening being able to understand what they were saying 
Yes 
Yes the English are branded on their tongue as they say don't they so uh as soon as you speak you know they usually know what an idiot you are 
lower middle-class in that case 
as grouping uhm 
or maybe a B one 
Uhm 
She 's a student at Saint Martin 's I think 
Is she 
B one means she 's she 's pretty sort of 
Are you talking about appearance now 
No 
her 
On appearance 
This is class evidently 
Uh s start with class 
three-or-four-words 
Yes right 
That 's right isn't it 
Yes yes so that 's it 
Yes yes that 's right 
We were estimating her income 
I mean if she 's a student at Saint Martin 's she would would presumably be covered 
No no but I 'm saying if she had 
accent and so on 
It 's what she earns 
Her parents get 
Yeah 
uh and appearance 
Appearances don't go A one and A two 
Right 
Where was she 
That 's pretty good 
I 've heard that 's very good and uh uh i it 's a very 
it 's a very hard 
Not bad 
Uh uh uh what do you mean below below half way down the ratings 
There 's a very severe judge this 
I should imagine he is yes yes 
Nobody here is above eight 
Tha tha tha that 's three-or-four-words 
Anyway anyway anyway Louis tell us some tell us more about her 
I don't know much about her 
I 've got her phone number right here 
The thing is what 's the etiquette of this 
You 're then meant to wait a couple of days before you ring them up or else it appears uncool you know 
Ring her tomorrow and invite her out 
Just say I happen to be going to the theatre and I have two tickets 
Credit line 
Is that all I say 
Yeah 
Well there 's there 's there 's 
Don't ask me what you say 
You 're the expert at this 
And there is the other policy adopted by a friend of mine who always lets thirteen days pass 
however attractive she was he counted off thirteen days and then rang her 
Yeah 
Ah you see 
would find it hard to uh ba be attractive 
he always felt that he he he 'd 
Person 'd be intrigued by the thirteen day gap 
She 'd be so confident she 'd got him 
that he 'd ring 
him 
Uhm 
Uhm 
But that sounds as if he had uh he was blas&eacute; slightly blas&eacute; 
Do you want to appear blas&eacute; 
Ring her tomorrow 
Can you appear blas&eacute; 
Uh I don I don't know 
Yes of course 
If you rang her now she 'd say yes Louis 
I bet you ten quid on it 
I mean it 
or this institute 
Not quite 
There is a novel 
Or a short story 
There is a short story 
A crime novel 
Have you I mean it it it 
What do they do 
I don't know I mean 
Well I mean say eighteenth century uhm relationships between men and women were very different because if it was a low class woman 
and then and then goes home regretting that he had not brought a sheath with him and fearing they were going to be 
He does invari if I remember Boswell 's London Journal he almost invariably does 
Has thirty days on mercury cures 
three-or-four-words very painful for 
That 's right 
Straight after the Dean 's sermon as well 
God it must 've been awful in those days 
How would you arrange these things without a telephone 
What did they do 
I don't know what they did 
Uhm 
Well they dropped cards in I suppose the doors 
Or was that nineteenth century 
Wonder what people do now 
I think that 's more nineteenth century 
Below them I mean 
Who knows 
Cos they did didn't they c c there was 
there was certain intimacy in the eighteenth century 
People were in 
Uhm 
It was more like now than the nineteenth century was 
three-or-four-words 
Uhm I think the nineteenth cent 
And where you were 
picking women up and 
these days 
Oh I know where we were 
Dickens 
Now Dickens setting his uh Tale of Two Cities has the meeting of the I forget the name of the girl or the man 
indeed so uh probably boring both of them uhm characters 
Uh the the Frenchman who marries the doctor 's daughter 
I know yes yes 
Now they meet on the on the packet sailing from England don't they 
And all Dickens says that he he he called on the doctor 
And I think that was the etiquette 
And Othello of course calls on uh Desdemona 's father doesn't he and then he tells her the story of his life 
Yes right 
Really 
I think I 've got this together eventually 
Yes oh that 's nice 
Does she play tennis 
Haven't gone into that yet 
Uh 
Coming back from work was she 
Oh no she 's a student 
She 's a student 
Is it Martin 's 
Is it School of Art 
That 's right yeah 
Uhm 
Suitable isn't it 
One tearing up canvases 
Do you think that an artist should uhm live with another artist 
No 
I don't know 
Robin what do you think 
Uh what about 
An arti can 
Does an artist have to live with an artist 
Yes 
What happens 
I don't see why 
Uh do do they have to or can they 
Brow well uh Browning and uhm and Emily you see lived together 
Browning and uh 
Elizabeth 
Uhm 
I don't know 
understanding of women 
Bank managers 
No I think I would certainly want to live with someone that could understand one 's own angst and anxieties 
You don't want to live with them 
You 're not a neurotic wreck on the other hand uhm 
Anyway it 's nice to have met her 
I can only see the book being about a thousand pages long 
that 's the trouble 
So complex 
Will anyone congratulate me on my cooking 
Oh look at that 
Uh this is comes entirely from Marks and Spencer 's 
Doesn't it look delicious though 
And all I had to do was heat it up 
and was had excellent treatment and was just jolly lucky he 'd insured himself because it would have cost uh uh the absolute 
And fraught 
and uh the car sent back 
and everything 
It actually covered the whole lot 
Yes 
Yes 
Uhm yes 
Uhm yes 
Yes 
Yeah 
I don't know anyone else who could do it 
Yeah 
I expect it was three-or-four-words 
Say that 's right three-or-four-words 
And I think well I don't know 
Does insurance cover hotels 
I think so 
I I think it does cover expenses incurred by the end 
Yeah 
Uhm 
So it 's always worth it 
yeah 
At last 
I mean I was 
It seems very expensive 
I mean our our five star is nearly a hundred pounds 
Is it 
In fact we had a horror didn't we on the way t to Holland cos we weren't insured just three-or-four-words 
And we all of a sudden we all of a sudden we thought oh gosh 
The moment we go uninsured 
But uhm 
Yes 
We we couldn't find anywhere cos it was a bank holiday 
we couldn't find anywhere open to insure ourselves 
But of course it 's the one time you went without 
But we managed to find somewhere on the motorway I think at this service station 
Yeah 
Yes 
Yes 
Quite incredible we 
we caught the evening boat and we got there and we changed some money 
No it was at Sh uh Sheerness 
Sheerness 
And we went on up on to the boat and there was nobody there 
And we walked up to the customs desk 
Nobody in sight at all 
Yeah I thought it was massive sort of old fort there 
Yes 
They 've got this film on the old Martello forts 
about eight hundred 
The boat seats uh I mean sleeps fifteen hundred you see 
And but they 'd all gone on earlier it appears 
so you 've got to try and elbow your way through 
And in the restaurant there was all this space and the place and the thing was absolutely crammed 
There were hundreds of cabins 
And there were still hundreds of people on it but it was so big this boat that you didn't didn't meet them 
Even off the boat 
You could walk to our cabins and not meet a soul 
To complete the story Polly and I got up in the middle of the night 
cos we couldn't sleep 
Well it s s sleeps fifteen hundred yeah 
Uhm 
We we didn't see a single person 
It 's certainly the way to travel 
We did see a couple of duty crew through a window 
It was quite uncanny because we were walking round the boat in the middle of the North Sea at three o'clock in the morning 
There wasn't anybody around 
Yeah 
Right 
Yeah 
We could have had a cabin overnight and been there in the morning ready to drive away 
The going in the top bunk syndrome 
And and the thing is it 's much cheaper than the Dover to Calais really even though 
You said seven hours 
Did I 
You said it 's cheaper 
Yes yes 
In the summer you can take a car and four people for a hundred and twenty pounds 
What 
with a cabin 
Well it 's a much less popular route 
With a cabin 
Yeah 
It 's b we can't 
Well because we 've already pay I 'd already paid the whole lot you see 
It 's less convenient cos it it lands you in Flushing which for most people is far too far up 
Is that in Holland 
Only just 
Only just 
But it 's far too far up 
Especially across the Belgian border 
Yeah 
Not now 
But for us going to Vienna it would have been all right 
And it it the boats are fantastic 
Uhm 
Oh it i uh abs I mean it uhm 
I mean 
And this is this luxury thing 
Yes i 
The boats are 
The restaurants 
Is there a swimming pool 
Well the swimming pool 's not worth talking about 
Yes three-or-four-words 
But the restaurant was so posh we just couldn't possibly have considered it th th 
There was a thing called a carvery which had a vast menu and you could 
You paid about 
I don't know 
how much was it 
about eight pounds per person 
and you could you could have anything you wanted as many times as you 
because 
was nice 
Yeah 
Mm 
Mm 
it would be a godsend 
Oh it would uh it would be a great blessing if they can s they can s speak for a half an hour or something 
it would be 
Oh good 
Cos they can make her feel easier because I think she feels she 's being rather an intrusion 
Well will you tell her that you might save Rebecca from complete despair because being exposed twice within a month would be rather awful for her 
I mean who did you say you s found in Scotland 
Yeah 
Have a game of table tennis or something 
Well our friends from Broadstairs the one the one who 's moving Pippa 
Clare 's friends the one who 's moving Pippa 
Pippa 
What were they doing up there 
They had a holiday 
They just they booked a holiday in Scotland not knowing where we are going at all 
Well they just hired a cottage 
Cos we did it sort of rather last minute 
Oh I see 
how many miles of each other 
Thirty 
Twenty 
Twenty twenty-five or so miles 
Mm 
Li&egrave;ge Aachen 
That 's very quick all that route down there 
Is it mm 
Mm 
four hours 
Four hours 
It 's a very fast road all the way 
I think it actually goes through Brussels doesn't it the motorway 
Yes 
Well there 's a ring road 
Mm 
Yeah 
Just wondering who we who we can persuade to swap with us next year maybe 
Cou aren't you going to do it through an agency then 
Well 
No 
Why not 
We might do but 
Well cos we 've always done it through personal contacts 
What about those Norwegian people 
It didn't it it was 
The Dutch one 
Well there were so many Dutch people wanting to come here that you could have had almost anything 
We weren't always 
Uhm 
Yeah or that you match 
The Dutch was nice 
And that actually worked out very well 
But it turned out to be lovely with a huge sort of lake on our doorstep with developed as a sort of plan d' eau sort of thing 
Yeah 
It was a nice 
Oh wonderful 
Did you get good weather or 
And and it was 
And then we had a hot week didn't we 
boiling hot 
And whole of the city came out 
Yes 
Hot 
What was it like in Scotland 
did you say 
Hot 
Hot 
Hot 
You had that you had that hot weather 
Well it wasn't the whole time cos I climbed Cairngorn one morning and I couldn't see a thing 
One day we went up on the chair lift and it was bright sunshine 
You could see for miles 
At the end it began to be a bit drizzly but for Scotland it was sensational 
Yeah 
Mm 
Where were you then Audrey 
What was Easter like 
I can't remember now 
Not in Inverness 
Yes 
It was nice 
It was close enough 
You could I could dr I could just drive to the uhm foot of Cairngorn walk up the whole mountain and back again before lunch 
Well it 
After Easter 
Really 
Uhm 
Oh 
Four and a half thousand feet 
Cor 
Good heavens 
Well just under 
Sec second highest mountain 
Well higher than Snowdon 
It takes a whole day to get up Snowdon 
How do you get get that 
How can you get up there then 
Well there 's a car park 
You can you drive up to the chair lift bottom 
and it 's a path I mean it 's it 's 
it 's almost a road in fact 
It 's quite high before you start 
Yeah 
Uhm 
Yeah 
Oh I see 
Was it crowded 
Yeah 
on top 
No 
Oh it 's one of those 
What a nuisance 
No 
I 
Uhm 
Oh I see 
Bertie and I were three-or-four-words 
Sorry 
We weren't in Aviemore which is a nauseous place 
Oh Aviemore is revolting just a little bit 
There 's the garden there 
Uhm 
Oh I see 
Yes 
And that 's six hundred and fifty miles from here or so 
When you go to Italy are you going to be doing art 
Art galleries and 
Well a bit if we can 
I mean we uh we couldn't go to Florence and not not see some art 
three-or-four-words 
Uhm 
Actually the heat in that part of Italy is not as great as when you get south of the Rhone 
There 's a tremendous difference 
Yes yeah 
Oh good 
Which wine 
Isn't it coq au vin 
No 
That 's why I was surprised it was in strips 
Oh I dunno don't know 
Coq au vin 
What 
Yes dear 
Yes pleasen beginnen 
Oh come off it 
You said you were going to make coq au vin 
Yessen 
Yes 
Why not 
have you ever had coq au vin 
Well yes 
Uh yes 
I did 
Naomi thought this was coq au vin 
made with wine 
Mhm 
Yes 
What is it 
It 's called uh country style chicken style chicken a la la Ken Hom Hom 
So it 's 
Oh coq au kitchen 
I should think 
Coq au paysage 
Coq au campagne 
What are you laughing at 
speaking in Hamlet 's terms 
Shut up Dad 
Well Hamlet said uh uh huh 
Hamlet was rude again 
Do you think Shakespeare really saw all these things in 
I think 
read more into it 
I mean I don't know whether he really did 
Was he really that you know 
Yes 
No no 
I think he tried to 
In that sort of thing 
Yes 
Yes 
Absolutely 
Yes 
Yes 
I am quite sure 
He was bawdy all right 
Really 
Was he 
Oh yes 
I think so 
How do you know 
I 'm afraid I think the I think I think the uhm that chicken is supposed to be a bit juicier 
But the rice is very good 
I like it very much 
You know 
It 's all in ju juice 
Sorry 
Mhm 
Uhm basmati 
No 
It 's juicy 
The way you cook it 
It 's very juicy 
I think 
Can you cook any rice this way 
Well it 's just measuring the quantities very carefully 
Done to a T 
Oh uhm 
No 
I didn't mean that 
Glottal stop 
Gk gk gk 
A uvular something 
I don't know 
It 's a turd 
A turd mm 
What are you talking about you two 
We 're talking about saying done to a turn 
No not 
You 're rude 
Turn 
Sorry 
Not yet 
No thank you 
Excuse me 
I hope you don't mind my rubbing my hands 
cold 
Did you have a sleep 
Mm 
I snoozed like anything 
Can't remember what I dreamt about very much 
Forward 
Mhm 
She said she thought that the the bag was something of a joke and you might think it was funny 
you know great fun 
And I said 
well I said to her 
shall I keep it here till the summer 
And I said you said you were going to use it round Cambridge 
bought as much for a laugh as anything else 
she said I 've given it to another friend of mine who said she 's certainly going to keep it till the summer 
And I said I think she 's going to be using it round she said she was going to be using it round Cambridge 
So 
Mm 
No 
Yup 
Naomi you can take your pick 
Naomo Naomo 
I meant to give it to you earlier 
A bit of a problem because she thought it couldn't be Naomo 
She didn't think it was Naomo 
Who 's this 
Alison 
Mhm 
Naomo 
Naomo 
Mm 
Bloody well say so 
A lot of support does it 
It 's great actually 
Mhm 
If you want to take it 
That 's quite extreme 
But certainly 
When was that 
I couldn't I couldn't do anything with the wrist 
It was very painful like when your plaster came off 
I was going ah ah ah 
And he said what 's the matter 
what 's the matter 
I said it 's my wrist 
As he took the plaster off I mean it was agonising 
I said I can't move my wrist 
And in fact he saw me and was very good about m m my saying my wrist elbow 's all right 
So uhm he finally 
Oh dear 
What cos it was painful without your 
mhm 
And I mean I still you know I 
This is something I still just occasionally wear 
Or did you have it 
This is Rebecca 's 
This this bit was Rebecca 's but I think 
I 've got some upstairs in my room too 
I 've got this 
This is yours 
I think this is too thin 
uh it does cos it 's looking very ribby so you can cut yourself another piece 
I kept these old things and I wear them used to wear them in the garden sometimes 
Dad will you have some more juice 
That one 
Yes I will 
I 'm eating Helen 's with that 
you try them in a minute 
It 's very nice 
When I 'm riding my bike 
Yes 
Oh I 'm going to go up over them 
As we chop it around into slices 
we can cut this back 
How do you get it just right 
See how you get on 
This is fine 
Yes 
That was the smallest one 
I think that 's probably a child 's size 
So you can try them in a minute 
Mm 
Mm 
I think that would be a good idea 
Mm 
Yes 
This looks delicious 
one of us was 
Mm 
you were very on time 
Absolutely on time 
Mm she was on time 
Mm 
I was ready at seven 
I know you were 
Mm 
I don't think you can do it very well 
Mm 
Mhm 
Mm 
Well I thought that I thought we were going to have coq au vin 
It is chicken after all 
Is it coq au vin 
It 's Chinese 
No it 's not au vin 
I didn't think it was 
It 's Chinese 
Well I didn't think it was either 
Chinese 
That 's why I said is this coq au vin 
Mm 
I don't know 
really 
Isn't it coq au vin 
Yes but 
It 's a lighter colour in China 
And coq au vin is completely different 
Well yes 
But I just 
Yes 
But I didn't know you 'd changed your mind 
bacon and 
That 's why I said 
is this coq au vin 
Dad was making such rude jokes earlier on 
Oh dear 
I said I got it from Radio Four 
That doesn't excuse anything 
Not the bit about the country 
I heard that on on Radio Four 
What 
Coq au vin 
I didn't hear it on Radio Four 
I did I assure you 
aren't you love 
Tell us about the bishop of Birmingham because I want to know the third line 
It 's that bad is it 
Yes 
No 
No it 's not 
because you 're very courteous and you 'll try and talk 
That 's strange 
What is it 
It 's the wine 
It 's Joan 's 
minus the coq 
you can break into the pears if you want to or have a piece of choccy 
A piece of choccy 
What do you mean 
Well you bought some and I bought some 
Oh you bought some did you 
Oh 
I bought exactly the same thing only I bought the uh the Tobler version 
Oh 
I wouldn't mind uhm a pear 
Just one 
You know Gerry actually talks refers to my mother 's bedroom as the boudoir 
When she answers the phone she says Mrs French 's residence 
Yes I should think she 
Aw 
Sorry 
We are being bitchy 
Boudoir 
God you do have to be careful don't you 
Mm 
Do I mean Nancy 
I can never remember which Mitford is which 
I think so yes 
How do you mean 
Well there 's an awful lot of things that your mother says which are distinctly non-U 
Oh my God 
Mirror 
bollocks 
I mean who who says 
Well of course it is but uh 
Who says 
I 've never heard anybody 
Y You 're not telling me looking-glass is correct 
Yes 
Oh good grief 
No 
It 's not correct 
It 's U 
Who says 
Nancy Mitford 
Or glass 
No I mean I mean she she wrote the book but uh or wrote the the chapter in the book but it was after a very fearful investigation of what really U people say 
Nonsense 
Anyway she 'd been talking to the wrong people 
But people do say glass uh I can assure you 
I should uh I 've I 've 
Yeah 
Yeah all right 
Well actually a glass means two things 
It means a barometer or a mirror 
Oh how confusing 
But scent and uh 
I 'm not but 
H How do you know 
Does she ca call it perfume 
Yes 
Oh 
Oh 
Yes uh in fact there 's a there 's a tendency towards the nice actually about your mother 
No 
I 'd never say it to her face 
No 
No 
Oh well I have a theory that unless you 're born U you can never talk U 
I think that 's actually the truth 
I think it probably is up to a point 
upper-middle class probably wouldn't he 
Yes 
Well there you go 
Probably for Peggy 
Oh hello Albert 
Your dad 
OK 
That doesn't seem to have a pause button on it so 
At least I think I will 
Uhm yes she did 
I think it was you know 
Oh well 
What are we going to do 
Oh dear is it looking dodgy 
He 's opening his mouth very wide just now 
Yeah 
It 's that same old problem 
Oh dear 
Sarah had phoned me on Sunday 
And then I remembered of course she had cos that was why we went over 
I think that was Sunday wasn't it 
Well she 'd been down there 
Had a very good day 
Uhm 
She 'd been down there on Saturday 
Oh had she 
Yeah 
What 
Down to see him 
Yeah 
Gosh 
That 's good of her 
Yeah 
Mm 
Yes 
And I don't think it 's actually quite as good 
Yeah 
Yes 
This costs sixty-nine p and it 's a hundred grammes 
What What 's this 
In fact the chocolate 's almost identical isn't it 
It 's uh fifty the Toblerone 
Oh there 's so much stuff here 
Yeah it 's hard to find and it 's in very small print 
It doesn't seem to have a weight on it actually but it looks about the same 
If anything it seems lighter 
Well has some been eaten or uh 
Whoops 
Drat 
What What 's the chocolate in that one 
Fifty-six 
Yeah 
Mm 
Yeah 
Mm 
Mind you actually I think Tob 's marvellous 
How did Peggy get on with her guitar 
I 'm not sure I ever got round to asking her 
Well I don't know is the short answer because she uh never actually answered the question when I asked her 
Ah 
I asked her but she never answered the question when I asked her 
I mean I always get the feeling it was a grave disappointment in some way but uh whether that 's 
Yeah 
Actually I 'm not sure it is 
That wasn't deliberate 
Oop 
Mm 
How many d' you get 
Mm 
No I meant to put the cream in front of a mike 
Two 
Why 
How many have you got 
Well I 've had three 
OK 
about all those places 
Victoria or whatever 
Mm 
There 's probably the twenty-four bus 
A fair old walk you know 
Twenty-four bus 
Ge Where does it go 
Doesn't go anywhere near there 
Yes it does 
No it doesn't 
Yes it does 
It goes along uhm whatever that road is called Constantine Road 
No it doesn't 
Well I suppose it does but it doesn't come back anywhere near you 
It certainly does because I remember 
Yes it goes along uhm 
Yeah 
That 's not far is it 
Yes 
But having said that I mean that 's it you know 
from West Hampstead 
Mm 
There must be bu buses going along Mansfield Road 
Yes it do does actually on 
one of the problems is that the uhm 
So the garden is facing north-east 
I think it 's probably academic 
Mm yes I can't see it now 
C eleven 
The front faces south-west uhm 
Mm 
Mm 
Well 
Two thirty maybe 
on top he 's hardly likely to suddenly come right down again 
I 've broken off two by mistake 
I 'll try and break break them 
Oh 
I 've succeeded 
Mm 
Who is the he incidentally 
I don't know 
Some interfering son-in-law 
Yes 
and the rest of it 's sort of derelict or totally deserted 
and just that ground floor 
Looks as if it might well have been doesn't it 
And presumably for some time it 's been like that 
Mm 
Very spooky 
I bet there 's a lot of places around like that 
Yeah 
But they said that it was too much for her 
Mm 
she 's only living at the bottom of the hall 
But the fridge was completely emptied out 
Mm 
She 's not living there now 
She 's not 
No 
I I mean she 's obviously going in there from time to time cos there is a letter addressed to her here in Palmers Green 
Ah 
Cos the bed was made up 
Oh that 's right 
It said she 'd moved there 
Oh yes 
take it over pretty quickly 
Mm 
Well well 
That woman from the Prince 's Trust incidentally 
I 'd much rather buy from them than I would from bloody Benham and bloody boring Reid 
Oh yes 
Sorry what 
Mm 
Ha ha 
No 
I think she would have said if she was that close to it 
She would have said oh God I wouldn't send my son there 
We 're far too close to it 
It is funny that the all the houses that have come up have been in Lisburne Shirlock Estelle Road 
Nothing in Roderick Road nothing in Courthope 
Oh yes there was one in Cressy Road 
the road that 's too short for its name 
M A C small N full stop 
Mac 
Macken 
Not Mackenzie 
One in Cressy 
But what is the first one there 
It is Crecy Road 
It 's Cressy Road Macken-whatever Road Lisburne Roderick Shirlock Courthope Estelle Mona 
Rona 
Mona 
Oh Crecy 's the first one is it 
Let 's take a look at the Mackies 
Rona 
It 's actually rather a nice one that 
It 's sort of got a curve in it 
They must have been his daughters mustn't they Rona and uh 
What 
And Estelle 
And Estelle 
Builders always give 
And his son was Roderick 
I would think almost certainly 
And maybe he had a son called Shirlock 
Ha ha 
It 's quite possible 
Shirl for short 
brief summary of the uh part that we would contribute Jan Aarts and I to your uhm your project with L S E 
Now I 've just been working on this and and the problem has been to a certain extent the printer 
That also contains typos so 
Which printer is this 
Uh this is the I B M Pro 
yes the I B M Proprinter 
uh the file I had just created under Wordperfect 
Really 
Really 
I 've not heard that we 're having any trouble with it 
Did you ask anybody there 
Uhm Gerry 
Uh what did he say 
uh he in fact set it up because I don't know how the printing system works here 
Yeah 
Uh very temperamental 
I don't know what all this is about 
Yes indeed 
Uh and how do you uh cope with the temperamentality 
Ah you 've uh upped the number 
it 's thirty-five thousand 
or was it twenty-five thousand 
Yes that 's right yes 
Twenty-five 
That was a mistake by a factor of ten 
How did you manage to make the mistake 
so 
combination 
we had uh five hundred pages and five hundred words per page what I was thinking of initially 
is that in addition to the hundred thousand 
Oh yes yes so that really 
key-punching uh or there wouldn't be much in the way of key-punching 
I suppose it would be optical scanning would it 
No that that 
Uh uh 
Uhm yes I wouldn't 
Would it be typed documents or 
Uh the vast majority would be uh typed 
indeed uh most of the documents would be in a machine readable form 
No not not in the sense of in fact they 're scannable but but on but but on but onto disks 
We would certainly ask for those to reduce the time 
Machine readable form 
No 
So we would uh wh what our job would be would be 
Presumably the first job would be to mark them up 
That 's right yes 
uhm proofreading for typos and that type kind of thing 
Yeah 
Yes 
the discovery of uh typos 
And there 'd be 
I don't 
Sorry 
For the first first phase there wouldn't be very much to do with that type cos these are teaching materials that have been well sort of edited and I would have uhm 
We can get those in a machine readable form so there 's no problem at all with that in the first stage 
uh has all the files 
th th th there would be no no 
there would be no problem at all uh 
What 's a text grammar 
Are you using it in the technical sense of the text grammar 
That 's a discourse grammar 
Yes 
Ye ye yes well I 'm u using it in the sense that one is not looking at uhm in fact sentences 
One is looking at the con the uh the uh where you connect sentences 
One is looking at paragraph uh structure and the ordering of a sequence of uh sentences 
I think this is not going to be done in the short time that you 're talking about 
uh and I 'm not sure how far one would go from the uh tagging and parsing uh to this uh text grammar 
You I thought when you were talking about formal grammar you were talking about a grammar at the sentence level 
something that you would not get uh simply by looking at the parser 
But 
well 
No no this is where the I talk about a 
Of course you have other difficult structures than those two 
Uhm yes and also the rule-based uh knowledge system that one assumes and and that 's part of the uh part of the uh study 
The L S E would be doing that principally and you need I argue an a rule-based knowledge system before you can articulate what a text grammar should be 
And I think that a sentence grammar holds up as a purely linguistic entity 
more uh extra linguistic ina information 
in this case project management 
But that rule-based system is what L S E is providing 
That 's L S E 
Uh L S E will be working on that 
In fact Akiva if uh time permits may also do some work on that as he is interested in doing that for his P H D uh and it would be very useful for the project if he did that 
But basically this is the uh uh in my view the goal which we should be moving towards 
Now it may well be the case that the timescales I have in mind are not in fact realistic and that we need to get the sentence grammar reasonably correct first of all cos that 's 
It depends what you mean by text grammar 
I 'm still not sure 
I mean have you got an example in mind of a text grammar 
Do you have a model of a text grammar that already exists 
Well 
no 
There 's no there 's nothing that I 've seen 
There are bits and pieces towards text grammars in uhm Computational uhm Linguistics predominantly where people are trying to look trying to look at texts 
I think October issue of Computational uh Linguistics there 's an attempt to do something of this type 
Oh 
I 've not seen those 
And this is what in what form does this 
What form does this take 
set of uh uh uh indications of the way in which one can use uh connectives for example between sentences the way you can structure paragraphs to obtain a certain objective 
Not in the sense of uh in the form of formulae 
No but uh uh uh 
I 'd like to see this uh 
I mean the fact is that there has never been a text grammar 
I mean there 've been various uh programmatic statements but I 've never seen a text grammar 
Well until you have the rules-based knowledge representation system uh I 'd maintain you can not possibly have a text grammar 
That 's a necessary condition 
But equally 
So how why are you uh uh asking us to do a text grammar before uh a knowledge grammar 
Well I 'm assuming that the sequence would be uh to develop the sentence grammar the way that it has been done for 
Then the rule-based system would be developed uh at the same time as that 
Uh then what I had in mind was that at the end of the sentence grammar which is a necessary condition of the text grammar of course one would then be able to uh take up the knowledge system that had been developed and uhm create uhm a uh text grammar or protocols for a text grammar based on that particular knowledge system 
I don't think that Jan Aarts 
I 'm not uh uh uh I 'm sure about myself 
I don't know what Jan Aarts would think uh would be able to commit ourselves to producing a text grammar uh uh within any foreseeable time limit that you 're likely to propose 
Uh even the production of a sentence grammar you know limited to a particular domain would be quite a formidable task it seems to me 
Could I 
Yes I think that 's 
Well I think one of the differences may be that uhm you and Jan Aarts will do things to the highest standards of course 
and try to get uh results 
And what I would do would not be of course at the same level in any sense at all 
but would it be possible to consider uh li uh limiting the S E U and the Nijmegen contribution to the sentence grammar then I would do the text grammar part 
Probably I couldn't do it very well 
but it would be better than having no text grammar at all uh because we need in my view to have a functional specification of a text grammar so we can start to process in this case project uhm management texts through some software to make it more efficient 
but uh if I have uh some idea of what sentence grammar would be like then I can make a better stab at getting out a text grammar 
Well uh that 's again a problem uhm 
To start with what would be a sentence grammar 
I mean what sort of sentence grammar do you envisage 
Well it would we we which it would be one 
What sort of model are you thinking of 
Well I I 'm thinking basically of a subset of the Comprehensive Grammar that sort of statement on what sort of uh syntactical uh structures are in fact uh permissible within that uh domain and which ones are uh frequently used which ones create cognitive processing problems which ones are easily processed 
Ah that 's a different thing 
That 's a that 's got nothing to do with the grammar 
Well 
what 
a grammar of what is possible 
some things are simply not as likely as others so uh I suppose frequency would give some indication in a corpus of that sort of probability of occurrence 
uh but the question of efficiency is quite a different one 
Oh sure 
And so I would in that sense be engaged in uh contributing to the efficiency element of the grammar 
And I think that is very important uh for practical purposes and the sentence grammar that the S E U would do as I as I see it would be using the sort of classification insights and the interpretation and the general feeling for language which is the major contribution as I see it of the Survey to a uh to a sublanguage basically that language used in project project uh management 
And one would be looking to the S E U to use all of that you know experience looking at a looking at a parsed corpus and saying in this case what the sentence grammar what the as it were the descriptive sentence grammar was and I would come in with the efficiency aspect of the different constructions and I would contribute to it

Was it good 
Yeah 
and this 
Mm 
Yeah 
Mm mm 
So what sort o what sort of music do they play 
Uh Otis Redding stuff 
like punks and heavy metal 
Trying to get a band together 
There 's a soloist and drummer 
It 's a very good film though 
Mm 
Uh uhm 
Yeah 
You ought to go and see that actually 
Is that good 
Yes 
Is it all rap music 
Not really 
film 
It 's got 
It 's good actually 
It 's worth seeing 
Uhm 
Oh yes 
And what i wh what 's expensive 
That 's ridiculous 
The Ritzy in Brixton is four pounds 
And at Whiteleys if you go before five o'clock it 's three pounds 
Yeah well 
Miaow 
You can't get lower than that 
In the West End they s they usually do about four pounds if you go before five o'clock or something 
Like the Empire 
Uh uhm 
Royal Court uh last night 
Which one wa was that 
in uh Truly Madly Deeply 
Oh she 's good 
Saw her in uhm Truly Madly Deeply 
And uh it was very good 
Mm 
Mm 
I 'm going to see City Slickers on Wednesday 
It 's supposed to be uh rubbish 
You 're joking 
It 's had good reviews 
I think it looks brilliant 
I really like Billy Crystal and Bru Bruno Kerby as well 
He 's good 
Well you only know one person 
And I 'm I 'm looking forward to seeing it 
I like Bru 
Bruno Kerby was in Good Morning Vietnam 
Was he 
Have you seen that 
Yes I have 
Yes it was all right 
Uhm so what did you in your 
today 
which is 
How do you spell that 
S H double E P 
L E A S 
Uhm 
it 's north 
Sort of near Leatherhead 
No 
It 's West Horsley 
Uh uhm 
It 's chopping down birch trees 
But they 're quite thick so 
Mm 
They stop the light getting through 
Mm 
Through to what 
Oh yeah 
It 's a bi it 's a horrible tree 
What 
Birch trees 
We just g we just get rid of them 
And the hazel 's useful for hurdling 
d d nobody likes birch trees 
We had a lot of public through 
We have a money tin as well 
Mm 
where other people live 
Uhm 
Right 
So are they nice people in the group 
Mm very nice 
We 're having a bonfire party on Tuesday night 
Some nice boys 
There could be one or two nice boys 
Are you what you 're hav you 're having one on Tuesday 
At uhm one of the girls ' 
Well she 's not a girl 
She 's a girl to some 
Literally 
Uhm sh she 's got quite a small house a small garden a small 
Uhm whereabouts 
Whereabouts 
the fire the bonfire and 
Actually it 's not a small garden 
a small house though 
It 's big but it 's small 
N nice nice size garden that she really looks after 
Yes 
I 'm sure they 'll be tasty 
beefburgers and 
Cos we 'll get the barbecue going as well and toast marshmallows in the bonfire 
Mm 
vegetable grills you get at uh supermarkets 
crispy crumb outer coating 
How many do you get in a pack 
Six 
It 's about it 's about one pound fifty or something 
Uhm that 's an idea 
Ve very tasty 
Vegetable grills 
or couple of packets and just one mega-packet of beefburgers decent ones 
I 'll go to Marks 
Do Marks do vegetable grill 
Should do shouldn't they 
Uhm 
Their own sort I would imagine 
But uhm 
So what did you do today then 
called uh the Pembertons 
Mm 
Uh uhm 
Yes 
Pembertons 
Well I know uh 
Uh I 've only seen seen him perhaps mon month or something and I went 
Yeah Oliver 
Oliver Pemb Pemberton 
I used to go to s 
I went to school with Emma 
Didn't I go to school with their daughter 
Is there is there was there a girl there 
N 
Did I have 
Was there a sister there 
I don't know whether 
Yeah I suppose so but I heard that 
Emma 
Josephine 
he 's got somebody living in his house who 's who used to go to Mrs Parsons ' 
Oh he was a member of the bicycle polo club last year 
Oh right 
connected to the rear wheels 
Uhm 
Oh right 
And you just have a little stick and a 
It 's sort of 
Uhm 
Not a tennis ball just kind of hard ball 
And uh the bikes are short got a sh very the wheels are very close together so you can turn quickly 
So where d' you play this 
Oh that 's next to the Hurlingham Club itself is it 
Oh right 
So whe how often do you play 
But it 's now winter so we don't play any more because it gets dark too early 
and play s 
Yes but what we have what were we 
Oh yes you saw Oliver Pemberton 
What did you do yesterday 
I went and watched the rugby 
I was watching a bit of it in Kensington High Street when Blinkers had it on 
Yeah 
Uhm and then uhm went out to the theatre 
Right at the Royal Court yes 
No I I want to go and see the Alan Ayckbourn play 
Over two nights 
Is it over two nights 
Oh I didn't know that 
But you you don't you don't have to have to book up the same the following night 
You can book it up a week later or something 
You know you can book for one week and then 
But it 's it 's more cost effective to actually book both nights at the same time 
But it 's worth booking both at the same time so that cos it costs less I think 
But I shall 
Yeah 
Because Karen and I have been to see most of his plays 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Have you 
Uhm Invisible Frames is good 
Henceforward 
And there 's one at 
Karen Kappan 
And what 's she doing these days 
Where 's she working 
Where 
an industrial estate quite a smart one in East Molesley 
Wha what are they called 
Allied International 
just down the road from her so they often meet for lunch 
So they actually make furni furnishings do they or do they actually d just design 
Well just furnish companies I suppose I think Allied International 
She does everything there 
She 's got a share in the company and 
It 's a very small company 
She does everything 
He can afford to pay 
He 's rich 
Hopefully it will improve Neil a bit but I think he 's happier where he is now 
Has he got can he speak 
Yeah I mean he 's a pretty normal boy 
Poor chap 
and he 's just happier now where he is 
And mother 's over at the moment 
during the day 
During the day 
I 've got to get uhm Clare Greeton 's birthday present 
Do you know have you met Clare 
Clare Greeton 
Yeah 
B B C class 
Porsche 
Porsche 
Uhm ex-Porsche 
She sold that ages ago I think 
What has she got now 
Nothing 
Her boyfriend 's got a car so 
The boyfriend 
Mhm 
The coast 
They are going to uhm they 've bought a house 
they would buy it for about 
the baked beans tins 
and then return it and get half and get one pound back or something like that 
That 's how they do it 
Right 
or three thousand 
second hand books 
Mm 
She could have had all Dad all Daddy 's books 
in about three week 's time 
It 's her birthday so I 've got to try and find think about what to get her 
She 's got everything really 
I 've also made all the notes that I was going to on one of these sheets of paper 
Mhm 
you 've marked it have you 
Eh 
Have you made some notes 
Sorry 
I actually 
I actually made a note on eight periods 
Here we are 
I 've I 've actually got it 
Right 
five parts 
four parts of a solo which Guy is doing cos it 's easier to stick on later 
uh say three to four bars 
uhm whenever that happens uhm assuming that Guy is going to do the middle part which is mostly uhm that 's the bottom tenth 
uhm so that you know sort of what the tune is as it were 
so you can have some idea of how the chords are going 
uhm but basically that 's that 's what we 'll do 
uhm 
Yeah right 
Mhm 
Mhm 
Have you decided what to do with exercise number six 
When did you do that 
How many times did you do that 
A couple of times 
uhm the only time I think the only time was at the bottom of what 's called a hundred and thirty 
Yes 
Now that 's just marked sing whichever you can 
uhm 
I don't 
Do you think that 's what that bracket is 
No brackets usually indicate whether it 's tenor or bass 
Well it 's five isn't it 
Well it 's one pass 
it 's one pass isn't it 
And it 's splitting 
I suppose so if we have to 
If we have to 
Yes 
Yeah 
So you you go down to the bottom Timmy for C 
The B 
yes 
Yes 
Yeah 
Roger 
No 
I don't think so 
Let 's let 's try let 's try it like that initially because the point is the fifth is in the in the solo part anyway 
so 
Presumably they start in E flat 
uhm 
well it 's it 's 
Sorry A flat 
we miss out we should miss out the notes that are in the solo 
Exactly 
That 's right 
Aren't they 
So what does that mean 
The person that 's affected is me basically isn't it 
You would go 
Wa what is down there 
No you 're the top line 
I 'm the second ti I 'm second line down 
uh from the solo you mean or 
Can we take it can we take it from from there 
Sorry about this Roger 
Sorry about this 
What what about that 
Yeah I agree 
Sorry 
Right 
Right 
Sorry about this 
It 's all right 
You 're doing that wrong 
Right 
Yeah 
OK 
Yeah 
Yes 
Right 
OK 
Right 
OK 
What are we going to give ourselves to start this song 
It 's a sort of a peculiar chord isn't it 
Yeah 
All right 
Well yeah 
You pick it up and begin to sing on the chord 
Right 
OK 
Now 
The first 
The first 
Yeh 
uhm and it 's not quite as bad as it looks 
But it it says 
It 's the same sort of speed for that 
Doo doo doo doo 
A separate doo on each one 
uhm I think s I think so actually 
I think so 
All right 
All right 
OK 
we 've all got words 
Sorry 
Yes 
Well ultimately ultimately I think it 's going to be something like uhm pm pm pm pm pampam pam pam pam pam 
that kind of thing 
OK 
Hold it there 
Thank you 
Now then any problems you 've had so far 
A few cock ups on my part 
It 's ooo not doo the second time is it 
No 
It 's it it 'll it 'll be doos all the way through 
I 'd just like to do that again uhm basically for my s for my sake 
OK 
Right 
O K 
That sounded that sounds very very nice 
That sounds very very nice 
And nobody 's got any problems noteswise at all 
sounds like 
And so Roger we 're doing a we 're doing a we 're putting a a D on the front of each of these notes because I think it needs it really cos it 's a sort of 
Right 
uhm in this bit here this bit here I told you what kind of speed the thing will eventually go 
but I don't think we 're going to rehearse it at that speed for the moment 
I 'd like to do it at that kind of speed for the moment 
somebody 's got the words for the others 
I mean like you 've got them to start Tim 
and we haven't 
So we 're like accompanying there 
further on a and so on 
Because the watch out for them 
Don't be surprised when they happen 
be aware of three-or-four-words 
So what would that be 
from quite 
It 's you Gavin 
Oh yeah all right 
I was waiting 
I don't know what I was waiting for 
Same same same again 
Yeah 
Two three four 
Still pretty slow 
One 
Try try it again 
Right 
there will be a pause 
There will be a there will be quite a pause on that on that sheep 
Two three 
There 
What 's that 
Where 's that 
Sorry 
Do you want us to continue the note as well 
Have we got to that stage 
for the moment yes because it 's a nice chord 
But uh we 'll see about that 
You you all right Gavin 
Yeah 
Yeah 
More or less 
Good 
OK 
well in that case let 's take it from exactly the same place at where do they keep the little black sheep 
And this time we 'll go straight on 
last part of O one three one 
OK 
Let 's take it 
Thank you 
OK that this last line didn't sound quite right 
Shall we try and take it just for the second time from the second tone bar 
uhm 
Sorry 
It 's my fault as much as anybody else 's more than anybody else 's 
Right 
uhm let 's take it from there 
Still the same slow speed 
From the second tone bar 
My fault again 
could you just play it through so we know what it 's exact exactly cos I 'm not confident that I know what that it 's supposed to sound like 
It 's pretty 
It 's nice 
How does that sound to you 
Great 
Great stuff 
Great stuff 
Same same again just really for my benefit 
Same place 
Second tone bar 
Sorry 
Absolutely 
Oh what 
All right 
It 'll sound even better when you got Guy in there as well 
Yes 
It 's odd without the other extra man 
That 's uh 
Right 
OK 
No 
This is a little lie 
The next thing I have to do is have a drink of beer 
Right 
Now 
I reckon 
Yeah mhm 
six eight isn't it 
Yeah 
Eh 
That 's what it is 
Oh 
True 
Yes 
You 're right 
Well you 've done it 
Go on 
You take it 
And then a second wait on the pause on there 
Yeah 
Yes 
You sing it Roger 
No you you 're singing exactly right 
That 's exactly it 
And then it goes back into four but it 's in six eight for those two bars 
Right 
I suppose it 's supposed to be free tempo isn't it 
Sounds sounds funny to me 
I don't know 
It 's got be it 's got to sound as though it fits in somehow hasn't it 
unless it 's supposed to be a take-off or something 
uhm well it is 
It is in a way 
Is it is that about is that about right 
Do that again sorry 
Well no because you 're still doing it in four four time 
and it isn't 
I mean that 's not what 's there 
I mean you might want to do it like that but that isn't what they 've written 
Am I 
So have you managed to uhm land any more big uhm orders or something permanent 
No 
It 's very very very quiet at the moment 
I mean at somewhere like G C H Q then it would be worth it 
Yes they do 
Oh yes 
Because the lady opposite used to work in the canteen 
Mm 
Mm 
This is going to be a question of who you know not what you know 
That 's right 
So if you can work on that one 
from her it 's the end of information technology if you change things 
I knew I know the phone number of the chap uhm 
Yeah 
But what I need is a personal intro to him 
Yeah well I I 'll phone him up and work on him 
you can't 
Put in a good word because that that would be uhm ideal 
That 'd be too fantastic 
wrapped around roots and everything 
Yes 
Well only one charge for it 
uh uh did you disturb this broccoli 
Mm 
Uhm this park idea idea 's fascinating 
canteens needing well I 've really no idea two or three 
Well I must just push 
Remember there 's a twenty-four hour service there 
That place never closes 
go all the time 
yes 
Actually I 'll tell you who does uh open in fact 
But I can't remember if he still does 
lower in the high street 
Uh 
Mm 
So he he has a bit 
has grown 
Yeah 
this one as well well 
Oakley 
Oakley as well 
Mm 
We do not do that amongst greengrocers and chandlers 
We leave each other 's patches alone very firmly 
Does a bit mhm 
Very closed shop 
That 's it 
I i if they come to us and say we want to leave because we 're unhappy then we 'd take them on 
And and that applies to all of us 
but we none of us poach each other 's business 
Get black-legged 
No 
They don't just get blacklegged 
I mean it is the most incredible sort of Mafia thing that happens 
magic circle or whatever it is because there 's absolutely nothing said 
We don't have meetings or anything 
or whatever 
for something they 'll give it to you 
and you get generously 
And if you want to borrow something from somebody you pay costs 
Uhm and help 
Got really good Christmas trees this year 
It 'd be worth us all getting in on it 
Now that 's business for you 
We 've done it to three people I think so far 
Mm 
One of them we found nicking on the market 
Three people here have less 
There was one of them nicking on the market 
Wh what 's your name 
The Kray brothers 
No 
You may have a little trouble getting in 
I wonder why they don't use the label 
But I think they do 
I think he fancies it a bit 
Yes Terry 
hill 
Don't think it 's Te quite Terry 's scene 
Oh well I 'll talk to Terry 
As at the moment it is such a nightmare 
Oh come on 
in Gloucester 
I know 
I know 
I mean it sounds 
You see what what galls Alan is the fact that Terry is a greengrocer 
Mhm 
Well they were nearer 
That 's why 
Exactly 
to show your face 
No 
No no no 
it 
But who on earth would be seen in a Kitchen Garden Shop 
I mean I ask you 
You don't even call it the right by its right name 
Kitchen Garden Shop 
No 
It 's just The Kitchen Garden 
You always say it every way but the right way 
He does it deliberately I might say 
Mm 
Well The Garden Shop 
Yes 
That 's better 
The Weed Shop 
Yes 
Well that 's about right 
Grass shop is what it is 
Mm 
Is that what it is 
Yes 
Well 
you see 
he came home the other day 
that down on the market early in the morning 
d' you know what paper they look at these men 
No 
The Sun 
The Sport 
The Daily Sport 
So he was telling me you know what was in it 
So I said well bring them home 
you know of it 
He did bring it 
Oh he did 
He brought three copies not one 
I brought three copies 
things 
Mm 
Oh yes 
I don't know 
I mean it it really is 
I mean did you look at the crossword 
God I mean I mean can you can you quote a clue out of the crossword 
No I can't because I 'm bursting to spend a penny 
Go and spend a penny 
yeah yeah 
But I mean you know uh 
Well yes 
Oh yes 
I do yeah 
Well it 's it 's it 's just so base and and everything 
male abuse 
Yeah anyway 
I mean 
that 's the sort of level that it 's all right 
It 's a total take-off 
The whole thing is a take-off 
it can be amusing to look at once 
It was so funny 
And then he would say back to the girl 
And he said well obviously this girl it 's gotta be silicon chips 
Oh yeah 
I mean 
you can be sure 
basic corny ideas as well 
Most of us have minds like gutters anyway 
Yes 
they 're greengrocers aren't they 
Why have you got to have a dirty mind to be a greengrocer 
When you are dealing with cabbages and lettuces why have you got to have a dirty mind 
Melons 
Yeah 
Yes 
Well Will will tell me where that sort of shop is 
Oh yes 
He 's absolutely charming Will 
He 's lovely 
But I don't think 
He 's gay you see 
He really is gay 
You do 
I know you do 
You have 
You 've come home 
You haven't met Barbara Williams 
Or you wouldn't say things like that 
Mmm 
No 
Don't you see 
She is over seventy 
She is this size 
She weighs ten 
It doesn't matter 
Never mind the size feel the width or length or whatever 
Length 
and the neck begins 
quality 
Just a saying 
No 
Or something 
I 've never heard of that one 
Yes 
Yes 
That 's right 
Never mind the 
Never mind the quality feel the width 
Oh really 
No 
I don't want to go now 
No 
It 's gone off hasn't it 
Uh yes 
Because I 've been doing mind over matter you see 
the deaconess introduced you to Jean 
I am right in that aren't I 
I think so 
Yes 
Well it don't I I I I 'm almost certain I did 
Well your memory 's perf better than mine is you know 
B a at the ch at the church 
You and you were you knew this church 
and she was the deac 
and Jean came and and 
and I think that uh she 
Mm 
She actually introduced us 
I think so 
Yes 
Yes that 's right 
She didn't she didn't say keep away from this man 
but she said 
This is Mark 
Pity 
Whatever 
That was the first I 'd heard of him yes 
and do you remember my little house there and rooms I had 
We all sat round 
and you you got intrigued by the little rooms 
and you wrote me a letter about my little rooms in Ivy Bridge 
Uh uhm 
Did I 
Oh dear 
No No you did 
that 's very complimentary very very good 
When Louis was staying I stayed a week I think 
Yes 
You stayed there 
It was really marvellous 
I 've met him several times since Marjorie 
Oh 
Is it giving you pleasant memories or not 
Yes yes yes 
And if I remember rightly you had jaundice didn't you 
Trust him to stay longer 
I had had 
I was getting over it 
Yes that 's right 
I I It was that time 
But you went back and you had jaundice or something 
Uhm 
Y About then yes 
Uh uhm 
Or had I had it before 
I know I had it about then 
No 
You probably had it before 
I was probably looking a bit yellow still 
Yeah 
I didn't know whether you were Chinese or what you were when you came but still 
No no no no that 's that 's an exaggeration 
I didn't mean that no 
Uh I think you ha a got jaundice prior to that 
And as I say we 're talking about years ago 
That 's right yes yes 
No uh and have you got 
very well 
It 's an amazing memory 
And as we got down over the steps at stairs at Newton Abbot the train was just pulling out 
You had to get back to London or you were I don't know something 
you were teaching or doing something in London 
Uhm 
Uhm 
I know it was imperative you had to get back that morning that day 
And uh we just missed the train 
This seems unbel unbelievable but I did it 
Do you remember that 
Uhm 
Yes 
Uhm 
Uhm 
For the rest of the journey 
Yes 
Sounds like a James Bond chase 
We did 
Oh yes 
And she had to be back on duty that day 
But we left in the morning and I left with her very early 
And she had to be in at a certain time and I had to stop and get petrol 
That was in London 
Did this 
And then you drove back again 
Mum and Dad 
Mum 
she was very very ill 
And he rang and said that she was very ill and poor Flo all got very upset and had to see her 
I said right 
And we used to close our shop at nine o'clock at night and I said to Flo right we 'll see your mother 
And this is really really true 
Flo she she packed some clothes 
'n' closed our shop at nine o'clock in iv in Ivy Bridge in Fore Street 
And they lived in Pembroke Dock three hundred and twenty-five miles away 
Cos there was no Horse Ferry then up in place-name 
It was too early in the morning 
I had to go right around Chepstow and all that way down to get to Pembroke Dock 
Now I got into Pembroke Dock 
They lived adjacent to the dockyard there 
There 's a big dockyard clock and that clock was striking exactly nine o'clock when when we got there 
Amazing 
after being in my shop all day working 
I wasn't on the road then 
shop 
Uhm 
Uhm 
And that took a bit of diddin doing 
That was my big one of my biggest achievements I think to do that sort of thing 
Uhm 
Yes 
Well there was no tr there wasn't traffic on the road then 
It 's all about me isn't it today 
What am I talking about I 'm 
Uhm 
It 's your special day 
all the family are here since you 're here 
Yes 
Will you have another cup of tea grandpa 
No thank you sweetheart 
No I 've picked the sherry 
All right 
Why ha ha haven't you had a biscuit of some sort or something 
Sorry I 'm a bit vague 
are 
Thank you 
True 
Ah I 've got a pla there was a plate here for me 
I was going to say this hasn't been used here 
Thank you very much 
And now we 're s we 're sitting in a in a house on a piece of ground where you had kept ponies isn't it 
That corner 
Here 
Yes yes 
That is true Mark 
Miss Mahan at at the Perchester Road there 
his last serv service 
three-or-four-words baptists 
That 's good 
Uh there 's no one been appointed here yet but it will be about two months I think 
There 's a canon officiating here now am I right in saying that 
I don't go to church 
I know it 's Canon somebody 
On this in this 
Uhm 
Uh uhm 
Uh uhm 
Well I know somebody 's coming here in the meantime 
Yeah canon he is I think 
The vicarage 
The vicarage 
Yeah 
That 's right 
young Cochan the man that 's on he he 's he knows quite a bit about the church 
uhm local combine called the diocese dio dicey diocese 
parish church council 
or it may be it may be the diocese it may be the diocese that owns it I don't kn that would buy it 
I don't know 
They bo well they bought it for three hundred and fifty thousand pounds 
Uh uh 
Where is where is this 
but 
but what I was saying is the house that they 're working on now they had two spinster ladies lived there called Miss Mahon 
and that 's the one where I used to let my field go 
Yes 
Uh uhm 
All right 
Uh uhm 
Yeah uhm 
sh she 's name Terrace just across the way is a big gate where I used to go in with my pony 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Uhm 
How old were you then 
How old would you have been 
Eighteen yes 
And I was on board a ship six days after I was eighteen 
Uhm uhm 
and then so you were in the navy for 
Six and a half 
Six and a half years 
Uhm yes 
that 's in the that 's what I termed my school garden in there 
There used to be a school gardens there 
Mrs Collier said she 'd like to come down one day and uh get some knowledge of her husband Mark 
John Mark 
Mark her husband 's called 
John 's the one that does the training 
that 's right 
He had a stroke didn't he 
does the writing up about Blandford 
He 's only got he 's only got a smattering of knowledge of it really 
but they mention the names of the places streets and all that in Blandford crosses and all 
I only know them by by the old name 
Souwester Cross 
I never have 
you see 
and uh 
Uhm 
Yes 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Uhm 
They 're thinking of putting houses everywhere at the moment 
got the how the name of Duck Street originated and I told them 
I wasn't how did it 
It is called Duck Street now 
Yes 
Duck Street 
the family of Arne 
I 'm sorry three-or-four-words 
you see 
Then you you know that that th there used to be a stream of water in the gutter running down there perpetual 
it never stopped 
down by s by the the 
I 've got to use my hand to show it 
And that is how it originally was named as Duck Street 
How was that 
Uh uhm 
Yeah 
Uh uhm 
Uh uhm 
Yeah 
R really 
Yeah 
Big white Wyandotte ducks 
No uh Aylesbury ducks I should say 
Oh yeah 
So it 's still Duck Street is it 
Isn't it Andrew 
So it 's weak on that 
But it 's very good in terms of the way it stores the stores the data 
It 's very very efficient 
As efficient as you can get really 
Uh uhm 
Yeah 
I mean I haven't been able to test that 
but it would seem so because 
And also it 's good on uhm data space data space as well which when you 've got this much data you don't want loads of blanks floating around 
you 're not restricted in any way 
No 
It doesn't do compression 
So it 's safe in that way 
like with any database really 
I 'm pretty sure that it is actually 
I 'm pretty sure it is 
I think it is yeah 
we can ask them anyway 
But if you want to come up and see and see it sometime there 
You and Nick you and Nick 
when Andrew 's there perhaps or 
Uhm well I 'll I 'll be up there from December mid-December 
That 's what I 've been doing in the summer yeah 
you 're welcome to sort of adopt the things that we 've developed 
How how advanced is your database 
At least two and three 
advanced have they got 
Yeah 
to where it 's in the text 
Uhm it 's quite fast I think 
Yeah 
Uh uhm that 's understandable 
because under the language survey you see what I mean the language survey being a kind of scholarly enterprise 
programme within the language survey 
the whole uh site cost 
I 'll see what I can do anyway 
Well I I think it would be great for the it would be great for them 
No 
most most database manufacturers let you buy uhm I can't recall the words for it but they let you buy it so that you buy it once for a bit more the runtime version of it basically 
and then you can give everyone a runtime version of it 
And so I mean that 's 
like Omnus 
it 's usually quite expensive actually 
Well I mean I 've only ever done with P C dBase before but it 's not very expensive on P C dBase but I don't know what it 's like with Advanced Revelation 
Yeah 
Although with with the actual dBase it wasn't much extra really 
So 
Yeah with Omnus it 's in the thousands 
wasn't 
At least couple at least couple of thousand 
I think uh they 're they 're quite they 're quite decent decent lot actually 
There 're more made 
They sell more 
Yeah yeah 
Quite big 
Uhm 
Yeah 
I mean the advantages of being self-contained are clear 
if it is faster and so on 
Is that OK 
And that was just plugging it into the work station 
and actually do the project 
We 've got 
Well I mean they 're not even two eight sixes I think 
They 're they 're Tandon P Cs what what what was 
P C A Ts 
the possibility of portability to other operating systems I suppose in the future 
But I think I mean being realistic about it most people are in a P C DOS environment or an Apple environment in this sort of general world aren't they 
Yeah 
Uhm 
We 're putting a we 're putting a Novell network in that will run at will will we can link Apples and I B Ms to 
Why 
easily 
Well maybe 
Right 
No 
I mean so actually you know we 're we 're mainly I B M orientated 
Well is there very much that you can't do under DOS I mean given the fact that machines get much faster 
And the DOS impr DOS versions improve don't they 
No 
There 's a certain amount of academic snobbery attached to UNIX I always feel 
Yeah 
in terms of the market as well 
I mean everyone keeps saying oh UNIX UNIX UNIX 
Yeah but they 've been saying that for ten years 
I remember them saying that in nineteen eighty whatever 
a book machine programme 
Yeah 
flopped 
to uh 
Could 
But I 'd I would imagine that C U P would be a much more efficient way to do it 
Mm mm 
Yeah 
Uhm 
Yeah 
I mean either way you 've got the A-Rev data stored there 
Uh uhm 
which is the more efficient approach 
Uhm 
Yeah 
Yeah I mean definily definitely can 
I think A-Rev is coming out in a Windows version sometime actually 
Yeah 
I saw it yesterday 
You 've seen the software 
Yeah 
What 's it like 
Oh you saw it at that 
You went on that day did you 
Was that good 
early next year 
Uhm 
Right 
It is a Microsoft Windows environment 
Right 
So that gives you the possibility of font handling and that kind of thing I suppose 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Probably but I think it 's mostly character-based at the moment 
Right isn't it 
I think we might do as as it comes up 
I mean mean it makes sense mightn't it 
Yeah I mean it might be best 
Yeah I mean there 's quite a sort of overhead machine overhead on Windows isn't there but I mean you you 've got to have a big big powerful machine to run it or plenty of RAM 
At the same time it 's not going to have Windows then yeah 
A three eight six isn't it basically 
Just about 
I think it is where the fu where the world 's going 
Oh yeah 
Right 
Yeah 
Are you actually thinking of that as competition I mean in terms of serious you know serious commercial competition 
I guess that 's right 
It 's interesting isn't it 
Oh yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
No but I mean there are some other bells and whistle hiding in there 
Right 
Yeah 
Yeah 
that 's good 
this document 
Oh right 
Yeah 
or whatever it 's called 
Do you know 
I think there 's a deadline approaching 
so I thought it might be quite useful to talk cos like Sidney mentioned some possibility 
right 
significant one 
Right 
Right where did you put that 
Oh down at two here mm 
Right 
Your your end date on this is 
Do you have an end date 
Right 
Uhm 
Oh right 
Is that uhm item nine 
OK so it 's 
OK but are you using dBase at the moment 
What for 
So that 's held in dBase files is it 
Oh I see 
No I mean you know I 've done 
efficient storage-wise as I said 
I mean it 's just 
I mean I haven't any data to compare the speed or efficiency of them or how much work it is to debug them 
far safer than dBase on network systems 
Uhm dBase has got a very bad reputation or did have a mild uhm bad reputation indeed uhm for network systems in that everybody got a stand a stand alone package 
Yeah uhm it 's just it hasn't got a good reputation 
caused major problems 
I don't know what the current state of play is on dBase 
dBase four 
Uhm yes it is a possibility 
I think Advanced Revelation is safer 
but dBase four is more widely available actually 
but some classes of people 
if you 're doing it in runtime by the way it does not it doesn't actually matter 
more efficient 
because it came from Pick 
Your basic corpus searching and corpus indexing that 's done in C plus plus isn't it 
Yeah 
uhm and we 're getting plugged into that to a larger extent now 
There seems to be a sort of wave of interest 
presumably there is some kind of notion of a standard format for the data 
I don't know what it 's based on though 
I think there are various people using various formats 
So the person calling is being charged thirty-eight pence a minute 
Yes 
And the person who 's being called 
Who 's being called is charged a quid 
I mean people 
It still sounds bloody ridiculous 
days have you got at work out at their place 
things here and things there and all sorts 
We got our Christmas dinner and dance next Saturday at the Sir Christopher Wren 's house in Deaton 
Is that free 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Is it 
Have you got to pay for Betty to go 
No 
No 
if I want Betty to go 
Yeah 
Oh yeah 
I bet she doesn't tell me she 's coming to your Christmas do 
it 's going to cost me twenty quid 
Really 
Oh crikey 
Yeah 
I want to go cos it 's free but you got to pay for your spouse 
He 's stingy all right isn't he 
Would be a bit of a bad deal wouldn't it 
Yeah 
So effectively you 'll be paying ten pounds each 
Yes 
And then it 's like we 've got in what a week or two weeks is it 
I 've got that one that week 
I 've got the uh coming dinner and dance on a a Wednesday or something Wednesday night 
outing out for lunch 
I shall spend something about I don't know I think he actually spends two weeks I shall something about eight days consecutive days 
Dinners everywhere 
I just can't afford it 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Oh you have to pay for these 
Well like yes 
There 's only the the official company dinner 
The rest is organised by people in the department 
Right and 
Oh right 
And you pay for it 
And what do you get for this sort at Christmas 
I was in different work groups 
I mean Christmas dinners 
and then there are the cross-sections between a group and a group that threatens them 
Perhaps you should have done 
Can't afford it 
And like being the first first year you 've actually had a Christmas there 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Oh I see 
Yeah 
Exactly 
Hey 
departmental dinner 
Why 
What 
Why 
Oh sorry 
I thought you were talking about the R A F 
No 
I mean I 've had to do that as well 
Oh yeah I got mixed up 
I could toast the Queen and you know say thank you to all the V I P guests Air Air Chief Marshal X and what have you 
What for 
Yeah 
Cos I mean there was Air Chief Marshal X and then there 's uh Air Marshal Z and uh 
What 
Who were you then 
Who am I 
Yeah 
Cadet Pilot 
Oh great 
Hey listen 
We 've got to uhm go and see the old vic uh the Victors 
Why 
And take their mail round 
pay cheques in 
And pay the cheques 
Oh is that when it 's due 
Yes 
Yes 
Twenty-third is that 
Twenty-third Saturday 
Yeah 
Mm 
I could do without that 
another cheque for four hundred pounds 
Also we 've got to do the neighbours cos it 's just getting closer and closer 
Well I don't think we should now 
I think it 's too late 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I think that now it 's a bit too much like it 's too 
we 're having it whether you disapprove or not 
Or not 
Yeah 
Oh yeah 
Yeah 
Warn them 
You should be forewarned 
Yeah 
It 's still better to go and tell them 
Tell them 
Yeah 
It is 
Because I know what it 's likely to call the police round 
They should be forewarned 
Yes 
He Here you are 
I was going to ask 
This is great this 
cover on 
Me and Matt 
With drawing pins 
There were about half a dozen already on there 
bits and pieces off 
What a mess 
It It was all 
in by drawing pins 
but they 'd all come loose 
Yeah 
They had blankets 
Silly sod 
because they 're having a party 
We 'll do it on Saturday and get it out of the way 
Yeah 
Tomorrow 
Tomorrow 
Tomorrow 
Yeah 
We 've been saying tomorrow since since last week 
No 
Don't put off till tomorrow what you can do today 
Yeah 
Well my my one is the opposite 
Yeah 
Exactly 
Me too 
Uhm right 
Right 
We 'll get that out the way tomorrow 
Yeah 
vodka 
Yeah 
It could just get nicked 
No 
I haven't thought of it yet 
What are we talking about 
some TV then 
At least if we 've got some beer we can say right 
Well we 've got some beer 
You can buy it off us 
But a lot like Mike 's like quite a trustworthy guy and might just like let us drink it all afterwards 
If you wanted to give him six quid you did 
All right 
Yeah 
I think that 's a good idea 
say yeah we got a crate 
you can have it off us for twelve quid you know 
I 
I 
Yeah 
So you want to find a wholesale place then 
Uh yes 
I 'm telling you that we don't want to be bothered to go further than Ealing Broadway on Saturday 
Are you going to drive us there 
On Saturday 
I am going in to town on Saturday 
Yes 
And me 
What town 
Shopping 
Yeah 
London town 
Yeah 
Well I don't know 
Well I am not going to do all the furniture rubbish myself 
Everyone 's Everyone 's buying a futon 
People are arriving about well dinner time 
Everyone 's arriving early 
Before lunchtime 
I tell you what 
I 'm not going to have a repeat 
What lunchtime 
in the afternoon 
Etc 
Yeah 
We 'll go in the morning then 
Some Some people are 
Yeah 
We 've got to clear the whole house out for starters 
And I 'm not doing it myself 
If no one 's in sod it 's all going to stay as it is 
Yeah 
That 's true 
I think my mum 's coming 
I 'll give that 
Eh 
My mum 's coming 
To the party 
Good stuff 
She is 
She actually said she was gonna going to 
Oh right 
Mm 
Is 
Is 
Bob 's coming 
Yeah 
Sime 
Sime 
Yeah 
Martin 
Richard 
Loads of people are coming 
in the hope that she 'll finish with me 
Who 
Martin 
Well that 's what you have to live with when you do it 
The paranoia 
Yeah although 
You 'd better not let Jo get hold of this 
That 's right 
Yeah 
You see 
Nick could find a fork in his neck 
I haven't because this is not my tape 
This is 
Oh right 
Anyway less of talk of infidelity 
Who is talking of infidelity 
keeping hamsters 
Gee I tell you Peter 's got you by the short and curlies 
She really has 
Yeah 
She has 
Yeah 
Totally 
You didn't think of that did you 
You 'd better be nice to her 
Yeah 
Yeah 
something fantastic 
I am taking her out down the West End next week 
because I start work on Thursday 
Work 
Yeah 
she is 
She 's taken a day off work 
No 
She 's coming down 
Yes 
doesn't have to come down because he 's already here 
He lives here 
her just like it is in Fatal Attraction 
Right 
his life has to 
Yes I know 
Mm 
He 's at home 
plays at a ballet class and get eight gets eight pounds an hour and he 
Mm quite 
Mm mm 
Mm mm 
Mm oh dear 
Yes mm 
And Sue how is it in Muswell Hill 
Well Muswell Hill itself I cn can't say I 've really uhm explored got to know uhm worked out at all 
Do you have one of those houses with a view 
It no it doesn't 
Oh 
and 
And so the sun comes in 
yes mm 
Right 
So it 's not g gloomy dark and depressing 
No 
It 's a lovely house 
Good 
So that 's very nice 
And we 've been uhm concentrating on uhm trying to get i it organised 
And how 're the children Andy 
The children 
Oh 
Well I don't think happy 
Uhm at least Dick seems to be more or less OK 
Uhm and Nell 's completely anti and uhm has decided that she 's going to be with Bernard 
holding down his job uhm and running a house and running children 
And I mean you have to be a pretty efficient manager of time to do that and that 's not really Bernard 's strong point 
And he also I think wants time and space to himself to sort himself out 
Absolutely 
he 'll have to think about who will look after Nell when she gets home from school 
providing her 
How old is Nell now 
Oh Sue 
So I think that 's something I uh just have to you know sit back and weather more or less 
sort of 
You see it is very hard for her to have a sexual relationship going on in the same house at that age 
I mean that 's why Chris and I were so lucky because the children were much younger 
I mean you know it is in that respect a very difficult age 
Mm mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Yes 
Yeah 
But it must 
Uhm although we kiss sometimes in public so to speak 
honestly the lengths we go to 
we n never lock the bedroom door because we never have because we think it 's a bit scary 
You see even fifteen would be better 
Mm 
Mm mm mm 
Mm mm 
Mm mm 
Mm 
Quite 
Mm mm 
Mm 
Mm mm 
Mm 
Mm mm 
Well yes 
you know 
of children anyhow 
You mean even if you and Bernard had stayed together 
you know had endless hormones and glands problems 
No 
Yes you might 
She might have been that kind of teenager anyway 
So 
Mm 
Quite likely I think 
you know 
Bolshie 
Yes 
And and also apt to take you know very completely irrational hates against people for what I think were probably sexual reasons 
Mm 
Yeah 
Well not always 
You might be like me 
I don't think in my case it was sexual 
But I have such a thin skin I 'm always terribly easily hurt 
as much as sexual 
Mm 
Mm mm 
Yes yes 
You know 
Yes W I it 's quite possibly that too yes 
She may be thin-skinned 
Mm 
And just because you 're her mother doesn't 
Mm 
Oh I think there 's a lot of that 
at in an at that kind of relationship 
you know they they need a sort of cementing bond of a child 
and that 's her role 
Mm 
And that 's very rational 
Mm 
That 's a very good question 
Because why can't you consult a psychiatrist and see wha I mean a friendly one and see what the correct response is 
Because it seems such a rational thing to say 
What 's the answer for her 
I could ask somebody 
what would you make of that 
Mm 
uh as far uh 
I mean she won't see a psychiatrist at all anything remotely approaching that uhm 
No no 
But you could ask someone 
Mm 
ever really love her and that when Dick came along 
I mean this this was all bound up with you know Dick coming along 
But why should she feel that because other people have second children 
Yes I know 
but I think you know 
I think it is a difficult thing and if it isn't got over properly I think can leave a lasting problem 
unnaturally so 
I think we should have you know done a bit of digging at that point sort of you know make her feel particularly special and find out if she was feeling at all bothered about it or whether she thought she had to be nice to this child because again she was earning her place 
Already she was earning her place 
And uhm you know while Dickon now can sort of you know say I want this I want that I don't like this I don't like that and he may not get what he wants out of it but at least he feels he can I think she feels too threatened to 
uhm you know mak making my life happy then I don't really want her 
And clearly I 've got what I need to make my life happy 
so she can't see a place for herself 
Yes 
Well you see I mean rationally she 's got a point 
I mean what do you do 
Mm mm 
Mm mm 
So again what do you do about it 
What do you do 
which at the moment is difficult because it 's it means sort of saying things like uh let 's go and buy you a new coat or let 's go and have a shopping expedition just see what we can find or let 's go to a film or something like that and kissing her 
Well 
Mm 
And what about uhm holidays 
Just you and her 
would she do that 
Uhm well I su suggested that but she she didn't want to 
And and somebody else said well maybe that was a bit of a mouthful and you know try just an evening on your own together 
Like skiing or something 
Or a day trip 
Yeah 
Does she feel excluded because you don't exactly confide in her 
I don't 
uh I haven't 
and I 'm I 'm rather scared that you know that would seem rather artificial to her and as an attempt to win her over 
uhm 
But you could start slowly 
But I agree it 's very difficult if you never have 
virtually nil 
Well I think uh yes I mean I think it will 
start in on straight away 
Uhm uhm 
Really 
Uhm 
Many many years ago we were interested in it 
One loses interest in everything when one has children 
Do you mind 
Uhm ooh 
my stubble 
put your feet up on me 
Pardon 
If you didn't put your feet up on me 
This goes back to this is going back a long way 
Oh dear 
Well there was Mummy being so embarrassed because Jane 's feet were on the table 
Jane was one 
No 
Ah well they 're lovely little feet 
I 'm sure 
How how did I manage that 
I was at a high table and I had my feet 
No no she you were in Mum 's lap and you used to put your feet on which is completely normal 
I don't think you were even slightly embarrassed about that 
Yeah 
It 's a funny thought isn't it that I was embarrassed 
Where was that 
Oh in Adelaide of course 
Only in Church Terrace would I be embarrassed 
Oh right 
Oh yes 
We were over on our holidays 
Ah there 's an ant 
So what 
Well catch it 
Well put him outside 
Look 
he 's on the toaster 
then brush him out 
Well I remember killing an insect in that train in India 
I know I 've never forgotten it actually 
Killing a what 
Killing an insect on the train in India 
Mmm uproar 
Extraordinary uproar yeah 
Mmm 
What from me 
yeah 
We were travelling in January 
Woops 
Was Dad then cast to the outer reaches of Hell 
No it was wonderful 
We were travelling 
oh we 'd just left the Ashram actually 
third class 
very important people 
You wouldn't normally would you Dad 
You don't even swat flies now do you 
No daddy 's a Jain 
Card carrying 
Do you sweep the floor before your before you walk on it so you don't tread on any ants 
Now how did you know that 
That 's right yes 
Ah that 's my Thomas Mann coming into it into it 
Whoa 
How can you possibly know that 
Not a common known known common 
These uhm what is it ascetics or something 
Commonly known fact among English women 
Uhm you know they they sweep the ground before them and they uhm 
And what else do they do 
Oh they they they go out in the cold with no clothes on or something 
Not even a turban 
What 's that 
they go out in the cold with no whats on 
In their birthday suits 
That doesn't prove anything 
And they what 's 
They they they uhm have fire and everything and they burn themselves a lot and they 
Now come on 
be more precise Jane come on 
What what 
Uhm 
They 'd need to after being out in the cold 
They do they really they really make their bodies uhm suffer don't they 
Uhm 
we 're talking about 
These these people in uhm India 
They 're foreigners 
Oh don't be so mean 
You 're so mean 
A legend 
Right now 
Some the southern peop the southern Tamils 
The Tamils of southern India 
Yes all right but in this legend 
It 's uhm it 's it 's called 
Actually it 's been made into a play 
Have you heard about it 
At the uhm The Transposed Heads 
No I didn't 
Oh it 's really good 
Who 's Thomas Mann anyway 
I 'm showing my ignorance 
He wrote Death in Venice 
So who is he 
And The Magic Mountain 
What nationality is he 
German 
Kraut 
But he he wrote this story called The Transposed Heads 
Yes a Kraut 
And uhm it 's a really good story actually 
Is he modern 
Mmm 
And so what 's he doing writing about India 
He deals with these themes and it was a way of dealing with the themes of duality and everything 
And of course The Transposed Heads means 
Are you sure it 's in India anyway 
Oh oh I 've read I 've just bought a book called Doubles 
You might be interested in it 
It 's about the double in history 
Yeah yeah 
About the doppelganger 
and all that 
Probably 
Well I 'll give it to you 
I 'll give it to you 
Anyway uhm 
Yes indeed 
What 
Daddy and I had a very funny experience with this 
Daddy c walked in the door one morning walked in this door I 
and I just read out a read a book review in The Times that morning and 
and Dad hadn't looked at the newspaper 
met his own image walking in the garden 
Isn't that right 
and I don't know where it 's from 
Now that 's spooky 
Mmm 
Mmm 
Well he read it the previous day in The Times didn't he 
He didn't 
No no no it was that morning 's book review 
No it 's Shelley 
It was Shelley 
He he quoted it didn't he 
It 's Shelley yes 
And it 's also in Charles Williams 
Oh well 
But it 's nevertheless very strange 
Odd 
Mmm 
Well it happened this morning 
Pip phoned me last week 
Also he phoned me wanting your address 
or was that 
Oh that was someone else 
That was Julian 
Julian 
Julian 's doing very well 
He 's s soloing now 
Was it Julian 
Is he 
Where 
Well Doncaster uh Concert Hall one place and uh he was going to go to 
I don't think he 's at Edinburgh this year 
Really 
What sort of songs does he sing 
Does he sing lieder or something 
Something like that 
Songs that baritones sing 
Oh he 's a baritone 
Are you employed in a job like that 
I mean does he sing 
He 's a schoolteacher 
Well that 's what I thought yes 
I was suggesting 
and the choir 
Oh yes quite 
Ah yes yes 
Mmm 
does a choir have a gig 
Did the Baroque Singers 
I don't know 
I 'm afraid I really don't know 
Must give us a ring 
Rock and roll 
Do you ever sing 
Has he got a nice voice 
Yes it sounds quite nice 
Mmm 
Uh well his uhm music teach teacher 
Well I mean I think as I say I 'm only going by what Julian said 
What an idea you 've got 
his teacher said that they 'll never find a more more beautiful voice 
More beautiful 
Has he got 
To the exclusion of everything else 
Have you met Julian 
We have to cough up the air fare but I don't know when 
Three hundred pounds 
Where 
Three what 
Bet he doesn't go 
Raymond 
Did you meet Raymond 
But Mum one 's in Austria OK 
Now 
Yes it 's funny 
I don't know what it is 
I have an Amsterdam and Antwerp problem as well 
Oh dear 
A what 
Amsterdam and and Antwerp 
We nearly got on a Venice plane going to going to Vienna anyway 
Yes it 's a problem 
John 
It may mean he 's not normal 
Mmm but then but actually we have disci discovered that everybody 's called John 
Not your generation 
I 've got a lot of Julians in my class 
Generation 
main ones 
The chaps around forty to forty-five are all called John 
exceptions 
But I mean lots of them 
I have a friend John who 's in Linguistics with me 
That 's the only John I know 
Well there are probably more 
And before you came here I think you took a course 
was it uh at a at a Polytechnic in Wales 
is that right 
Yeah 
I started it 
had a bit of trouble though with the natives 
so one term 
Right 
Oh not the Welsh was it 
Was that Philosophy or something else 
That was Humanities 
a wide range of others 
and it might have been a good degree 
but it wasn't uh 
Yes 
Not what you 
Not what I wanted to do 
you 're comfortable with in this one 
And that 's good 
and of course it has a connection hasn't it with University College 
and it was ever s 
Did there ever seem to be much of a connection between the school and the 
Mhm 
No there 's not particularly no 
wanted to go afterwards 
No I see 
Sure 
Didn't make a big thing when we went down there yeah 
you know when people come from schools to check out the place once a year 
Yes 
Mhm 
Fine good 
Doesn't give one skill like many of the courses here 
Mm 
Well it 's not vocational 
that 's right 
But the creative side 's the one you 're you 're you 're you 're working on and keen on 
yeah and also or possibly musician 
you 're involved with that 
Mm Mm 
Yeah 
And is that where you where the teaching came in 
Because many do write while they teach or do other things 
Was it uh 
Richard Adams was in the Civil Service as a lawyer and and he suddenly wrote Watership Down and then he was able to leave 
Yeah 
T S 
T S Yeah I 'm sure 
Lloyds Bank someone once told me 
So you 're ticking on the writing side possibly the music 
But how much have you got let 's say in the music side 
That 's right 
Is that right uhu 
Mm 
Yeah 
And uh so 
rejected from a record company 
to work with and at the moment don't 
particularly 
Right 
And was it it 's singing and playing 
There is uhm 
I wan I want I want to take singing lessons but I 'm not a particularly good singer 
appeals from that point of view to to actually hear them done well 
Mm right 
But that 's 
yeah you got to 
training or whatever 
And probably even when one 's writing songs and polishing up the way you 'd use the idioms and all that cos it 's going to be part of it 
Mhm 
Mm 
any 
I 'm thinking of song writing and any 
I know that with authors there 's uh something called the Society of Authors which is more for writing and publishing articles and publishing and that sort of thing 
sort of group of people 
Mhm 
Yeah 
I I really don't know I mean 
would approach th those sort of things would be just to do them as an interest as a hobby 
and uhm if they if you got somewhere then that 's great 
but n not to sort of pin too much on it 
No no 
and straight up to the top 
Make too much of a thing of it yeah 
Uh that 's sort of lack of confidence you know so 
Right 
I 'm just sort of looking 
There 's very sometimes I was surprised 
in Floodlight you can get the most outlandish and interesting courses in areas you never think of 
half a dozen courses in solo singing 
but I don't think 
That 's just classical stuff 
You can never know you might 
That 's right 
Mm 
Writing production workshop which uh which is under music 
There 's uh one course there 
I don't know 
about two pa pages 
Or music-related 
that sort of thing 
But you 'd probably know that music scene much better than I would 
heavy just like 
Yeah timing 's important because usually they start mid September going through for the year evenings 
But uh on the other hand when Floodlight comes out usually late July early August it 's worth looking out looking down the thing 
and if one says right could be around next year in London or wherever 
investigating those 
They come out late July August 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
uh 
some 
uhm where 's all the bit on music 
Certificate in harmony and counterpoint 
Well that sounds a bit formal 
and something on the twentieth century 
and might be of interest 
deals where there 's uh a lot of money in it for a very few that uh 
Oh yes 
I suppose have something very special to offer 
Exactly 
Yeah 
Not really worth pinning too much on it 
but so you could but the important thing so that also whatever you do has a gives you enough time to do that instead of being a busy yuppy working like a doctor hundred and twenty something hours a week or whatever 
but teaching is one that you 've looked at and feel could be a possibility 
yes exactly 
Mhm 
Right right 
Mhm 
and there 's a certain amount of people who want to teach it at whatever level 
it would have to be something else 
you know just general primary stuff 
not 
Mm mm mm 
Yeah 
Yes 
A a and more likely I suppose primary because your first degree has got to relate pretty closely if you 're going to get on a course in most cases 
mhm 
It 's going to be tight uh 
I 'd say possibly near to not not entirely ruled out 
say in if say you wanted to do a course in London at say the Institute of Education or at uh uh uh uh uh King 's or wherever 
Because the each course has 
They 've got a bit of discretion 
On the other hand there are these there are rules 
in the degree subject 
Check it out 
and uh if you if you could show them there 's enough in what you 've studied within your course that would relate to literature and maths and and whatever 's taught you might just squeak in 
But I suspect primary might be more likely 
But then you 'd have to think would I like to work with that age range 
That 's another thought 
And also in any area of teaching you look for uhm any experience you 've had with the relevant age range 
working with youth or community work or some sort of relevant age group 
it 's a half thing that might come into 
Oh and certainly use the time to visit schools different sorts different schools 
Sit in on classes 
Yeah 
Mhm 
Mm 
Mhm 
Mhm 
Mhm 
is that I was off I worked for three years before coming back to college 
And uhm I think that the time for taking years out is really gone and uhm would want to go straight into some sort of training after 
Right sure 
Right 
that you 're here for 
Building and Environmental Studies 
Yeah yeah 
that section 
It was architecture was it 
that you did 
Yeah 
The main course yeah that 's right yeah 
I mean did you decide at that stage to continue in architecture 
No not really 
thinking that uhm I 'd sort of do the full seven years and stuff 
but like I 'm just going through the course 
And uh you just kind of like get a a few hints at what actually working in the profession 's like 
which is like an an office with with you know people with drawing boards and stuff like that 
So no 
Mm 
Mm 
Mhm 
Mm 
Mm 
So you decided that you didn't want to pursue that further as a profession 
Not really 
No 
I found I found the degree really interesting 
It 's a great degree because it 's actually quite kind of mind expanding 
lots of levels not just like learning knowledge but playing with things 
and your mind was creative as well 
yeah 
Yes 
That 's right 
Yeah I was there for one year 
What What were you doing there 
I was doing Town Planning 
And was that straight from school 
Yeah 
Yeah that was yeah 
so I just went up there and and didn't really enjoy the course and decided that I wanted to do something 
Mhm 
So it was the course that wasn't 
It was the course 
It was a kind of combination of things really 
I didn't really know the uni the the sort of scene at university 
it 's quite quite impersonal and being in halls and stuff like that at the college with two thousand people 
But no it 's a lot to do with the course as well 
sort of battery educated if you like 
thinking for myself about my life 
And I actually decided that because I 'd always been sort of like told by teachers ah you 're good at this you should do this and you should do this as well because I was always really good at science and stuff like that 
And actually I 'm more interested in in in doing creative things than actually in science 
Yes 
I know yeah 
Mhm 
Yes 
Yes 
Mm 
Mhm 
Mm 
Oh right 
what made you decide to then go into the Architecture 
Yeah 
well it was kind of a related field 
of the general course which is Architecture Planning Building blah blah 
I started doing that route 
And one of the one of the des one of the electives 
I was doing this actually kind of Design elective which is no not the main the main crux of the Architecture course 
Mm 
and I just decided that that 's what I wanted to do 
So I just switched 
in the Bartlett 
Yes 
Did you 
Right 
Yes 
Mm 
Mhm 
Right 
So when you switched yes 
In the Bartlett 
Yeah 
did you initially think that you wanted to go into that as a career or were you doing it just as a degree because you en enjoyed the subject 
Pretty much yeah I 've got to admit 
I was really interested in that 
you see 
had hadn't produced anything kind of thing 
So I wouldn't admit I I knew in my mind that it was it was going to be difficult to do it under two years ' study 
yeah a bit much uh I was quite I was quite kind of like theoretical about it 
And I thought I 'm enjoying doing these non-stop learning things 
And it doesn't really matter if there is any particular career about at the end of it which I think lots of people think when they go to university 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah mm 
Yeah 
mm 
Mm mm 
Mm 
Right 
Yeah 
Yeah 
You don't know enough 
Yeah 
did you have any thoughts at that stage as to what you wanted to do upon graduating 
Yeah 
uhm 
projects 
no no pretty much 
I still I Well I mean I still don't really know exactly what I want to do 
Mm 
Yeah yeah 
Did you apply for anything in the final year 
Apply for 
Any jobs 
No no 
A And uhm I was actually kind of relishing actually sort of getting to June and and just getting free and just thinking I 'll get a job in a shop 
and I 'll I 'll sort of uh live in a council flat quite into the idea of that of just actually getting out of the whole scene and becoming a real person kind of thing and just working in a chip shop or something like that 
you just can't do it 
Mm 
Right 
Yes yeah 
Yeah mm 
Mm mm 
Mm 
Mhm mm 
when did because you said I think coming up the stairs that that you 've been applying for lots of different jobs 
when did you start that 
Mm 
I mean 
Yeah 
Ju July or August or something like that I think 
Yeah 
And I 've been applying quite quite regularly since 
I 've been really really sort of working at it every day 
Because you haven't got anything else to do you you just have to do it 
Yeah yeah just recover yeah 
So what kind of jobs had you mainly been applying for 
Well I started off applying for jobs that I was kind of like i in architecture really just the sort of jobs that basically just to earn just to earn some money i i in something that I could perhaps become quite proficient at 
is pretty grim 
You know what it 's like 
Just no jobs 
you know lots of them haven't got jobs 
Yeah mhm 
Mhm 
Mm 
Mm 
mm 
I know 
Property construction 's been really badly hit yeah 
I 've done a bit of writing before 
I 've done a bit of free-lance writing for for various for music papers and stuff like that 
Mm mm uhm 
And also gen generally things that kind of like combined combined creativs creativity with more mundane things like administration and stuff like that 
Arts administration 
I 'm not really sure what it uh completely entails or anything like that 
basically anything that 's in The Guardian on on on Monday 
Mm 
Yeah 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Yeah 
Yeah mhm 
Mm 
yeah 
how many jobs do you do you think you 've applied for 
I 've applied for a lot actually 
I 've got a lot 
about I 'd say about forty or fifty or something like that about 
Ten fifteen more 
Yeah 
Yeah 
And have you had any interviews 
one interview which was for a a a a a shop job in Bond Street which was 
It was just kind of a job I wasn't really interested in doing anyway so 
really wanted to take 
Right 
Mm 
mm 
Mm mm 
And of those forty or so jobs you 've applied for have they mainly been in response to vacancies that you 've seen advertised 
which uh I just kind sent out loads of blind things you know to all the to all the firms and stuff like that like you do you know to see if they had any places 
Right right 
Yeah 
Yeah yeah 
right 
mm 
And you said you were looking in the Guardian uhm on Monday obviously 
Yeah yeah 
Where else do you look John 
Well uhm just looking 
That 's really kind of uh quite specific really cos they have a certain sort of job and that 
That 's your main source 
That is pretty much and on Saturday as well and on the Independent on Wednesday and those sort of things you know 
Also in Also in the Standard I 've been looking quite a bit 
I 've been just for general jobs you know cos they sometimes have quite interesting things there uhm 
Yeah 
Mmm 
Mhm 
Mmm 
Yeah 
Yeah 
How can I best help you over your careers advice 
Uh well I haven't looked into the area very much 
uhm sort of what options are available 
about sort of jobs or other possible courses that are that way orientated 
and also I 'd be very interested in travelling and working abroad if possible 
Yes 
Yes 
Right 
uhm 
Mm 
Is that the Tefl sort of thing 
That 's a Tefl or teaching in English in Japan uh the the JET scheme 
JET scheme 
uhm 
And you go for a year 
on the other hand lots of people who go say how much they have enjoyed it 
And they do uh respond and blossom as a result 
we can find out details about that and just what 's involved and how you go about applying 
It is quite popular of course 
Mm 
Oh yeah 
Mhm 
Mhm 
Do you need to be qualified don't you teaching English 
You don't 
Uhm I would have to check that from the literature 
but that 's certainly one way of getting getting around the world uh and being paid 
Uhm and there are various places where you can do that 
Yeah 
Right 
That 's very expensive isn't it doing it 
The other thing you could do is is is is is do something for money here for a number of months and then blow it on you know row around the world or whatever for the next six months 
Yes 
Like the When we had the talk on clinical psychology and stuff you know you need a lot of experience not just with people with problems and stuff 
uh as a volunteer if not as a paid 
I can't find them anywhere for the minute 
some hands-on experience 
uhm 
Right 
really 
No what 's 
Or are you at uh at the beginning of the sort of job search 
I don't think so no 
This term 
looking through that 
Uhm there are two or three probably that that 're of interest 
in there 
This one in terms of health in the private area talks more about uh uh uh psychoanalysis 
might be worth looking at 
Looks quite impressive doesn't it 
Mhm 
Oh right 
Right 
It doesn't appeal so much 
It doesn't 
OK 
quite interesting 
here in in London 
Uhm in clinical psychology sort of thing 
Oh we 've had lectures on it and stuff 
Yeah 
Uhm uhm is there a possibility if I express an interest 
I mean you can do the two things in parallel 
You can always say look this is to be preferred 
and I 'm I 'm not sure how how funding would be applied in in your case 
There may be the odd scholarship 
Yeah 
Because they don't come cheaply 
Right 
Yeah 
yeah 
Uhm 
Is this for fees or for 
Yeah 
quite of bit it 's preferable to have quite a bit of experience don't you think 
Yes yes 
so you 've got more to bring to the course 
against which to relate 
Mm 
Right 
Mm 
No 
for two reasons 
I 've only just transferred into the uh Careers Service uhm 
and I haven't yet had a programme to take me into those areas that have uh asked for particular details 
uh and your background look at one two three 
Mm 
Right 
Mm 
Mm 
that uh sort of are related to them 
uhm which will give you the first lead on that 
uh on the ground floor 
So if you if you will go downstairs and then you could look through these two postgraduate guides 
Uhm and then I 'll show you where the others are 
Probably you won't want to go down and look at that today 
what the structure is 
there may be some sort of reference to it 
Mm 
Right 
Mm 
Mm 
mhm 
Yeah 
Uhm well we 've only just sort of started a course in that 
At the moment it doesn't appeal so much 
uhm sort of short placements and things like that in that area 
but I don't think I 'd like to do a course in that now 
Yeah 
you could be looked looked up under 
Mm 
uhm 
that you might want to use and think about for for career purposes 
Uhm 
Yeah 
What do you reckon your your sort s strong selling points are 
defend your strengths and and uh what you 're good at and what you enjoy 
actually 
Uhm 
Uh I don't really know 
Day Centre 
but I seemed to get on fine with everybody there 
Yeah 
yeah 
Right 
And you felt comfortable and uh 
Mm I thoroughly enjoyed that 
Good 
I think that 's very important 
uh and you won't you won't you won't perhaps succeed as well as you could in doing something you did enjoy 
Yeah 
Did enjoy 
Now I spoke to Karen this 
When did I speak to Karen 
On 
When did I speak to Karen 
She had a big argument with her mother on Sunday 
Yeah 
They were calling each other everything under the sun basically 
But when 
How long how long was she staying for 
Indefinite 
Really 
I think so 
Not quite sure 
but apparently uhm Karen 's mother asked Neil to do the hoovering 
he refused 
she started shouting and somehow Karen got involved 
She called Karen a dirty Jewess 
She didn't 
Her mother 
Her own mother 
I mean that 's 
Ap apparently they just really had a big argument 
so they 'll have too much mortgage 
Yeah 
It really is 
I know 
With Ian only a tennis coach 
Yeah 
Well even now 
I mean if he has good rates you know he 's good bank rates and he 's got a steady job 
That 's true 
Yeah 
I mean Father I suppose can always help I mean because I mean they still I mean Father and Mother sort of they still don't get on very well anyhow so 
Well Karen reckons that she 's just kind of jealous of Karen and Ian because she 's got nothing out there apart from Salvatore 
Because she 's got a lot of money she doesn't do anything all day long 
even 
yeah 
Just spends loads of money 
But is she is she still in the house then 
She hasn't moved out to a hotel or anything 
No 
She walked out on she went back to Rome on Sunday 
Really 
Oh dear 
It does not bode very well 
No 
So that Karen 's a bit cheesed off 
I 'm going to give her a I 'm seeing her on Saturday 
We 're going into Kingston 
What a nice thought 
You did that already once with her 
I 've been waiting to speak to Alastair and Cheryl 
Cheryl said she c she 'd ring me back but she never does 
Uhm I sp I 've been getting into contact with Clare from uhm Washington because she 's actually moved 
So and we spoke to I spoke to her yesterday and everything 's lovely 
So you know how it was originally 
at the moment 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Oh that 's right 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Well it was some imagined slight on her part I 'd imagine 
Mm 
I mean she realised after that time that I you know when I bumped into her 
Not personal looks you know attractivewise 
but when she glances at you if looks 
Mm 
If looks can kill 
Yes 
Yes exactly 
Yes 
Well she might be coming to Clare 's party 
I don't know 
I 've asked her along 
Peter 
for a week 
Yeah 
Yeah that 's good 
Oh yes that 's right 
Just a holiday 
Just a last minute holiday really 
Well it 's cheap out there at this time of the year 
Well I mean Anna hasn't had a holiday at all this year with her mother and everything looking after her mother all the time 
Is her mother the one that had the stroke 
Yeah 
Well she 's in an old people 's home 
Yeah 
She is I think 
So tell me about this field this field trip of yours then 
My field trip 
My weekend away 
Your dirty weekend so to speak 
Well it was 
Well not quite no 
Actually Rogate 's really nice 
Well uh it 's about you just go straight down the A Three 
It took me an hour and a quarter to get there down there uh 
I went down on early Saturday morning 
so I left here about nine o'clock or so 
Uhm and uhm I had to sta I had to get down there by nine uhm 
so I whizzed on down the A Three and went past Guildford 
Mm 
Mm 
So what time did you have to leave 
Oh God I don't know 
Seven thirty or something 
You know 
Not that I 
uh I left about a quarter to eight or so 
But I wanted to be there by nine to check everything out but uh 
Because Rogate is just off 
Yeah all the way down there 
But it 's not as far as what 's where 'd where 'd you uh you where you used to live 
All the way down there 
Uh Godalming 
That 's right 
Godalming 
Uhm but it 's a very nice part of the world 
parked the car 
Arrived at the same time as my lecturer who looked really hung over 
He looked so tired 
the previous night up in London and uh by a very famous biologist uh or and bio biochemist called Oliver Rackham 
so we unpacked our stuff and trooped in 
And he 's been there thousands of times before so he he just sort of said the there 's a chart 
Uh go round 
So we did that 
We trooped down to the wing which is actually apart 
It 's apart from the main house 
But actually it 's it 's a lovely pile 
and you 've got lovely views looking out to the South Downs 
But unfortunately both Saturday and Sunday it was really foggy 
Well foggy 
It was misty 
I don't know what it was exactly 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Oh no 
Did you take the camera with you 
I 'm so bad at doing that 
The title of the course was the field trip was Woodland Ecology uhm 
And I learnt how to do uh what they call quadrats 
a quadrat is where you take a section of land 
It doesn't matter whether it 's marsh or fen or heathland or bog or sand dunes or what and 
I don't know whether you 've ever seen it before but they you measure out 
You get nylon rope 
and it 's measured out with knots in it 
so one metre distance between the knots uhm 
You have to make a four by two rectangle on the ground 
you pin it down with nails 
And you lay it on the ground 
It doesn't matter uhm 
Then in this case it was in the woodlands 
Uhm and then within that square that marked off section uhm that is when you discover how many species are in the uhm are in the woodlands 
so that 's what we that 's that 's one part of doing a quadrat uh 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Oh that 's a good idea 
Because what you do is that 
twenty-three of us 
so there were five or six people to a group 
and I think that 
Well we did 
so we had five quadrats 
carrying this out it really sounds strange you know just pinning pieces of uhm rope down on the ground uh to make a a rectangle or a square 
And then you mark down you write down on a list exactly what plants are in it 
And it 's amazing 
There are so many not weeds I know 
I don't call them weeds now 
I don't believe in weeds any more uhm 
wild flowers and uh plants 
And even in winter time it 's really nice 
it 's just like 
So many different kinds 
chalk 
It 's on the chalk downs really so it was uhm 
Saturday and Sunday we visited a wood in the morning which was an oak wood with uhm uhm smaller trees mixed in 
And then then in the afternoon we did uh another oak wood but it was dominated more by fir trees pines and things like that 
And then on Sunday uh we did a third wood in the morning which was different 
You know you I used to think that all you know you think English woodland 's all the same 
it 's just a wood big deal and uh 
But it 's not 
Uhm it 's a system that 's been set up by biologists and ecologists and everything like that 
So uhm so then that means like you get your get your beech woods and your oak woods 
but within the beech and oak woods there are different kinds 
You know you have a beech wood that might be all beeches and it might be on limestone and it might be on chalk or it could be on flint or gravel soil soil 
so really we over the Sun the Saturday and Sunday we investigated these four 
They they were different but they weren't so different uhm 
And there are some 
Uh have you seen dog 's mercury 
D' you know what dog 's mercury is like 
Yeah 
That little plant that grows 
doesn't matter what the soil conditions are whether it 's very acidic or chalk or whatever 
Mm 
mm 
Yeah 
Wow 
Oh really mm 
Yeah 
It grows in anything 
Grows in anything 
Yeah 
Same with ivy and holly as well 
Yeah 
to learn them 
Michelle on Sunday was sort of pronouncing some of the Latin names 
Oh you have to go and enter a competition about that 
Oh look 
so if she does come tonight she 'll probably be stinking of pigs 
Oh charming 
I like pigs though 
So I thought aha 
Yeah 
Oh mm mm 
Good right pigs pigs and 
and dogs 
Mm 
Just because you 're tolerant doesn't mean you have to like it to put up with it but you don't necessarily have to 
I mean it 's stumped me 
I used to I used to sit there 
Maybe they are people that have just never thought about it 
Maybe they are just sort of 
Some people are just completely inarticulate 
hate to say it like working class 
Ho ho 
Seriously 
uh caring and he was struggling to find the words friendly 
And it was like I 'd s it was like I 'd sat him under a 
test 
He obviously felt he was being tested in some way 
Oh and that 's right and then we got to the bit 
Is your student the same student 
No no no 
This was a guy at uhm the drama 
And the funny thing was and then then his wife was is obviously his wife or his girlfriend was sitting there 
so that he didn't have to describe the woman who was sitting there 
he was sweating 
He was obviously afraid of mentioning some girlfriend and offending the wife 
So eventually I had to help the poor guy out 
He was it was it was 
And and some people just just find it very difficult 
in describing people 
Uhm 
Well yes yes 
Well you don't have a problem with that 
artistic people don't 
or a thing like that they just don't have creative minds 
My sister for instance 
She she just doesn't have any kind of a creative mind at all 
And anything that 's just not black and white facts you know scientific facts or mathematic facts she can't get her head round it at all 
Yes 
But people do it all the time 
You sit there you sit there in a canteen wherever you are and you sit and you listen and the conversation next to you someone 's saying he 's really boring blah blah blah he 's really materialistic 
This is what we do all the time 
We sit and describe other people 
and then just describe them 
He 's this and this 
I think people aren't used to describing peoples 's personalities 
No no no 
It was but anyway all I 'm saying is it 's been a very interesting way of meeting people and I wished that really that I 'd that I 'd used people in their thirties 
But they 'd have been more difficult 
and 
and me I c cold you know 
I bluffed myself 
I mean I 'll show it to you later 
But I I I got my ones the ones I chose 
Mm 
Who didn't you like 
Hold on 
I 'll read you the thing and then you can tell me if you recognise them 
Hold on 
Not necessarily very well though 
You don't know this person very well 
Heather Daniels 
Heather Daniel 
Yeah 
Female I don't like 
Disgusting woman 
Uh male I like 
Well she 's called Lynn 
Lynn Radnage 
You don't know her 
Uhm male I like 
Honest clever wise funny perceptive intuitive loving 
Ooh I can't guess 
broadminded patient gentle faithful courageous self-aware allowing honest 
Doesn't begin with R does it and end in Angor 
No 
I was going to question it if so 
No 
Honest clever 
No 
These are all entirely true 
Wise funny perceptive intuitive loving interested 
Oh 
Mike 
Broadminded 
Patient gentle faithful courageous self-aware of feelings allowing 
That 's true 
Really 
for some reason I didn't 
Mm 
Male I don't like 
God I can't remember who this is now 
Oh read it to me 
uncaring 
Oh yes I remember 
Hah 
I don't think you 'd be quite that strong about David Bateson 
No no 
This is the man I chose to marry 
Oh 
Stupid uncaring uninterested 
There 's two kinds of people there 's two kinds of people in the world 
I mean one interesting category is the interested uninterested category 
Uhm so that 's an interesting interesting one 
Anyway here 's Heather 's 
Warm open thoughtful 
Uhm woman she likes 
Woman she doesn't like 
Central quality 
tight 
A man you don't like 
Man you like 
Involved interested 
sense of humour 
Central quality 
involved 
Yes 
Mm 
Yeah 
Involved 
Mm 
Really 
Yeah 
I mean for example there was one girl who I met at U who I interviewed at U C L 
there 's the most striking example of it who was 
really beautiful 
down in a kind of I don't know net 
and very thin and elegant 
And the first thing I said 
and the qualities about her 
Mm 
She liked 
She liked 
A woman that she liked 
The first thing she said was feline 
You know 
And people do people do tend to describe themselves 
so I said 
so I pointed that out to her rather naughtily 
You know 
And jealous is an interesting one 
I think what do they mean 
Well yes 
That 's right 
That 's right 
That 's what is interesting 
How can you describe someone else as jealous 
Mm 
Mm 
How can they tell 
I suppose they just mean they 're behaving in a way that they would if they were jealous 
Particularly sort of peevish sort of way really 
Yeah yeah 
But you can't you can't you can't say somebody 's jealous or not 
And then there are the really bland ones that I think oh come on 
helpful 
Is this the guy that was breaking out into a cold sweat 
Well no there 's lots of people 
I mean you 'd be amazed 
No 
Why do you like someone 
Oh she 's polite 
First quality they like about a friend of theirs is they 're polite 
That that foxes me 
Bitchy is very common 
Yes it is quite 
Mm 
Yes 
I can imagine 
Bitchy 
Uhm 
Well I think they are 
But i it 's just you know the the the qualities that spring to mind 
Outgoing 
Look 
See on this page 
Outgoing outgoing outgoing 
blinkered I think is a nice word if you 're describing someone that you don't like 
Yes 
You know blinkered only able to see their own point of view 
A lot of people struggled with trying to find a lot of people couldn't think of the wo word 
I mean that after I 'd done this for a hundredth I know exactly the words people are trying to find 
but I 'm trying not to prompt them 
Honesty 
Yes 
Honesty is appreciated a lot 
uhm 
Mm 
Really 
Practically all black females start their description of things they like with bubbly 
And some people in their descriptions of of of people that they don't like 
No 
Can't find it 
Kind of frightening 
Really 
Yeah yeah yeah 
So what what kind of words did they use 
Uhm I 'm just trying to find it 
and I can't put my finger on it because of course they 're all anonymous 
Well I think 
But you would 
If somebody has just done something to you that you don't like then you would 
If somebody if when you asked me to describe a man that I didn't like I particularly didn't use Billy because I I I could have come out with a chain of venom a page long 
But that wasn't the idea really because under normal circumstances I like him 
the week before or something 
Yeah 
No 
I mean that that intrigues me 
I never think of anybody as scheming 
Scheming manipulative 
a liar 
But I 
all these 
all these 
malicious 
You think well these are these are people that other people are describing as warm loving friendly 
You know I mean I didn't seem 
Uh here I am talking to all the

Moses Moses believe me 
I spent two years solidly applying

Honestly 
I mean you 're not exactly world 's expert 
You 've only filled in two 
I know 
It 's the first time I 've ever filled these bloody things out 
But you have to 
Just different banks different corporate culture 
Which is why you send one standard C V to all ba all places 
Yeah 
I just have to change my old one and add some things you see 
But what you 'll have to do to mine Mine 's on two pages at the moment 
but what you 'll have to do is shrink it down to just one page 
so I have to change a few things around get rid of a few things 
What 
Do you mean one page as in back and front or just one 
A four 
Well I can do it in very small writing if you want 
on your computer 
Is it Geneva or something 
Well that 's what I mean 
Well that would help if you do want it done by the end of term 
Mm 
Please 
Well if you give me it tomorrow I might be able to do some tomorrow morning before I go to the rugby 
I can only do an hour though 
That would be excellent

God 
Ours is supposed to be about s sensory 
She 's doing a P G C E 
Yes 
Pathetic

Do we actually see what we think we see 
or are we just seeing three-or-four-words 
Oh no 
Seeing 
How do we know what other people see 's the same as what we see 
Who cares 
That 's what it boils down to 
Who cares 
Good 
Ours are supposed to be a thousand words not two words 
Three words 
Three thousand 
They don't know if it would have been good otherwise 
Yeah 
Three thousand 
How much have you got to write 
I 've done about to two 
Just consolidate now 
I mean I 've got all the notes 
It 's just a question of putting them in order but I just can't be bothered 
I know 
It is physically impossible to force myself to work sometimes

So that 'll be nice 
When 's your Mum coming 
She 's coming Well I 'm a bit confused but I think she 's coming next weekend 
Really 
And the reason why I thought you might be Dad was because he is probably in England as we speak 
Is he

Cos I heard this voice say 
hello 
and it 's distorted and I thought 
and then there was a man 's voice 
and I thought 
it 's Dad and Debbie 
They 've drove driven straight here 
Dad and Debbie 
It 's like they 've been casted 
And I thought

Is he really 
We have pictures and put him in our room

She doesn't 
Laura 's amazing 
Once on the phone really 
I 've never heard 
You know I 've had 
I had three people try to ring me 
and constantly engaged here apparently 
Three people 
Really 
Laura 's amazing 
When she gets on that phone she just does not get off 
I know 
I 've never heard anybody spend so much time on the phone 
And such useless drivel most of the time 
I feel very sorry for the person talking to her 
It looks a good vehicle yeah 
It does 
Very handy 
I think I think it 's Japanese though more than it does 
It 's a very handy vehicle 
A Land Rover would 've done far better 
Well it 's a bit more than a Land Rover 
No no 
But a Land Rover adapted would 've been brilliant 
Yeah Yeah 
Would 've been far more the part 
Oh is it over 
No 
Oh what a shame 
Ha ha 
He says

And he goes doesn't talk well

Bitch 
So tell me Moses where

Stockwell 
Stockwell London 
Mm

My parents are 
Yes but they 've been over here for a while now 
Yes 
Well so how long did you live in Portugal for 
Well I came over when I was six years old OK 
And then I went back to Portugal when I was ten years old and then came back when I was thirteen or fourteen fifteen 
Right 
Yeah 
And you 've been living in London ever since 
You 've never lived anywhere else in England or elsewhere 
Yeah 
No thank heavens 
Ah I see 
I would not live anywhere else in England 
This is some background history 
I thought it might be quite useful 
G'day 
And yourself 
Oh myself 
I 've always lived in London 
Good Jew from Mill Hill 
Yeah 
Good Jew from Mill Hill 
Yes 
So do you consider yourself very much a stereotype kind of Jew 
Oh no 
Not at all 
No 
I 'm a bit more Anglicized than most 
You what 
Bit more Anglicized than most 
Really 
But have you seen this advert 
No 
I have not 
Oh dear 
I love that one 
I wear that 
Do you 
I mean under my armpits 
Devastating effect though obviously 
Keep talking with me

Don't tell me to keep talking or I 'm going to keep quiet 
I use 
This is actually a fool 
I No

I 've seen yours 
What is it called fifty-nine or something 
Oh I 've got I 've got one of those little ones 
You must let me smell it 
Four seven one one 
It 's good stuff 
Mm 
It 's really nice 
I 've got another number and I don't like it very much 
Oh 
Monday 
What 's that 
A thing like you had when you 've got to talk for ten minutes about what it 
was disastrous 
He said it didn't go so bad but he just said it was just very brief and everyone else was very brief 
Yeah 
Why 
I mean I don't mind doing work 
Why 
Did they criticise his 
Eh 
Did they criticise his proposal 
No 
Not at all 
But he never I he never mean he just doesn't make any effort to talk to anybody there 
That 's funny 
He really does not 
I don't think he knows one person on that course to speak to 
D' you know o on a course of eighty-three people he does not know 
He does not 
And I 'm not exaggerating 
He doesn't seem to care though does he which isn't such a bad thing 
to one person on that course 
Mm 
Uh three-or-four-words 
He 's a good bloke though 
I can't understand it 
Well precisely 
He does seem to be a good laugh once he 's here in the house 
Yeah 
And even when you go out with him 
I said did you hear my joke 
Do you want to hear my joke 
Oh God no 
Why does it take ten women with P M T to change a light bulb 
I don't know 
Get over 
Anyway do you want to hear mine 
Think about it 
OK 
Uhm Fergie and Diana 
Yeah 
They 're on their way to a Palace uhm reception 
thieves whatever 
And they get out the car and one of the thieves goes to the Queen can we have all your money 
you know I 'm royalty 
I don't carry money 
My handbag 's empty 
I don't need to 
I don't have to 
And that 's that 
And then they turn round to Diana 
and they say 
they 
but you know where are all your jewels 
and she says you know I don't have any 
they 're all state property 
You know sovereign state 
And she says to the thieves come on take the Land Rover and leave oh Blind Date and leave them behind 
before we left 
And the Queen goes but where are the jewels that you were wearing 
Oh well I 've sold them too and I 've hidden that in my pants 
And the Queen goes well shame Fergie wasn't here 
Yes 
Quite funny 
I think it 's very good 
I don't you got it 
What do you mean because I didn't 
Wasn't as sophisticated as my joke 
Oh no of course not 
But uhm one finds it so hard to be sophisticated with you generally 
Can we stop now 
I don't know 
I feel very tired 
You see I don't think that three-or-four-words 
I think we 've got at least another five minutes to go 
OK 
Oh let 's see who the hunks are 
There was a Cambridge student on a couple of weeks ago 
Was there really 
Apparently the archetypal tweed suit 
Oh 
Oh don't you know 
He 's got a face like a fish 
I can't stand Cilla Black 
Oh she 's lovely you idiot 
Oh she 's not lovely at all 
I met her exact lookalike 
Well I met her so 
In hospital 
Oh did you 
Her exact lookalike 
Oh he 's a window cleaner 
What 's wrong with that 
Nothing 
Nothing wrong with a career as a window cleaner 
Really 
That 's what I 'll end up doing 
Yeah 
He saves her life 
Yeah 
Who would your lady in a bubble bath be 
I mean I would be tempted to say Kim Basinger 
I don't know 
Who would yours be 
Mm 
Uhm 
Oh my God 
What did he say 
With women I 'm going to close my eyes and try and pick one 
I never 
I 've always wanted 
What did he say 
I know 
But they 're all made up beforehand aren't they 
No 
Not with Cilla I don't think 
Hurray 
Look 
Turn it off 
Robin Hood Robin Hood riding through the glen 
Robin Hood Robin Hood and his merry men 
We 're supposed to be looking at accents not singing ability 
I beg your pardon 
There are accents in singing 
I 'm sure there are 
Turn it off 
So why don't you have my one cos I think I might nip off shortly 
Are you sure 
Mm 
Mmm right amount 
Well I can always get the la the the later one 
No 
That 's fine really 
Oh dear 
Excuse me 
And and the evening dress 
I know 
I feel so much better now I know he 's in London and he 's not going to come round 
Give me a fright 
Oh yeah 
The dreaded Basil 
In a way I wish he had come round yesterday 
Mm 
Would have been sweet 
Yeah 
It 's a shame he 's not going to be back here 
I know 
I know 
Yeah 
New York 
Well 
I 'm not sure that he is actually 
to Cambridge 
Yes 
w worked 
Laura likes tea bags you see after they 've had taken some of the strength out 
You don't need to explain to us 
Bloody skinflint 
Is the poison in that one 
Yeah 
So make sure she drinks it 
When she starts to have the convulsions in a minute nobody call the doctor 
we haven't noticed 
Yeah right 
I think it 's for the best 
The mattress 
I do 
It 's for her own good 
Good of everyone around her 
Oh goodness 
Oh well 
Never mind 
Excuse me 
Oh it 's very light 
It 's not as strong as it looks 
Thank you 
The way she 's feeling for about seven years 
Mm 
My God it makes me cry though watching things like this 
I should have 
Oh dear 
early grave 
Lick right round the rim 
moderate Shiites 
What 's a 
put the pin back 
Yeah that 's it 
Time for bed 
He 's brilliant your dad 
D' you think so 
I didn't 
Well ca I can't get 
Here you are now I 've made it 
Oh thank you 
Sir 
Probably all germ infested 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Did you enjoy Vic Reeves 
Yes 
It was really good 
Oh great 
Good 
Cos those take two hours long or something 
three-or-four-words 
Yeah 
this is the time of evening when I like to put a a hazelnut under a squirrel or something 
He was doing it with Golden Grahams 
Have you got his album 
Yeah 
I 'd really love to tape it from you if you if you didn't mind 
Yeah 
If you give me a tape I 've got a tape to tape and I can run it off 
Oh great that 'd be 
Well 
I mean 
cos a actually thinking about it I 've not got a uhm record player or anything 
So yeah 
You can make tunes from it 
Don't compare yourself with anyone else 
I 'll go in the corner 
And strip off again 
Oh I know 
glam and Sheila 's very glamorous 
And she 
I hate going to parties that you don't know whether to 
Excuse me 
Yeah 
I know 
It 's like some friends of mine got engaged in uhm but they 
and they had an engagement party in June 
and it was just like Sunday brunch 
And then and I still didn't know what everybody was wearing 
And everybody was just wearing jeans which is quite 
You know when you just don't know yeah 
Yeah it 's weird 
Feel terrible 
Mm 
Oh God 
That was helpful wasn't it 
Thanks 
I don't think you 've got anything to worry about though 
I mean i i if you 've you 've got a coat to cover everything up 
Mm 
I have 
Yeah 
You 're right 
I think I 've got it on backwards or something 
I put it on with the zip done up 
Headache city 
Got a 
That 's right 
I 'll give you that stuff Caroline 
to be honest 
You think the brown 
OK 
Thing is with brown if it 's really smart that 's fine 
but then if it 's not they 're not so smart that 's fine as well 
you know 
Whereas that 's really smart isn't it 
Yeah 
Yes 
Yeah 
It 's more dressy isn't it 
Yeah 
Mm 
It 's nice to have a contrast of colour 
Yes 
That 's true 
Mm 
Yes 
Otherwise you look like a black thing 
Especially if it 's black tie 
rails for sale 
Mm 
Really 
Yeah 
They 're very useful 
They 're really good 
Really useful 
I think the dress 
Cos then you can always take the shirt off 
It 's brilliant 
You 're right 
Ah 
God 
I think that 's the kind of thing I could easily do in my present state of mind 
Low blood sugar 
No brains 
Something this happened to me 
I was feeling really exhausted 
Oh 
I 'm always doing that 
And and I fill my tro my thingy up my basket 
and then I decide I don't want anything that 's in it 
so I run round round all the shelves putting everything back 
in a flap 
In a flap 
Right 
You look really nice 
You 're right 
I know it seems I 'm getting a bit carried away 
I know 
to look nice 
And black earrings 
They 're nice yeah 
I wouldn't really be looking forward to be getting dressed up on Friday 
I know 
I 'm glad w I said to Laura I 'm glad we didn't dress up last night because three-or-four-words 
It wasn't worth it at all 
Good God 
You never know though do you 
It would have been really embarrassing 
Cos sometimes here everyone goes mental 
I know 
But it 's definitely black tie Friday 
May as well just wear all brown I suppose 
Mm 
J for tomorrow 
mmm 
I 'd wear what 
but the brown one 's a bit short 
Well I just feel it 's so short to wear with hi such high heels 
But do you think it 's all right 
Mm 
Yeah it 's really good 
I know lots of them will wear hi 
But uhm 
It 's just cos you 're not used to them 
Yeah 
OK 
Let 's get rid of it 
That would be awful wouldn't it 
There were some headdresses in Debenham 's actually we which had sort of like half of a shawl on them 
I horrid dresses that they had which they had like a massive shawl bit in velvet and then nothing on the other side 
and it wa oh 
it looked like they 'd forgotten half of it or something 
It was horrid 
Yeah 
It 's what 
Yeah 
Ugh 
Debenham 's has some very funny clothes 
Yeah it does 
A real hotch potch 
Yeah 
No 
Thing that pisses me off about my sister 
whenever we have a family lunch she 's about six foot tall 
I hate her sometimes 
Does she like being really really really tall 
I think so 
Mhm 
cos she is quite 
How much older is she than you Vicky 
How old is she 
But she 's actually my half sister 
Mmm 
I look like him a bit 
I 've got his big fat nose 
Mm 
so look 
if we meet at seven o'clock at Covent Garden tube station outside 
OK 
We 've got to get to uhm 
Oh I 'll bring it in in the morning 
Shall I bring it 
What 
W we come out 
we go to the top of the road Queensway where it meets Westbourne Grove 
opposite Titles 
but uhm 
Yeah 
Right 
That 's right 
Very convenient indeed 
What 's the name 
You got one Sid 
So sore 
Plaster hurts 
Yeah 
some new shoes 
shall I shall I bring it in in the morning or what shall I do 
Well how shall I 
Yeah 
Right 
so when are you meeting up with these other two then 
It may have to be next Monday morning during the day at my flat 
actually I 've been thinking 
That 's the best solution 
Well i it may be yeah 
I mean there 's no I 've got uh my neighbours 
Yeah 
Problem 
Bring them round here 
Yeah 
I love that perfume 
What 
I think it 's part one or something of it 
and it 's by 
Sticking plasters 
D' you mind 
this one 
Yeah 
On there 
That 's right yeah 
What 
Just mention it on your own 
You 'll know it 
Yes 
Yeah 
Well I 'll 
Right 
caught me 
Yeah 
Really caught you 
Well actually playing it 's made all the difference 
Hasn't it 
because you live through it 
Yeah 
tuning on it 
Well Dominguez 
but Dominguez ha has tuning that 's so radical 
But I mean you could do it on a steel string 
I mean it got it 's to do with the tension of the strings 
It doesn't 
What did you say 
Well I am 
the stick 
Well what books shall I bring along 
some books 
you can teach him if need be 
I 'll bring the stick down 
in terms of 
No 
We will do 
That 's obvious 
if we want to see how he interacts with us too 
even 
It 'll always end up like that because we always end up bringing our things to do 
and some sort of 
What d' you mean by provisionally we can do it 
Yeah 
problems 
That 's quite interesting anyway 
that just because it 's an old song 
Oh I know 
We 'll do that new one 
Can I have a glass of water please 
Take some salt in as well 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Do you want it 
Do you want tap water or this 
Just normal water 
It 's it 's Spa 
Solpadeine is is uh 
What 
you want to use the tap water then 
Just tap water will do 
I I said did he mind if I came in dry and he said no 
The sound wasn't too good 
Did you get it all 
What 's the sound which is 
There 's one particular sound 
actually clear as 
Fanny Waterman 
have you heard of her 
Of course I have 
I 'm sorry 
If you 
You have 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Fanny Waterman 
that she 's written 
Oh right 
Well 
I mean 
of of a collection of what was rather a small piece of 
Yeah 
Yeah 
A recital repertoire or concert pieces 
No no 
beginner student things 
Or student repertoire 
Yeah 
Well they 're all meant for beginners 
They ought to be called recital repertoires 
But 
Are they good 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
They are 
She 's got one one one of the early ones which has a base a very basic supplement 
I don't know if that 's the recital one 
If that 's the first 
She said that she 'd find out precisely whether I should get Book One or Book Two tomorrow so I 'll ring her Wednesday morning 
at the moment 
Oh right 
on Wednesday then 
Yeah 
out for Thursday 
so I 've got to get them on 
uhm 
I 've got to get them for Wednesday 
Yeah 
I we always have those you know 
What 
or the Watermans 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Because they do actually publish some single sheets 
Yeah 
Oh yeah 
Yeah 
And I could bring the guitar 
I 'm going to the problem is I 'm going to tennis 
and then I 've got in to 
You don't want me to come here and then go off to 
Oh leave it here 
That 's an idea 
You mean leave it at the Tortoise 
No 
I 'm saying I mean I could meet you here tomorrow night and then we could go off 
No good 
So there seems to be 
Is that awkward for you then 
Oh yes 
What 
To meet there 
Can't you 
Because you have to hang around H M V and then walk over or get the tube there 
What time d' you want to meet in Johnson Street 
Seven o'clock 
Yeah 
That 's OK 
So then you can get the tube 
Green Park 
You 've got a pass 
have you 
Try and bring it in in the morning here 
That 'd be the best thing 
won't it 
yes 
see someone at two o'clock St John 's Wood 
and drop it in 
Just the one thing 
you know 
and I 'll just 
uh 
I 'll do that 
Yeah 
anyway so 
it 'll get bashed as too heavy 
Oh no 
Yeah 
let 's see 
Yeah 
That 's that 's fine 
I love to sing 
And that it is nice to sing 
song 
But I didn't realise how nice until you sing you don't realise how 
where it pulls don't you in the right ways 
Yeah 
The lyrics are good 
I know 
You hear the good bits 
Where 's my pencil 
Oh it 's 
yeah 
Over there 
I don't know where I 've got to 
It could be in a number of piles 
No 
I think 
Piles 
I don't think it 's in well it must be here 
It 's blue 
isn't it 
Yeah 
Black really 
Black 
these black guys in the gym 
They are always singing in the the men 's 
I got 
Well that kind of leads to certain disaster 
All that is is absolutely so ham 
calling Jesus 
It 's a cultural thing that you know 
They do they do it with all these gaps 
Cos it 's very sincere 
that is 
And it 's the oppos it 's the exact antithesis of real soul 
Yes 
Can you open a little more 
A little more in vowels d' you see 
with that sound 
I 'm not quite placing yes not quite placing 
At the ooo 
Do you know what I mean 
But it seems to me that uh you 're not opening that you 're not opening up the vowel in advance you 're 
you 're doing it sort of when you actually get there 
Too late 
No 
But it 's 
centring 
Yeah 
So you already feel your palate up just before you sing the note 
Yes 
You do something like 
Mm 
Yes 
I 'm dipping 
Yes yes 
Yes 
Big difference 
Yes 
That 's much better 
No no no 
Yes 
That 's better 
Mm 
Yes 
That 's that 's It 's like sliding I have 
Yes 
yes 
in time 
Yes 
big difference 
absolutely 
on the third one 
Oo oo oo 
Yes 
It 's The sound 's lost 
You 're hitting it too far forward now 
No 
otherwise it 's Ooooo 
It 's too tight you see 
Yes 
Yes 
Too contrived 
Make sure your jaw 's unhinged 
So this is how you I 'm I 'm sort of imposing my voice on it instead of letting it come naturally 
I 'm sort of giving it a slant 
You 're not open enough at at this level 
Yeah 
Open it 
Yeah 
I think it could be even a bit more open 
Always towards O 
Yes 
That 's more like it 
That 's right 
Yeah 
and think very hard on your palate 
That 's it 
Yes 
Be careful 
Be careful that you don't let your palate drop and owowow and you get that sound 
Mm 
Yeah so you 
No 
Let 's do it this way 
Sorry 
It 's all right 
meantime 
Yeah 
Yes 
That one I haven't worked at I mean 
OK 
Yes 
Yes 
The space here is exactly the same but you tighten that Ah perhaps just with a little 
That 's all 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yes 
Yeah 
Yes 
Mm 
Yes 
Yes 
Yes 
But take care 
That was better 
Yes 
change isn't it 
Yes 
Is it irritating 
It just sounds a little affected 
No 
Not at all 
It 's just heavy 
It 's just heavy 
It 's just a bit coughy there 's 
there 's no strain whatsoever 
No 
That 's fine 
Work at that and and do listen to your pitch 
Yes 
That one 
I 'm It 's the same with the sight-singing exercises 
I 'm sure I 'm 
I 'm coming last week with you 
last time I 'm coming down 
I 'm not quite getting the right sharp 
Yes 
I drop when I come down 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Make sure it still resonates 
Yes 
It 's a little 
Yes 
And now you lean over that on the high notes 
Yes 
Bre 
Yes 
Could I do that little high bit a little bit slower 
Yes 
That was correct 
Yes 
Fine 
Right 
You see if you could keep it in 
Yes 
Yeah 
place 
Yeah 
Sort of 
Yes 
Flat 
No 
Yes 
Try and judge where you 
but You didn't do it then 
No no no 
No no no 
You 're taking You 're using an awful lot of breath 
Yeah 
I know 
I seem to be doing this in a different place 
Yes 
You are now 
but I 'm getting the right pitch 
and I 'm doing 
I 'm putting you off 
No 
You 're not 
No 
I 've got to get it 
No 
Oh no 
I 'd better try again 
No 
That 's not right 
That 's nearer to it 
Yes 
It 's sort of 
No no no 
Try it 
A little more 
A little more in the hard palate 
There 
Yes 
It 's really 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I think we 
It just sounds a little toward that bit tired 
Sorry 
Tired 
Toward 
It does sound a little tired 
Yeah 
It is 
something 's resting on it 
rise above it 
It 's like it 's 
I 
You can 
Of course you can if you can place it 
keeping the ball in the air 
When you were saying about the analogy it 's the rising sun 
when you do this 
You go You have to hold 
And then it 's like one two three one two three one two three 
moving 
you 've got to keep it there and the audience has got to see it up there 
It 's wonderful flamenco 
And the thing that 's so wond wonderful 
Oh gosh 
Yes 
Oh yes 
Yes 
Yes 
Yes 
Quite 
Antonio 's 
Don 
Antonio 
I know 
I heard of him 
unbelievable 
He was 
He was 
Yes 
and his troupe 
Yes 
The houses were always packed 
There is one group called 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yes 
But he was 
You saw him in town did you always 
I saw him in London 
Palladium or something 
but I 've seen him more than once 
There 's no one to compare 
but he never comes over 
But there 's no male dancer like that 
There 's There 's a group called Coimbre Flamenco who I saw at Sadler 's Wells 
Yes 
Oh yes 
Yes 
Mm 
Mm 
Oh he was 
And he was very slight 
Yeah 
You know nothing 
His face was nothing to look at 
But he 's 
But the minute he came on the stage 
and there was a spotlight and it was just him 
you know 
Yes well I used to find it so exciting 
knocked you sideways 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yes I know 
I 
Yes 
Yes 
Yes 
Yeah 
My parents said exactly the same thing 
He just had this amazing 
Yes 
It is the most wonderful It 's a wonderful communication that dance and it 's very sensual 
So intense 
And they did sing 
and a guitarist and a voi and a singer 
Great 
aren't there 
Yes 
Yeah 
Field 
Fields 
Yes at a time 
And it just sets the thing alight 
It 's not 
Somebody 's got to focus it 
Yes exactly 
It does 
It does 
No 
It isn't the same 
You need a focus 
Yes 
Mm 
Basic ballet 
Yes 
and the positioning 
I mean it 's basically Alexander Technique I think that 
the straight back 
Yes 
something like that 
Mm 
But of course Alexander came along after classical ballet 
Yes 
uh uh classical ideas and adapted himself 
That 's what I thought 
You know 
well 
It was very much his own idea wasn't it 
D' you D' you have d' you have that book on him 
Do 
I couldn't find it 
I don't know what 
I think I must have lent it to somebody 
The girl from the Guildhall who I started last week with guitar she she says she practises it and she 's going to tell me what she does 
But she 's very hot on posture 
But she goes to a teacher 
W 
I think she does 
Uhm I haven't thought 
The thing is you 're not supposed to do it without your teacher 
Yes 
Oh I see 
Yeah 
That 's what they say 
They don't like you to do anything until you 're very well established 
Mm 
Grooves 
Yeah 
Yes 
Well she must she must 've had a teacher in Spain 
She 's already said whether 
the the the it 's marvellous it just gives you a you know 
It 's very good for 
What 's good about ballet 
it 's 
you 'd have a back 
But the focus of the eyes is similar to focus when you 're doing singing exercises 
not looking down not looking you know 
That 's That 's related 
And control of all these 
Yes 
Yes yes 
Yes 
Quite 
and do all this 
Do all this 
They don't want to catch anybody 's eye 
I mean it can be very offputting 
So they 've actually got to learn 
you know but yet to look as if they 're singing to the audience 
to sweep all the faces without actually catching an eye you know 
But I find with young singers very often that that it 's that they 'll they 'll be quite still but their eyes are and I always think it 's like they 're looking to the nearest means of escape you know 
their eyes sort of dart all over the hall and it looks if they 're trying to think where do I make for if if it gets too heavy you know 
It It has a very nervous uhm 
Yeah 
Of course 
Mm 
Yeah 
Mm 
Yes 
Yes it 's 
That 's very difficult sort of that side of it 
To actually learn to be poised and to just focus on one 
To focus 
Yes 
It 's quite 
The b The best singer is this Olaf Bergh that I 've seen 
There 's actual 
He has total concentration 
And it 's totally relaxed and concentrated 
And I mean it it gets to the whole audience and the audience doesn't do all this coughing and spluttering that they do between songs 
And to get that 
gait and tone 
He presumably works 
Yeah 
Yes 
Yes 
That 's marvellous isn't it 
Do you think 
I must see him now 
He 's coming over 
I know he 's coming again 
Is he 
Yeah 
Oh 
Well there 's a chap that singer at Trinity 
He 's now working there and what 's the name of that Emmy Ameling is coming next month 
Elly Ameling 
Yeah 
Emmy Ameling 
Elly 
Elly Ameling 
She 's coming 
But there 's nothing left I don't think 
Oh there won't be now 
No 
is away 
she 's ill 
I know 
You said 
Well I 'll go and I 'll ask him 
Because he 's working on the door he may just hap hear of a few seats 
I 'll tell you if I can get something 
Yeah 
But it 's next month I think she 's going to 
He said that she 's coming soon 
I thought it was October 
I think 
Maybe it 's just not 
would you like to do some sight singing 
Mm 
Yes 
I 'd love to 
Just you know 
Would you like me to use your this book or 
No 
because then you don't you can still use yours 
D' you see what I mean so that you don't actually 
this this book is mostly about what they call modulation where you actually go to another key in the course of the exercise 
for the time being 
Yeah 
Yeah 
No 
Oh yeah uh during the exercise 
What I would actually like to do 
Yes 
It 's OK 
Yeah 
Yes 
That 's fabulous 
I love that 
Yeah 
That 's great 
Really good 
That 's lovely 
I 'm just trying to 
I like that sort of exchange between 
I can't possibly account for it 
We 've got a song there already 
I 'm just trying 
How does it go now 
We got it down 
was a bit 
D' you want me to put anything like cheese on toast on 
or anything you 've had lunch already 
I wouldn't mind some coffee actually 
Coffee 
Is that all right 
We can work again on Thursday 
Yeah 
That 's all right I mean 
I thought it 's been 
I know 
I really 
Yeah 
if that 's all that you know 
I still find it 
I can't say how it 's 
I mean you 
I 'll just say you know that your s guitar playing is so pianistic 
If it meant anything 
No 
It is 
What sort of things does your mate write about 
Lyrics Just purely sort of 
existential 
Are they 
What he he 
Does he 
Is he eloquent 
Is he a very good lyric writer 
He 's very widely read 
Sorts of what 
D' you mean philos philosophy and stuff like that or 
I like 
I 've read 
He always seems who they 're going to have a passion for 
I 've I 've read masses of stuff but I mean y you can only draw on things that are appropriate to what you 're doing can't you 
I mean I could write a whole sequence of stuff based on you know 
How does he 
I mean how does he 
Does he work hard on 
Yeah I know yeah 
Yeah 
Basically he left school at sixteen so he 's always had a sort of guilty feeling 
He 's always made up for it though 
It 's not very good 
it 's not very 
Yeah yeah 
He ro reads a lot 
and he always seems to know who are the latest and the 
Right 
So he 's 
That 's the import 
read all the time 
But he 's not 
He 's very into magical realism and all that sort of crap you know 
What 's that 
Magical realism 
have you heard of that 
Magical realism 
Yeah Angela Carter 
Yeah 
Yeah 
And what these Latin American uh 
I can't stand those 
uh you know they are sort of associated with you know 
That 's it 
that perfect 
Yeah I 'd like 
Are you tired or something 
Just a touch of milk in that this time 
Fine yeah 
Have a quick break 
Yeah 
That 's really uh 
it 's original 
Yeah 
Yeah 
No no it 's yeah I mean 
Yeah 
yeah 
That 's brilliant 
It 's like 
Nobody 's really doing quite anything like this 
Not really with guitar and voice in that way 
No No but not as advanced 
things I mean I think my chord 'll 
But also it 's not it 's not the bits 
Yeah well 
influences as well 
Yes 
It 's got It 's got a great sort of variety of influence as well as being your own feel 
Yeah 
Yeah which is what it 's about really 
Yeah 
I mean it 's really like 
some of his 
Yes I 
I know I 've I 've heard some of his earlier 
I don't know his recent work 
but uh his his old stuff 's fantastic some of it 
is it 
you know solid 
You mean like all that uh Solid Air and all that stuff you like 
Yeah 
What about The Apprentice then 
That 's what 
really depressing is it 
or 
I don't really know actually 
Charming 
Lovely 
Sorry 
You saw the clock didn't you 
Yeah 
Where was this 
Oh I remember 
Oh yes 
Actually I knew I had seen it and I couldn't think where 
Yes 
Oh the clock 
Yeah 
A slate 
Yes 
I didn't realise they were wisdom teeth until someone pointed them out 
I had a couple out uhm last 
How 's your chin 
Slight it 's still slightly numb cos I had them out under a local anaesthetic and they really really hurtled me around 
was really stubborn 
Is it any better now 
They 're slightly better 
I don't know 
And uh when I opened my eyes in fact there was a woman with her hands both hands s heavily down on my chest while the uhm dentist was cutting 
Mm ooh 
It was qu 
I mean I I can laugh about it now 
Mm 
That 's right 
That 's right 
I could never have anything under local 
I want a general 
Well yeah 
And it can be more dangerous 
But a friend of mine pulled some cartilage in her leg when she was playing squash 
And it was awful because they had to give her uh uh uh injection in her back 
It was apparently really dangerous because if they get the wrong point there 
anaesthetic was you know 
And that was about nine hours that she just couldn't move 
Mm 
Earl Gray tea for everyone 
Yeah please 
Out of the teapot that dribbles 
Crispy noodles anybody 
Oh no 
Oh 
Oh no 
W well did he leave it there 
Oh 
I 've heard horrible stories 
I 've heard horrible stories of people having vaccinations and the needles getting broken 
Yeah John Barlow had that happen to him once at school 
Was it painful when they 
Cos then you would you 'd feel it if it 
Oh 
No 
But if the needle broke 
Yeah 
Cos I remember having my stitches done in Spain 
cos I 'd just had a dreadful accident 
And they were done perfectly 
This is a very good soup 
I mean I can't really remember what was going on 
And I realised that was just th th 
My chin was 
They did a very good job thank goodness 
My wrist is a lot better now 
Good 
a broken wrist 
And my ankle 
in Germany 
Mm 
I hadn't I hadn't either before then 
I haven't 
I know 
It wasn't a very nice time to do it at your place for the first time 
No 
Why couldn't 
It was wonderful 
That was it 
Yeah 
That was it 
Oh that 's horrible 
I 've had that done 
Oh no 
How come you know this 
What did you g actually get 
an anaesthetic 
I don't remember having an anaesthetic for mine 
Did you 
Yeah I did 
Cos I had it cauterised 
Do they always an 
He did that 
Mother asked me whether you 'd 
How old were you 
You don't want to see 
Is that when you had the smelling salts 
And did he pour it over you 
or just 
Well actually smelling salts are really good 
Uhm uhm I thought it was a liquid 
It 's just sort of it is actually salt is it I I 
It 's ammonia or something isn't it 
Oh yeah that smells like urine doesn't it 
He went on to have a long and illustrious career 
Oh God 
That 's the worst you could say of a doctor 
He meant well 
Yes 
You 've probably gone down in dinner party anecdotes for that 
our dentist said to Sue before she was go going to have her wisdom teeth out 
oh don't worry 
Only one in so and so dies 
I 've only lost one patient he said 
Yes 
Talked about a percentage 
Well he was talking about uhm the advantages of a uh a general over a local anaesthetic for my wisdom teeth 
And he said I said what about general 
He said oh well 
Uhm I think I 'll do them actually by hand some of them by hand some of it 
OK 
That 's really funny 
We both bought watches at different times and different places 
and we ended up with the same uhm same make and same sort of model but 
but mine 's slightly more expensive 
They they are basically the same watch but 
Ah hah 
The same ghastly family taste 
And I didn't even know you had that watch 
Mm 
You don't like coffee particularly strong do you 
Uhm strong is all right 
That 's OK 
Mm 
Mm 
Uhm 
So we 're conditioned to like this type of watch 
Oh we have so much in common 
What 's that 
Yes 
That 's right 
It 's a family trait 
Yes 
That 's right 
I I saw a picture of myself yesterday in an album with uhm sitting up in bed next to my Bay City Rollers poster 
Oh no way 
Bay City Rollers and Ray Clemence s' legs 
You were interested in the Famous Five 
The Famous Five were better than Bay City Rollers weren't they 
Well you enjoyed reading them 
Can't say that you didn't enjoy that 
No 
I can't say I didn't 
Bet you read every book as well 
You di you weren't into Famous Five 
Yes 
I know 
Did you ever read The Far Away Tree 
That was very good 
No 
Well it was really good 
It 's a tree with all these people living in it and 
Is it too strong 
No no no no 
Mm 
Oh 
And there 'd be this guy that always used to snore with his mouth wide open in the tree 
and and they the others used to pop acorns in through his mouth 
Oh it was an Enid Blyton book 
Uhm 
Do you know where it might be because uhm Bob and I were talking about it the other 
Well Bob hasn't seen Busy Busy World but he likes Richard Scarry 
No 
Think so 
Yes 
Yes 
Well actually isn't it in the loft somewhere 
Uhm if you come across any uhm Ian word-whispered 
Mm 
Yeah 
In the loft I think actually 
You mean 
Right hand side when you uh get through 
Well I mean yeah when you just w walk in 
Yes 
I think 
Yeah 
Don't forget to look for them 
No 
But I have a feeling they might be right by the door but if they 're not then it 's not worth it 
No 
There 's a box of books 
Yes 
A box of books 
Yeah 
Well I can only have a look 
No 
won't look herself probably 
Yeah 
That 's a good idea 
I 'll look myself 
All right 
Thinking of moving your table out to your main room 
You may want to do that 
Right that 's cleared up 
Quickly cleared off 
Sorry 
That was quickly cleared off 
Fine he says 
Love from everybody 
Will that be all right 
Orange juice 
Mmm super 
Thank you 
What if I uhm do you think I better freeze the other half of these 
There is another plate in the 
Uhm I know 
You will miss breakfast 
Yes that would be very 
Breakfast dry freeze 
You could just put them down there 
Haven't really had breakfast 
Back to the 
Look in the bottom drawer 
Do you think you would like to eat 
for breakfast 
Yes 
I mean you don't have to 
When I was alone in Barcelona I was having avocado and French bread for breakfast 
Oh 
Tell us about Barcelona then 
And the avocados are so cheap 
They are about I don't know ten P or something for avocados 
The market in Barcelona 
Thank you very much 
You know something 
I lived on avocado and French bread for breakfast 
It doesn't sound that serious but it was just because it was cheap 
And cheese and bread 
I lived on cheese bread and tomatoes and oranges when I was 
Good heavens 
It must have 
Did you not like the German cakes then 
And you lost weight 
Oh I see 
I could live on cake 
You know what there is in the drawer 
What 
Oh he 's jumping up again 
Oh I 'll go 
Twenty past eight 
Ah yeah 
Fancy a drink John 
We 've got some left 
I think all the pubs are closed 
No 
other drinks in the in the other cupboard cupboards if you fancy it 
I didn't mean go out for a drink 
I meant would you like a drink 
Would you like a drink from the fridge John 
unless I go out there 
Catherine are you going to have everything 
Uhm I 'll have a vodka and lemonade if you 've got any 
Yes 
Yeah 
That 's right 
Fizzy lemonade 
Yeah 
You did not say that at all 
You said 
means uh 
Oh it 's sort of a kind of a a sort of a a negative kind of a word in a way like 
Have you got orange juice 
Yes 
didn't you 
Strange 
in the fridge 
Oh actually I 'll have vodka and orange 
Yeah 
I 'll have vodka and orange in it 
But it 's all Del Monte 
Yes 
I mean 
So 
Yeah 
Well Del Monte uh uh are very instrumental in uh keeping the apartheid regime together in uh South Africa 
Yeah 
And that 's why I will never drink Del Monte juice 
Are they 
Oh 
I didn't know that 
That 's why I never drink juice when I come here because the only one you buy is Del Monte 
Well it seems the best one 
Some of the others are too sweet 
It may be may be good for you but it 's not very good for never been very good for the black people in South Africa 
Yeah I don't 
Oh well I can't help that to that extent 
I mean 
Well you can help it 
You could help it by not buying any 
I 
Yes 
I know that 
But I can't I 'm not going to buy something inferior if I want something nice to drink 
I 'll have a vodka and orange 
Have you still got that damn machine on 
But you can't you see you 're not meant to notice it 
It 's got to be the tape 's got to be on for 
because they reckon that it won't be natural 
Yeah 
But they said because you 've got to tell someone in advance you can't just put it on without them knowing 
Not that one he didn't because I didn't have that 
No no 
Yes 
I would put my I would set my tape recorder to record 
Yes 
That 's what he means stripped down 
Yeah 
horrible and say all these ridiculously stupid things about the way things that we say then I 'm going to be a completely pedantic and pick up every little thing that he says 
Yeah 
But you see he you can't win an argument 
but their own 
That 's right 
Because they 're so dogmatic and set in their ways and 
Yeah 
They 're right because they 're the parents 
And we 're wrong because we 're the children 
I I remember being amazed when I grew up that your parents aren't always right 
When you 're little you think they are 
It didn't take very long to realise that 
Catherine 
Yeah 
Sorry 
I can't hear you 
You don't know what you 're talking about at all 
So what what happens in fact 
You 've got to record you 've got to record us for fifteen minutes and and and 
Well as long as possible really but uhm 
Well I can do different I 'm going to do different ones 
You 've got to cut off the first fifteen minutes 
You have to prove to the teacher that you 've got to cut off the first fifteen minutes or do you just 
No I don't have to 
No 
They he just told me this when I when he was explaining it to me 
And it 
Cos I said uhm cos I said if I can't uh 
you know 
so I 'm going to sort of I thought of doing Mum and Dad 
Mum you you know 
and they said 
oh well we we disregard that cu 
cut it 
just disregard 
They start listening 
Oh no actually I 've got this special machine that cuts off 
As soon as it hears my voice it cuts it off 
Do you want anything to eat 
You have special symbols for when you can't can't actually hear something when you 're doing transcribing and that 's what gets transcribed you see 
Well I did a transcribe a transcribed a Terry Wogan interview for an assignment 
And it 's really difficult cos everybody speaks on top of each other and you when you actually lay it out you 've got to do you know 
Thank you Dad 
Of the people you 're interviewing you mean 
Cos there 's so many interruptions 
and it gets it 's a nightmare 
I did one and a half minutes and it took me about three hours just to you know write out and rewrite again 
Yes 
How many people 're in the interview 
Just two 
Only two 
Yeah 
But then I had to do everything 
I was doing all other aspects of communication non-verbal and everything hand movements 
No it was a video 
I videoed it on T V 
Ah 
A radio interview you used 
Oh I see 
Oh 
Do you want anything to eat 
No thanks 
I 'm not hungry Esther 
No 
No 
Do you want anything to eat 
Do you want another one 
I 'm going to do my flatmates as well 
But but I mean like I said I 'd put it in the lounge so they get used to seeing it but they 're every time Jonathan my flatmate goes in he looks at this tape recorder and then if I go he goes out the room for two minutes he comes back and looks at it again 
To see whether it 's on or not 
Yeah 
Well put it in a put it in a little case or a box little box or something 
Yeah 
I should do 
Yeah 
Good idea 
little light or he can't see the button that you press 
so that he 's just not going to know whether it 's on or off 
Little light 
Oh yeah 
That 's a good idea 
Yeah 
Mm 
He doesn't mind 
He says I 've he says I 'm perfectly entitled he says he 's quite happy for me to do it but 
But he wants to know whether it 's on or off though 
He 's just 
Yeah 
In which case which invalidates it 
Well I don't think it invalidates it 
No i it 's not that 
It 's just that it 's better for it if it 's sounding more natural 
Yeah 
and we know it 's on eh 
I don't know how long it 's been on 
Yeah 
I know 
But it 's some people do sound unnatural when they if they know a tape recorder 's there 
Yeah sure 
Or we just sound unnatural anyway 
Well you might do 
D' you like my ring 
It 's a tadda uh a claddagh rather 
Claddagh ring 
Claddagh 
What does that mean 
it 's an Irish it originates from Galway 
It 's really it used to be given as fourteenth-century redding wedding rings and nowadays blokes give it to girlfriends 
And if you wear it that way up it means you 're going out with them 
Incidentally 
Nice innit isn't it 
I had a claddagh ring long before you did 
I 've got it on this necklace 
See 
What 's the stone 
Sapphire and cubic zirconia round the outside 
Yeah 
Sapphire 
Yeah 
And what well where 's the zircon then 
The cubic th the silver bits around the ah the side 
The sparkly bits just round there 
Oh I see 
I don't think that 's a sapphire 
'T is 
She 's bragging 
But then I 've had this about twenty years with the same thing on see 
So 
So 
She 's not bragging 
she was just showing it to me 
I 'm just showing it to him 
I 'm only joking 
Hmm 
Well that 's not a funny joke really at all 
Oh I think so 
Perhaps it isn't 
Perhaps it isn't 
No 
You don't want any tea 
All right 
Uh did you say you 've got a uh a gauze I can put on this 
Yes

Oh dear 
Has it it looks swollen that foot 
It is yeah 
How come 
It was much more swollen two weeks ago when I did it 
I was just on the entrance to the pub and OK leapt over the wall 
But on the other side there was this kerb and I just didn't look 
And it was really painful 
and it all swelled up huge like a big balloon 
luckily it didn't affect me walking or driving or cycling 
This like this movement like this is fine 
that 's out 
badly bruised 
On the way to the pub not on the way back 
Oh dear 
Ssss 
Oh God 
Because when I did that I couldn't walk on my ankle 
Then I had all black black bruising along all along the sides of my he heel 
like that and like that 
Yeah 
I had a lot of bruising in funny places where I didn't expect it 
like I had oh yeah I had the whole swelling up here and bruising all around here 
Yeah yeah 
It has gone down now but 
Did you 
Yeah 
Did you 
Did you put a have one of those tight bandages on it to keep give it support 
Uhm I did for one day but it wasn't much use really 
No 
You didn't have it X-rayed or anything

This is basically a compliment 
Oh you 'd hate air hostessing

You 're right 
I 'd never want to do that 
My mum 's id my mum 's idea 
Never it 's like a glorified waitress 
Waitress 
Glorified 
It 's worse than a waitress 
I know 
I 'd hate it 
reading that uh you know that book you gave me on Stephen that Stephen King book as well 
Oh yeah 
Have you started it 
Yeah the first story 's about 
You star you haven't started the Ben Elton one 
Yeah 
The first story 's about this sort of uhm 
Everyone disappears on an aeroplane except for seven people or something 
Yeah 
What in the the Stephen King one 
Is it good 
yeah I 'm about three quarters of the way through the first story 
I just haven't had time to read it 
What Ben Elton 
Is it one of those stories 
Oh no not Ben Elton 
I haven't started that 
I 'm saving that one 
so it must be 
That 's quite impressive actually saving something and reading Ki Stephen King first 
Oh 
Yeah 
Saving it yeah 
Mm 
Well yeah Stephen King is your major favourite 
Ben Elton second 
Yeah I 've got 
Yeah maybe 
Maybe that was it 
Yeah 
No I was thinking I was saving Ben Elton till after Stephen King but it wasn't 
I don't know 
Mm 
Why did you buy it 
Well this was hoovered yesterday 
I hoovered my bedroom cos Rosie was coming 
Yeah I 'm going to

Did I tell you 
Yes I did didn't I mmm 
Yes it was uh 
Cordon Bleu 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I sai I said to Peter 
my God I I made this fatal mistake of saying to Rosie 
I 'll cook 
crumble 
I was going to get you an Arabic rug you know 
They 've got some nice rugs over there 
You can get me a rug 
A Arabic 
Well they 've got some nice ones there 
Have they 
Yeah 
I got my mum one 
Mm 
Mm 
Peter 
Now what are they like there 
They 're a bit 
Are they the sort of uhm ones with people dancing three-or-four-words 
but they are they are they 're nice rugs 
Some really nice ones 
Yeah 
Mm 
Hundred and eighty quid 
No no no 
You get good quality rug 
How much is that 
You get a good quality rug for about two twenty-five 
Well how much is that in English 
Right that 's thirty-five pounds 
Yeah 
About thirty odd pounds you 'll get what 
And you 
Back home you 'd pay 
Well what you can get out there for about thirty-five back home you 'd pay over double that 
Yeah 
Yeah you would do 
Treble it 
Triple it 
Triple it 
Yeah 
things cheaper 
Is it treble it or triple it 
Depends on what you 're talking about 
Triple the price or treble the price 
Well you can honestly you you know 
Treble I think 
Triple the price 
Triple the price 
I mean I can 
Yeah I don't know 
Look it up 
Triple the price 
You see things like that 
there 're certain things that you can get cheaper out there 
so I mean obviously if there 's anything that you want me to try and get you I can get it cheaper 
What sort of things can you get cheaper 
Oh I don't know 
Some certain electrical goods like I mean like 
I 'm a student now 
Keep telling myself 
So what 's happening to this tape actually 
Well what happened is right the English uh 
to my parents and my brother on the tape 
You should have seen 
Honestly they 're arguing like anything on Trivial Pursuit questions at the end of the ta 
la Manche 
The French call it la Manche you know 
I said 
well what they mean is the English Channel 
and I 
But well he was arguing the fact that what do the French call la Manche they call it la Manche you know 
Yeah 
The Channel yeah 
Yeah 
It 's true 
Yeah 
And then of course he uh 
This is a game John 
Yeah 
No no 
But you can say the other way what do what do the French call uhm la Man 
What is it in English that the French call la Manche 
Yeah but the question didn't say that 
And he was arguing that the question is really badly worded and therefore he should get it right if he says la Manche 
Yeah but but you 
Yeah but the French 
And the answer is the Channel 
Do you miss David then 
The other 
She was so sweet 
My grandmother was really uhm helpful 
Who was 
You told her all about it then 
Yeah I did 
I had on the Monday night 
And it was like you know she wasn't eighty-three years old 
she was you know 
And she was just saying 
oh yes well you know you must get over it as best as you can 
it 's not the end of the world and stuff 
And I said I know 
so I was you know I said it was well Monday when I went to work I said it was a week two weeks ago yeah two weeks ago last Monday 
But I kept on feeling wobbly all day you know and I kept on feeling really miserable and thinking but you know 
I thought 
God this is if I 'm feeling like this because this is the first person that 's really 
I 'll be I 'll have a nervous breakdown 
I know 
It 's more humiliation I think when you walk up an aisle 
Oh both both 
Oh yeah 
Yeah 
Both 
Can you imagine how awful 
Mm 
Yeah 
My guess is sort of it was on the horizon and they just seemed when he came back from America that 
Sorry 
I mean he 's got he 's got a lot of problems at work and with the gipsies and everything hasn't he so 
Mm 
So 
But did it start start to go wrong when he came back from America then 
No 
as you said yeah that it was more uhm it was more gradual than that 
As he said to me well we didn't seem to be going anywhere fast 
Gradual 
He said that He said that 
He said that 
So 
and I didn't 
and I I felt like turning round and sort of saying well 
you know well whose fault is that 
You know I 'm trying 
what 's he doing 
And he admitted to being lazy 
you know in a relationship it takes two 
You too have to work at a relationship 
It 's not easy 
Must be your bloody fault 
This is a brilliant film 
You what 
What 's it called 
Truly Madly Deeply 
He died but he 's come back as a ghost and they sort of fall in love again 
But it 's really it 's very good 
Oh 
OK 
What 's the Spielberg one that one that is the a-few-words-while-yawning 
When 's that on then 
Is it on T V or a film 
I dunno don't know 
They 're showing them soon 
it 's still on at the cinema I think but I don't know why they 're showing it on tel television 
It 's still on at the cinema 
Where 're you going to Tiggy

Yeah 
I saw it years ago 
Penny 
my friend Penny 
And we loved it and I 'm going to 
I sat there twice 
Watched it twice 
we cried so much 
It 's just really sad 
It 's brilliant 
Love Story 
Really oh ah 
Is it 
Psychoanalysis 
Yes 
Is it 
Mm 
Oh this is The Medusa Touch that Ian 's taping 
Is he is he is he taping it now 
Yes he is 
It 's not It 's not

No 
You just fiddled with the machine didn't you 
shit 
Are you sure it 's taping 
It is taping 
Yes 
It is taping 
The red button 's on 
No wonder I couldn't take it out 
flashing 
No 
But it is on 
It 's definitely on 
That 's the same as it is with mine 
you don't you don't see the counter going round 
There 's no counter 
The same as my one 
Exactly what it does 
Yeah good 
What 
it 's the same model 
Uhm very similar 
I didn't hear it go on though 
It 's very quiet 
Oh I know 
I know this 
I 'm sure Richard Burton stars in this 
I think 
No what was the one that 
a plane crash or something 
uhm 
and he starts making things happen 
uhm and his power grows so much that he starts to blackmail people 
But I 'm sure it is 
I 'm sure it 's the one Medusa Touch 
Did we see it before The Medusa Touch 
I 've never seen it 
I 'm sure it is 
You can borrow the last one 
Yes Richard Burton 
Yes 
Yes Richard Burton 
He has He has He has psychic abilities 
he influences certain things 
Yes 
Yes 
You 're right 
Oh 
Who 's killing who 
Who 's killing who 
Pity the sound just 
did hit him 
I can't remember 
but he 
Well uh that 's part of it that punished 
It 's a good film 
isn't it 
It 's a bloody good film 
It is 
It is 
It 's very good 
It 's actually very very spooky 
It 's not spooky spooky but uhm 
better be taped 
I don't I don't mind at all 
Rather than start watching it at eleven o'clock 
Oh god it isn't is it actually 
a quarter to eleven 
It 's actually very good 
Hasn't it a good ending 
yes it has 
It has got a good ending but you kind of think oh no it 's not you know 
Gordon Jackson 
Yeah 
Derek Jacobi 
Yeah 
It 's a good It 's what I 
don't worry 
What 's on the other side 
Oh look 
This is uh Brazil 
Oh God Brazil 's just as depressing 
Oh The Boys from Brazil 
Oh Brazil one 
Yeah 
It 's It 's futuristic 
It 's set in the future 
I never saw it though 
Was there 
Mm 
Uh it 's very difficult to understand 
Oh my God 
Oh there are the boys getting out as well 
No because they take like it 's set in the year two thousand where the State controls 
And he works in the information technology 
He works oh like all markers 
It is i It 's very good but it 's such a 
Have you seen it before Caroline 
I have never seen it 
it 's weird 
It 's just so 
Mm 
I 've heard of Boys from Brazil but I 've never heard of Brazil 
No no 
Boys from Brazil 
Did you ever see Nineteen Eighty-Four 
I I walked I walked out 
Oh that awful death when they fell through the window through the glass 
Little Clare and I just swept out of the film 
Was it about a school 
Futuristic 
there 's a big man 
there 's 
there 's 
There was someone watching over them or something 
They had to 
Very regimented very dull 
I can't remember that 
What 
Yes 
It was George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-Four made into a film 
Hurt 
John Hurt 
Did you see that one with Arnold Schwartzenegger Total Recall 
That 's a strange film 
No I haven't seen that 
I want to see that 
Very good film actually 
Have you seen Kindergarten Cop yet 
It 's brilliant 
I think he 's very good actually 
I really like him 
And Twins 
Yeah 
Total Recall is definitely a film to watch 
It 's terribly exciting 
Yeah 
You have to watch that Yeah you have to watch that twice because it 's got such backwards and forwards 
Oh yes it 's such a strange film 
Kindergarten Cop was lovely 
Yes 
It is 
Very good 
three-or-four-words 
Yeah 
And look 
Mhm 
Like Bugsy Malone isn't it 
Yeah 
That new film with Joey Jodie Foster 's looks quite good 
Man Tate or something 
I like her 
She 's great 
I want to see that one uh Frankie Frankie and 
Jo Johnnie 
So you 're primarily going to see her 
Well now I am 
about that actually 
I 'd always wanted to go to Australia 
But something happened 
And I don't this is the big thing I don't know 
I felt we had to break up and that we just couldn't stay together 
and sort of our sex life disappeared 
transpacific and transatlantic 
It was all by the phone and stuff 
Couldn't explain it 
stressful but we never got to hate each other 
It 's never been like that 
after all these years it 's sort of slowly taking its course 
I still can't let go 
I keep 
Oh I suppose it 's a question lots of people ask each other 
we could ever get back together again 
D' you really think 
And he said well I don't know 
You can never say that 
And I suppose you can't 
Mm 
Yeah 
Mm 
Mm 
So he was over at Christmas when you spoke to him 
Mm 
No 
I spoke to him because I always speak to him at Christmas and birthdays 
I mean they 've really become sort of about my family sort of thing 
Mm right 
Yeah 
And you asked him whether he thought that you might get back together 
Yes 
Yeah 
I was sort sort of asking him again 
I don't think I do because I nearly emigrated to Australia and then I didn't 
I started to think did it 
this is when everything sort of started for the second time just started going wrong 
It 's not really Jeremy 
But Jeremy was always there in the background 
Only I I wonder 
I don't know 
because it happened so soon afterwards 
Only sometimes I think since we 've 
I was only twenty-four or something 
my feelings 
Yes 
Yeah 
Mm 
People always 
No I 've 
Perhaps from home I 
We had a very loving relationship but it wasn't everything you know 
he wanted physical love as well and I couldn't give that 
That 's the big problem 
Well I suppose that I because I mean there are people who do have platonic relationships 
but I didn't know why 
Yes 
You didn't want sex 
and I I don't I wouldn't want to live with someone who I didn't have any sex life with 
I 'd prefer to have everything 
I don't believe 
Oh so it wasn't that you were disinterested in sex 
Jeremy 
You see that 's happened on and off with John and then I sort of panic and think oh my God it 's happening again 
It 's you know 
Uhm 
Yeah 
which presumably means it 's on again 
Well it 's only a year but it 's sort of go goes off for several months 
I don't But I don't understand 
you resume the sexual relationship 
going 
You say you were working very hard 
you know wh what 's going on in your mind 
What 's the matter 
Mm 
Yes 
But with Jeremy I never spoke at all 
Didn't realise 
I sort of like shut up shop 
Probably had my periods 
Probably very weary 
a little while and after a few months it sort of started to come out 
And then I just never spoke about it 
even touch each other I mean even put our arm around each other and sort of I always moved away 
It 's quite a lot of 
You know what are you doing 
what are you 
I don't think I 'm quite against it 
protect myself almost 
but I don't know what from 
for the moment 
Jeremy and Jane and where that 's going 
at a conscious level but enough to ask him 
Yeah 
I remember at Christmas because that that seems 
I get I was used to describe them to Heather as like panic attacks 
I get really panicky 
And oh God I 've lost everything 
I 've lost everything 
And then I 'd make a phone call to Australia just sort of on the pretext of 
Then I always have this thing about 
I really uh 
And it 's funny 
I suppose it 's because it 's so final 
they 're untouchable 
although I don't consciously work like that 
But subconsciously you think 
I mean it 's that sort of thing 
I never wanted to get married so it 'd be quite a big thing 
So if someone else got married I 'd think gosh maybe he must 
it would mean quite a lot to the children 
So if someone else got married I 'd think gosh maybe he must 
it would mean quite a lot to the children 
Yeah 
Yes 
he didn't really want to come to England again 
and I didn't really at that stage want to move to Australia 
It was almost conveniency or something 
cos what else could we do 
I suppose we had to get engaged now because it 's the only way we 're going to see each other 
strange 
it doesn't give you any particular rights 
You 've got to get 
If you 're going to get married it was sort of all right 
stepped out at the last minute 
But I did it really badly 
Sure 
confirming your status in Australia 
that is a reason to want to get married 
Not the most romantic reason in the world but 
I didn't like it there 
Philippa got all excited 
and oh where will you get married over here 
oh God I can't 
Probably that 
People would say you 've just got cold feet but it was more than that 
It was really a sort of panic 
I thought I couldn't stop it 
It was getting 
Yes 
Yes because I had to 
stress but 
that it would have caused when you got married 
Oh I think so 
Yes 
we would have both been very unhappier 
for me 
I don't know how Jeremy felt inside 
but for me I would have felt unhappy enough 
the physical s the physical relationships 
Mm 
Somehow it doesn't fit for you 
You You pull away 
close 
instinctively pull away 
with John 
reason of realising 
Mm 
Yeah 
And people always seem to say things like 
Well now as far as I know I 've never been raped or anything 
some of my girl friends sort of describe it sometimes 
But that 's sometimes how I feel 
almost as if he was trying to violate me 
It 's horrible 
Mm 
than raping 
Not everybody who is who is experiencing what you are experiencing has had to have been raped 
You know it really upsets me and I don't know why 
of doing anything abusive to you 
through 
I 'll stop and won't go any further 
not too bad really with my 
Anyway what can one expect 
Yes 
No 
Do you go out regularly or or 
And not then if it 's a nasty day 
Yes 
Because at the moment you don't have any help at home do you 
No 
Never had any 
I don't need it yet 
No 
But 
You don't need it at the moment 
I 'll be grateful if you lay it on when I do 
So you 're not at the stage of needing uh meals on wheels or anything like that 
Oh no no no no 
No no 
You do your own cooking 
Yes always 
Yes 
just a sandwich at lunchtime usually 
I do uh definitely have one properly cooked meal freshly cooked meal a day 
Yes 
Yes 
In the evening 
Yeah 
That 's good 
I mean I think it 's essential 
I don't always feel I 'm like eating it or wanting it but I do it 
Yeah 
Yes 
It 's lower than last time 
Hm 
It 's lower than last time 
Is it lower 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Does that mean we can drop some of the tablets 
Probably not 
No 
No 
I need the whole lot 
indigestion ones 
OK 
And I need s sixty of those because I take one every night 
Well I used to get it very badly at night but if I take one of these tablets it 's they help 
How 's your sister 
Well touch wood 
she 's quite a bit better 
about seven months that she 's been all right so 
Is that a longer period than usual 
I 'm frightened every day when I ring her 
getting on really 
So far so good 
Yes 
Yes 
That 's right 
in the ambulance 
OK 
What 's the problem 
Well I was I was passed to you from my doctor up in Rutland 
uhm and it 's progressively caused slight breathing problems 
Yes 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Is that what they called it 
Yes 
And you suffer from mild asthma is that right 
That 's right 
I Well it it sort of relates to hay fever 
And And it 's not helping at all any more 
during the summer uhm that brings on the asthma 
they 've been unable to find out what it is 
So I was breathing through my mouth 
So I was getting a sore throat 
I had my tonsils removed 
Uhm 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
A sore throat 
Well how old were you when the tonsils were taken out 
in January 
This year 
And that was at home 
Hospital 
OK 
E N T hosp specialist and uh see what they can do about it 
right 
Now uh the rest of your health is OK 
I mean are you generally well 
I feel fine 
Uhm the the virus seems to have cleared up but I have last couple of weeks I 've been having a lot of trouble 
before the summer 
Did they do blood tests to see whether you had glandular fever 
Uhm but he he said there were further tests 
And so it didn't seem worth 
It was negative was it 
Well glandular fever tends to run its own course 
There isn't anything actually you can do about it 
That 's right 
Yeah yeah 
and 
Yeah 
It doesn't hurt you to swallow 
No 
Not at all 
and they 'll have a look and see if you need the operation 
Mm mm mm 
Right 
Right 
And I 'll be sent to sent to this address yeah 
Sent to Ramsey yes 
OK 
You 're going away for Christmas presumably

Are you still having the tremor 
Yes 
Right 
Yes 
Most certainly 
It 's And it 's there nearly all the time or or 
Yeah all the time 
All the time 
All the time except 
Like what 
Yes 
Things like that 
Well like changing a plug or something like that 
Changing a plug 
Yeah 
That 's all right 
in the drawing classes 
Yeah 
Yeah 
So you avoided art and things at school 
Yeah 
Because of this you mean or 
No 
No 
Yes 
Now what are you studying 
doing archaeology 
Yeah 
But uh 
What because of infections and things 
Yeah 
It 's colds 
Yeah 
Uhm I think that 's just being with so many people 
But you haven't been in the past in hospital for anything 
No 
Now your parents are they alive and well

Have you any brothers or sisters 
I 've got a sister 
How old is she 
What does she do 
And also well 
Have you ever uh taken any sort of medical advice about this before about the tremor 
You haven't 
No 
It 's quite noticeable isn't it 
Nails are a bit battered 
What happens 
Do you chew them 
and see whether that whether there is anything significant about it 
I think probably the it 's what 's called an idiopathic tremor which just comes on has no obvious cause 
So I 'll do that 
and they 'll send you an appointment at your address 
college 
That 's all right 
Uhm I won't be there over Christmas 
No

Bye 
Bye 
The greatest bullfighters of all have had to be gored 
that is what I think 
John wrote something once about what I did 
he plays very close to the horns you know 
that 's 
You you in war you play on the horns you know 
You 're not the sword after all 
you know 
The matador in a way is a glamorous figure he 's a 
he 's dressed 
kind of image you know 
There is a theatre in war you know 
there is a theatre 
there is no question 
there as an entertainment you know 
as a tragedy you know 
so there is an element of of theatre because the they 're all element elements 
There are many icons in the war you know 
there are many scenes of religious depictions of people cradling the dying people praying people 
even me you know and I 'm the greatest atheist of all time knows when to become the Judas four-words-and-laugh 
You know I 'm not a religious person but I do remember a certain religious instructor at school about the cock crowing you know when those mortars came 
and I used to kind of say you know please t please God get me out of this 
real scary 
revisit the past 
one twenty mortars used to be walking towards you 
asking a lot of questions 
You 'd say you know hang about what 's this why am I here this 
Is this photography you know 
it was part of a learning 
that 's what it was wasn't it really 
It was part of a learning 
Exactly 
Yes 
Yeah 
There are a number of things 
You must be running out of time 
I 'm sorry it 's gone on so long 
Are you cold 
It 's freezing 
Can we go upstairs 
Is that 
Yes go upstairs 
My still life studio is as big as this room actually 
If I had that light coming the way you 've got it here I 'd be doing it all the time 
but what happens is I 've have to put the stuff against the wall and get back the other side 
a nightmare 
One of my favourite photographers is a great 
He does he is a sort of artist photographer 
and he had a hole in the banisters and he used to shoot through one room through the hole into the other 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Roof 
Oh I see 
I know he 's uh 
he 's got my sympathy really 
you know 
but on the other hand you 've got to keep a certain amount of stubbornness to keep the energy going 
You know I 've got injuries to my leg my arm 
I can't carry things with my arm 
I can't sleep properly ever cos I when I go to bed at night I I have to st my arm won't straighten you see 
so I lay in bed at night 
and I 've got an arm that 's like like that you see 
And he sits there with Bill Wyman 
and uh he sits there with Bill Wyman you see and that 's it 
and they actually asked you to get out of it did they 
Yes it is 
yes 
Uh that 's right yeah 
but it 's uh 
Who was that Johnny Gold the owner 
Yeah so that was uh you know 
So uhm you know that 
I would have wished I just 
I wish I 'd just gone up to him 
and like are you Terry O'Neill 
One of the happiest memories in my life 
Bastard 
even worse 
I 've done it for you haven't I 
I mean you know 
slagging me 
You see he was he tried to pull my mate 's wife one night in Tramps 
My my mate Peter is married to Cleo Goldsmith one of the Goldsmith family right and he says to 
Terry pulled her aside and said why are you with these two 
And I 'm supposed to be one of his mates 
And why are you with these two 
And she came back and told her husband you see 
She said you know 
and then and then he rang me up and I wouldn't answer the phone and I picked it up and said you 've been telling people I 'm fucking weak you know 
and uh we broke up 
but instead of uh keeping away he was like 
It was costly mind you but it was like 
after that was about eighteen months ago 
and d' you know what 
the papers have been ringing up this week about it saying 
I just want to confirm uh uh about you and Terry O'Neill 
and I said hang on a minute why are you bothering me about this 
He he said said did you 
I said I 'm not saying anything to you about my private life I said 
and I don't know what you 're talking about anyway 
I said and if you call yourself a journalist I said 
He said oh I 'm a journalist 
So if you 're a journalist go and do some real fucking journalism then 
He said I didn't pick this phone up to be insulted 
How dare they 
I mean that 's 
It 's the most bizarre statement 
I mean what 
So so what happened is you shot you shot a 
Boy 
Sorry I 'm not a great lover of dogs 
Shall I lock him up 
No no don't lock him 
don't take offence about my snub rejection 
it 's just 
Uhm so you shot a job that he did that they didn't like then 
They didn't like his pictures yeah but then I did the pictures 
but the record it was a record company 
and the record company said why 're you doing it 
Terry O'Neill has done it you know 
Mmm oh you mean the pop group didn't like it 
No no they they didn't they did Terry O'Neill 's session and it was such garbage they got him to reshoot 
But like the record company then refused to pay me without having seen the pictures 
As if that that would sort of uh 
which is uh 
but don't mind that 's uh that that 's that that 's a part 
that 's part of 
I mean uh that that being a professional in that profession is like it 's the bottom 
It 's the absolute 
They 've used his picture yeah 
That was probably the record company 's decision 
It 's not worth arse-licking all round 
I mean it 's the big arse-lickers uhm 
It 's 
I mean I I I realise that like in some respects it 's the only way of quite a few years of my life 
you know I 'm open to change 
and so that 's 
Well you will 
How old are you 
you 're not very old anyway 
Twenty-nine 
I mean you know twenty-nine 
He 's totally uncompromising though in the way he approaches towards other people 
it 's 
Yeah but I am too 
you see I wouldn't compromise myself 
smoking last year Mark George the guy who does all my gets me work hasn't got much lately 
forty grand 
and boy did I need forty grand 
who doesn't you know 
a car rally 
and I thought hang on what 's this all about 
Who 's going to pay for it 
I said it 's not to do with cigarettes is it 
He said I don't know I 'll get back to you 
Of course he knew 
you know he doesn't get 
He 's not going to say he knew 
and he came 
and he said are you were right about that 
and I said no I 'm not doing it you know 
were before 
Yeah 
Mmm 
Has to be cigarettes yeah 
But I have this this little shit 
I feel like doing all the windows when I leave you know 
Oh my God 
shit 
So we were rambling away downstairs 
It was extraordinary what you went through to to get the picture in those circumstances 
Oh yeah Beirut 
and then maybe look at the index 
Is there an index 
Mm 
There is 
and all the chapters are selfcontained as well 
Oh yes 
So it should be fairly easy 
You needn't read every chapter 
This is something that Diane was saying that there 's so much work that 's got to be done that uh we we won't have time to read any books unless we particularly want to read the books 
The best thing to do is to is to turn straight to the index and look through the index then then look through the pages that you know are contained in the index 
Yeah 
The intro 's extremely readable on that 
Mm 
I think that 's probably what I 'll do 
Ah this is a good bibliography in here 
So what 's your essay 
Yeah 
I might like to write something on Mortmann as well 
Mhm 
No 
That 's my stuff 
I was quite happy with that 
I was quite pleased when I knocked that out 
I thought I 'd done quite well 
Oh it 's awful when you 're pleased with something and 
Yeah but it 's only a phase 
I think that 's a bit unfair 
Kathy and Juliet and everybody got B or B plus 
I was quite disappointed 
Mm 
Mm 
Yeah 
You may think you know like B minus 
I was awfully disappointed 
but it got us quite a good grade 
Yeah 
and you did as well 
took the wrong approach really 
Mm 
Yeah 
Yeah 
There 's only six 
Only do six essays not twelve 
Mm 
Well 
So that 's going to be one 
Well you 've done one already 
Schleiermacher or whatever his name is 
I 've done one mm 
Schleiermacher 
Schleiermacher 
according to your Mum 
Oh 
Oh right 
That 'll be one 
I 'd uh like to do one on process 
Like to do something on Mortmann 
Is The Myth of God Incarnate a dangerous book if I thwack somebody over the head with it 
We haven't we haven't Yeah we haven't done that one yet 
How about liberation theology used as a Marxist analysis of society 
Yes that one w that would be quite an interesting one to do 
As it 's a major conceptual tool 
Mm 
Which I Which reminds me I 've got I 've almost finished this book 
I 'll I 'll hand it on over to you 
Oh you have 
God Language and Scripture 
It 's really quite interesting 
Very interesting 
I forget which one it is now 
sort of as it would be spoken rather than literary Greek 
Forget which one it was now 
Oh 
Mark 
Either that one or Matthew or Luke 
Rather you than me 
There are some of these things we 've not come across yet 
What do you think the term anamne anamnesis means 
Got any idea 
I think so 
Well that 's ideal you see 
If you put that it I 've no idea you 've actually answered the question 
You can't even say it 
Mm 
Yes 
It doesn't actually say what is it 
It says what what do you think 
you 've got to say uh what do you think in in a thousand words or in fifteen hundred words 
Oh mm 
I could probably do that in a thousand words 
Yeah well 
Mm 
and the unfamiliar word I would deduce that I had very little knowledge of this subject 
on and on and on 
you could bring uh Irish myth into it somehow as well 
And on and on and on 
Yes I could 
Yes 
According to Irish legend 
You 're going to be transcribing all of this are you 
Some poor little soul 's got to do it 
nasty words then 
We 're not to mention We 're not to ment mention the fact the tape recorder 's on or it ruins things 
And talk fairly quickly yeah 
Really 
Oh 
What 
were you told that 
Oh 
A tad unfortunate 
Mm 
Never mind 
an essay 
that required 
I don't think if it was just Schleiermacher 
Oh yes 
Indicate with examples how the theology of Ewige Mortmann has been influenced by major events of the twentieth century 
Feminist theology 
A major event of the twentieth century 
Yeah 
She has been influenced by that 
The book that 
two books sold as one 
Yes 
Mm 
Yes 
It 'd be interesting to look at 
Yes 
This fellow Mortmann was was really was quite heavily influenced by twentieth century 
It 's a shame they haven't got anything on Bonhoffer on the uhm 
Yeah 
Cos there was that book of uhm letters and papers from prison 
Your essay list 
Letters from Prison 
Yes 
Yes 
But uh was it in that little book you had yesterday 
when his daughter was married 
Yeah 
Yes 
It was very good wasn't it 
Yeah 
That 's it 
Yeah 
That 's it 
Yes 
Bonhoffer was uhm a theologist during the last war in Germany and he died at one of the camps 
against the Hitler regime 
He died in one of the concentration camps 
Yeah 
And this book Letters from Prison is sort of what copies of letters from he wrote when he was in the camp 
Amazing yeah yeah yeah 
Mm 
Oh yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yes 
As they do in South Africa 
It 's amazing 
That 's right 
Yes exactly 
It makes it sound as if it 's not your idea but sort of a high authority 's idea 
That 's what it 
Yeah 
Mm 
Mm mm 
Yeah 
That 's right 
Yeah yeah yeah 
He told me 
Yes yes 
It 's very easy to to do that really 
They do it in South Africa don't they 
Mm 
Some of them 
I think 
The whites being the the master race 
one of his sons was 
The The popular thing is that Noah had three sons and one was white one was black and the other was Asian 
Everyone 's descended from these three sons 
Mm 
Oh 
That 's right 
Yeah 
Mm 
Was it Ham Jaseth and 
And She Shem Ham and Japeth 
semitic and Ham was supposed to be the descendant of Africans and Japeth 's the European 
But uh Ham did something wrong and he was cursed by his father and told he would be the servant of his brother 
This is the excuse that 's used in South Africa as sort of for white superiority 
What was it 
Shem Shem Shem yes 
Mm mm mm 
It was probably used in the Southern States as well 
Yeah 
Probably used in the Southern States as well 
Yeah 
Yeah 
You can justify anything 
I mean there 's a lot of uhm people justify anti-female behaviour through theology which you know if you actually read into it it 's a load of nonsense 
Yeah 
That 's right yeah 
but 
It 's like 
if you try hard enough you can justify anything can't you 
You can justify anything through 
Yes 
Well yes 
That 's right 
Which reminds me 
apparently 
well I say apparently theology is a Greek 
well it 's a Greek deriv derivative 
Apparently the theo is a male god 
The study of of a male God 
and logy is words of or is about 
so words about God 
but it it 's it 's a male God 
Some of the feminist theologians male or female have been saying they 're not theologians at all 
Yes 
Mhm 
Yes yes 
Thealogians 
Yes 
Thealogians 
Yeah 
Mm 
Which doesn't occur in the Hebrew 
is neutral 
Yes 
Yes 
The trouble is in English you can't say it without appearing offensive 
You 've got to say he or she 
That 's right 
Yeah 
That 's right 
That 's not 
Mhm Mhm 
Apparently the uhm American theologians nowadays always use inclusive language 
They don't talk about God as being he or she 
rather than use another word 
Yeah 
Mhm 
That 's what We were doing that in linguistics actually 
to use the w meaning of the word their has changed 
Somebody 's left his coat when it 's obviously a male or a female coat 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
That 's right 
Yes 
No 
Mm 
Yeah 
Somebody 's left his coat 
Yeah 
Yeah 
That 's funny cos I was reading somewhere that historically if you said someone has left his coat you could mean male or female 
Yes when you say 
Oh 
It 's still a little bit like that in Welsh isn't it 
Cos with Welsh they are a few numbers there used to be parallel sets of masculine and feminine numbers 
but there 's just a rump now 
two three and four now have got masculine and feminine forms 
if it 's female then you always use the female number 
Yeah 
There 's t two three and four 
Have masculine and feminine forms 
It 's very odd 
Mhm 
Yes but in French 
I remember learning French 
numbers 
And they said you know 
if it 's an all female set it 's the feminine 
male 
then it 's the male 
one man 
They said well it 's it 's it 's a masculine 
All the girls went aargh it 's not fair Miss 
Mm 
Didn't realise it was the same in French 
Ah 
Yeah 
Mm 
One man 
Yeah that 's 
Yes 
is it 
Yes 
Something like that 
Yeah 
you know when people say in a yuck way oh I 'm just like sisters with my daughter 
we tell each other everything 
I try and be kind of open with them so that they don't feel excluded 
It was a sort of openness and and like now I think one of the freson reasons our Fran who 's fourteen actually finds us so boring 
She makes it perfec She 's not rebellious or difficult or anything but she obviously finds Chris and me terribly dull 
It 's rather sort of lowering 
But one of the reasons is that she doesn't have anything to feel threatened about because we are completely open with her uhm 
apart from the fact Chris might be abroad or we might have people to supper or whatever 
but basically we 're just sitting here having spaghetti and reading the Evening Standard 
and it 's all the same 
uh or uh uh 
that she 's not excluded from anything 
uhm because sex is the one thing you are excluded from 
and you see in Franny 's case presumably presumably she thinks that we don't make love any more because of c course adolescents never think that grown-ups make love 
so she doesn't even have to worry about that 
that 's all over and in the past 
she knows that it 's not over and in the past 
I mean that 's a large part fifty per cent of why you 're together which is healthy 
but she can't see it 
and I don't know how you overcome that one 
And then now even you went and saw a psychiatrist 
but that might not be for another two or three years 
Uhm uhm uhm 
uhm 
uhm 
Uhm uhm uhm 
Uhm uhm yes yes 
uhm uhm uhm uhm 
uhm uhm 
uhm 
uhm uhm 
uhm 
No 
uhm uhm uhm 
Well easily yes 
No I don't think it will necessarily 
I don't see why it should because you don't flaunt your sexuality 
uhm 
yes 
You mean because she doesn't like Gavin it might turn her against men 
But she likes Bernard 
Yes yes I think that 's probably the thinking 
I think she likes men 
And as she grows up she 'll see that her dislike of Gavin is irrational even if she can't admit it 
thrusting in in 
you know she she probably is pro 
in it when she hates being in it and you know I 'm thinking 
how selfish she was not to want you to be happy 
but that won't be for a while 
Not for a while no no 
should have their family unit as their centre of their life which of course children who go to boarding school don't have 
presumably if she is saying 
no I don't want to go to boarding school 
and yet you see she 'd have such a lot of fun there because she wouldn't have to think about you and Gavin and Bernard which is actually rather boring for her 
She would have all her friends 
to a mixed school at sixteen like King 's Canterbury where Fran 's going 
or weekly 
uhm uhm 
Oh I see that yes uhm 
uhm uhm uhm uhm 
Weekly boarding at Westminster 
No I don't think Westminster 
Don't you 
I think there 's a compromise 
like Fran 's going to King 's Canterbury and I may be proved wrong where I think there are boys and they do all go out to supper in large groups on Saturday night that I think the atmosphere is much less sexual 
why are you against it 
Uhm uhm 
Uhm 
is it uhm 
But anyway 
King 's Canterbury is being spoken of very highly at the moment 
It 's flavour of the month 
there must be something wrong with it 
It really is 
isn't it 
I wonder what it is 
Yes 
Well I think o 
was there 
that 's the wonderful thing about it but it 's an awfully long time ago 
I think ho 
and nor is it too stiff like Rugby where uh if y 
the girls are just treated like a few honorary girls but they 're not integrated 
At King 's Canterbury they are integrated but it isn't too free 
it 's still quite academic 
They 're They 've all gone for a reason 
Uhm 
uhm uhm 
uhm 
uhm uhm 
uhm 
Yes uhm 
Yes that 's a nasty thought isn't it because nobody is going to go there if they 're happy at their own school 
It 's true 
Not if they 're blissfully happy 
Fran is very happy at Cheltenham 
so that 's not such a bad reason 
she just wants a change 
uhm 
uhm uhm 
uhm yes that that seems 
where Franny went and everybody said you couldn't possibly send a normal well-adjusted girl to Trevor Roberts 
uhm uhm uhm 
Well they were all oddballs but what 's the the dividing line between an oddball and an eccentric and that 's what 's wonderful about Trevor Roberts 
but in the best possible way 
that it will have some of that 
If you could get that across to her 
but you wouldn't be sending her there 
You wouldn't be sending her and then she 'd have such a wonderful time 
because if they 
I mean I know it sounds awful 
they wear gowns 
i 
it is rather 
uhm uhm 
uhm uhm 
uhm 
uhm 
uhm uhm 
Good point 
uhm 
uhm 
uhm 
uhm uhm 
uhm 
outside the the school or whatever 
I agree 
Actually King 's Canterbury is a bit restrictive 
and Franny doesn't like this thought 
so I 'm 
uh is a bit restrictive 
Fran was a bit depressed when she heard that I was too but 
uhm 
temporary prejudice 
hasn't it 
The re The reason for it is I think that when they 're walking round the school so are thousands of tourists 
and they are slightly on show 
and I think they 're just saying 
OK you 're not in uniform 
but we 're not having people slopping around 
and so therefore they 've drawn a few lines 
but I think they 'll drop it anyway 
Oh 
yes 
Oh it 's silly 
We 've got some friends coming to supper whose daughter 's there so I can question tomorrow so I can question her about it 
I mean I th I mean obviously people other people have said this to you 
that would be the solution for Nell wouldn't it to get away 
uhm 
Yes I think that 's probably right 
being 
I mean she 's throwing herself into school at the moment and she had she 's got a little circle of friends that she absolutely clings to but I 'm not terribly sure that they 're the best thing for her 
really very proper and very sober and very conscientious hard-working little bunch 
and they just leave Nell a little bit behind so that she 's always got something to aspire to uhm in terms of maturity 
But she must be clever 
uhm 
uhm it 's just they 're more swotty 
they 're a bit more into boys 
and Nell isn't quite sure what all that 's about yet 
but I think she 's getting inklings 
and they sort of zipped her up on her dress I mean really you know took her out of herself and her rather old-fashioned ideas 
So she 's playing a part 
Yes she 's playing a part 
Yes 
And I don't think that 's healthy at all 
Very tiring 
could be tiring 
Yes yes 
Oh she is she is punishing herself 
Yes 
So I don't know 
I 'm I 'm not quite sure 
proved that she was never going to be the easy adolescent was she 
and it might have been something else 
so if this might have happened even if you and you know Bernard had stayed together 
uhm 
uhm uhm quite yes 
It must be horrid for Gavin 
absolutely horrid 
Cor Helen that 's a healthy lunch 
I know 
She had a uh veggie burger 
Yeah 
How 's how 's your charming housemate 
What 's it like 
It 's nice 
It 's a bit dry isn't it 
What 
It was mostly about the weather 
It was really annoying 
how they 're getting on 
And they seem to be getting on OK 
but she sort of put one short sentence 
and then it was all about how lovely the weather was and how nice everyone 's been to her 
Mm yep 
When was that 
What do you think of the soup 
Was it 
Oh three-or-four-words 
Mmm 
Yes 
Interesting diplomatic 
Ah 
No the veggie burger was this sort of 
I almost went for the pasta thing but 
Yeah 
And uhm 
Well I had chips yesterday and they were delicious 
Mm 
container just as I got there 
They were so hot I burnt my tongue 
Really 
and I 'm sort of looking like snow 
so good 
Sarah says oh God bits of kitchen roll everywhere 
looking really pleased with himself 
Uh so 
Ah 
Ah bless him 
How clever he is 
I came to your flat at the weekend 
I wonder if that 's because the cooks have changed or because uh 
Mm 
I really wanted to look in your room but I didn't 
They 've lowered the budget or something 
Mm 
Oh you should have 
it 's really cool 
Mm 
But that happened after the uhm the drop in standards 
It happened this year in the well within the last six months and the standards dropped in the year before that 
I 'm always like that about rooms 
It wouldn't take much 
Yeah 
I know 
It 's very cheap after all 
You were in London were you 
they changed the cook and then got to the point where they were virtually thinking of closing the restaurant and it changed hands 
Did you have a good time 
Yeah very nice 
Yeah 
and lots of scoffing 
Oh good 
Chatting and not enough house 
What did you scoff 
Chocolate 
No 
I had a really nice Indian meal 
Uhm 
Prawn Korma 
Did you make it 
Uh no 
restaurant 
Amnam goori dresdin dasira ah dadala dada 
What is is it what 's he saying 
Go sinabak dree 
Is it is it drugs 
And all he 's saying is would you like a drink on the house 
but he says it in this really furtive little voice 
Doesn't want anyone else to hear 
What 's he got himself into 
That 's very nice 
Mm 
I love them 
Do you 
What did you do 
For the weekend 
Mm 
I didn't do anything 
I was supposed to be going away 
say he was ill 
being on my own all weekend 
But in fact I had a really nice time 
suppose I have to cook something otherwise I just eat crisps all weekend 
Sorry 
Saturday night 
Watched a video 
Well with Chicken but he 's not much he 's not much good 
quite brave isn't it 
alone from other people 
Well I 'm like that too 
I wouldn't have minded if I 'd known it was going to happen for some weeks and I could have thought about it and I probably would have felt quite positive 
And Sarah didn't come back until Monday either so 
Mm 
Mm 
I expect you 're glad you 're not a vegetarian 
But I saw Darryl you know and that was the main thing 
I normally like veggie veggie burgers 
Mm 
Spicy 
Chick peas and things 
Yeah 
maybe Helen can tell us 
It depends a lot on the actual veggie burger 
Yes 
Yeah 
and 
they go like meat imitations 
and then you get your vegetarian burgers that are much nicer 
and they 're not anything like meat 
and they 've sort of got rice and carrots and things in there 
These are all right but they 're not very spicy though 
Oh god 
They 're horrible they 're 
they 're revolting 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Tasteless 
Or kidney beans are a good base aren't they 
Yeah 
Aduki beans 
They 're wonderful 
Wendy were the best ones I ever had 
Wendy Burgers 
Oh yeah 
Those were wonderful 
What were they cashew nut and and uh parsnip 
They 're really sweet 
They weren't exactly I mean they were more what you might call vegetable burgers weren't they 
They weren't what you a what you expect of a veggie burger 
They were lovely 
What do you mean 
But normally with veggie burgers you did you did you grill them 
dictionary 
Mm 
Yes 
What 's the difference between veggie and vegetable burgers Darryl 
More exotic 
Mm 
Yeah 
fish patties 
Yeah 
Home-made crispy patties 
They call basically they call anything a burger that you slap into a roll 
Mm 
Mm 
A cutlet 
Oh God 
I can't be indifferent about anything called a cutlet 
for tea 
And one day we had turkey cutlets 
They brought it out 
and the girl I was sitting next to 
and they were like you know pre-pack frozen bread orange breadcrumbs 
she cut into it pushed the bits apart and there 's this something stretched from one bit to another and it was I 'd swear to God it was chewing gum 
It was chewing gum in this thing 
And she took it out 
and ever after that their name was turkey gutlets 
and so really horrible 
Mm 
I had sardines once with a fly on it 
I was just about to tuck into it and I noticed this great fly soaked in tomato sauce 
and they they tried to convince me that this fish had swallowed the fly before it died 
I said 
but they live under the sea you know 
you can't have flies under water 
I couldn't believe it 
Wouldn't give me another one 
Oh God 
It isn't that funny 
Oh yeah really 
It 's all added protein 
Yeah 
Yeah 
That 's exactly what they said when we found ants in the salt cellar 
Don't you think ants are a bit different to flies though 
Where did you find ants in the salt cellar then 
Sorry 
Where were you finding the ants in the salt cellars 
Stupid ants 
Mm 
Here 
It was 
No no not here 
At school 
I didn't know they 'd go for salt 
Yeah 
You find little little uhm you shake the salt cellar and there 're little sort of black blobs come out 
and if you look carefully you see the legs start wandering about 
but they 're dead definitely dead 
He said oh no it 's the pepper 
You 're lucky the salt was flowing in my opinion 
Fancy complaining about ants being in it 
Ants absorb the moisture you mean 
What 's this book machine that Paul 's got 
Who 's 
Gary was working on it 
Is he 
Book machine 
brain child isn't it 
Mm 
Yeah 
But what is it 
It 's supposed to have a desk top publishing system on it 
Oh but it 's not the first ever surely 
Mm 
Is that is that all 
It was quite groundbreaking in its time 
So it 's j just soft software is it 
Mm 
That 's a bit crummy 
Mm 
Book machine 
write a program for him yeah and it was quite gr groundbreaking desk top publishing 
It 's a sort of portable office 
Write a program 
I don't think it was necessarily the first 
Oh no 
Well I 'm sure 
I think 
people who have copy and uhm for a magazine they 'd send the copy in 
so they 'd make they typeset it on Book Machine 
headers and figures 
That that that is an aspect of P C uhm which is interesting 
what have I got 
I 've got north London blacks and north London whites south London blacks south London whites 
and uhm in a class of sixteen they they they they 
well they they they they mix in and out mix in enough 
and they the the north London whites and south London whites talk very marginally differently 
You have to listen but but but but it is there and 
yes 
From the blacks 
No no from each other uhm but but but 
to to to each other within the same community they they they talk one way 
When they 're talking to other people within the class within the colour range they talk another way 
they talk another way 
yeah yeah yeah yeah it is just different 
you know and and and 
and whenever when any one of them is talking this is this is what really got me 
and I thought this is uhm you know this this 
this is how teaching really works that when one of them is talking across the class to another as it were via me as as imaginary chair they 're talking in a different way again 
Oh Jesus it 's 
But but nobody except for well apart from the fact that I 'm trying to ginger up understanding cos I said I think uhm 
and I don't want to make them over self-conscious otherwise they 'll just shut up and say nothing but but 
but when it starts off they you know you hear all this enormously complex stuff going on 
and it 's not 
No from each other OK 
Really 
Yes 
Mmm 
Yes I suppose so 
Well well just just feed in some of your tapes and say look this is what you 've got to do 
You 've got to analyse it like this 
than you probably would 
and and and I hear them hear them being different 
Yes rather 
This is exactly what this research 
Yeah i i i it is very odd this whole aspect of code switching 
How would you convince one that he 's being different 
Yes yes 
Mmm 
Mmm 
Oh you said all of them yes mmm 
Mmm 
The sales is a bit weird 
Yeah 
Very odd indeed 
With with with with Dow Jones if you 're sent to London it 's roughly Guadalajara 
Oh they they they they they 're east London wide boys 
right 
It 's not their problem 
I honestly don't think they 've got a problem 
They they revel in it in fact 
This is real total breakdown Lynn because 
It looks like real total excess to me 
Wha wha what what what 's going on here 
Well 
This is 
I mean 
snowy lemons on the top 
And it may be nice without that top or maybe not 
Don't knock it 
It 's not funny 
it 's absolutely delectable 
It 's quite nice it 's quite nice on its own actually 
Well anyway it might conceivably 
But anyhow tha that 's 
So if you feel like uh uhm trying a bit of walnut pastry kind of cake and putting things on it judiciously 
Yes I feel like trying a bit of walnut 
You haven't got any yet 
Oh that yes 
Don't do that 
oh dear 
Mm 
Thank you 
fancy might 
style 
I don't know 
I 'm not actually sure 
It has to be tried though 
Do they come from trees 
They come from trees 
Human beings can eat them 
Just just before 
Mm 
Yes 
Yes 
Yes 
There there there 's a sort of Community Centre tha that hovers uneasily in a disused church halfway between Hampstead and Highgate 
Yes 
A a and you can rent the tea bar for a nominal fee and that means you can rip off the public to a to a disastrous extent and make money for your choir and and and and and it works on the basis 
Mm 
Yes 
Oh yes 
centre of Hampstead 
No it 's not 
up apple and walnut or bloody orange 
Bloody orange or 
Yeah 
orange 
Yeah I saw 
I shall have the dry first liquid second 
I I I shall try that 
whi which has a kind of colour that I was born to appreciate 
I mean I love it 
They have everything 
Well he was brought up on burnt toast 
in India 
and and and and cow dung 
and i i it 's a wonderful colour 
i i it was an area of of of 
it was in in 
Wh 
W what what what you do in in in high Victorian ti in empire times 
Uhm you try to you build Hyde Park in Calcutta little realising you don't get quite as much sort of rain 
Well you do 
there 's a lot of rain in Calcutta but not at the same time as you do in Hyde Park 
and very wonderful too 
on a hill 
Thank you 
Mm 
Yeah 
And the people still play cricket on it 
Oh yes certainly 
Well actually no 
Really 
I suppose they live on it as well but they still play cricket on it 
Oh 
I am sure they do 
Yeah 
Yes 
But I 've seen a recentish picture 
and uhm you know being a a flat space it 's got tents and well not tents but just garages I suppose 
Yes 
Yes 
You didn't 
I was thinking I should 've produced it 
Would you like some 
Oh there 'd certainly have been some sticky plates 
which had all the 
I mean it worked perfectly well 
It 's just that all the indications of temperature had been rubbed off it completely 
Mhm 
yes 
Or worn 
So we had some interesting bread 
Sticky bread 
Varying bread 
Gauge the decision 
Mm 
Oh actually I 've been thinking 
I was thinking 
There hasn't been enough of it actually 
I quite like that 
Mm 
Yes 
Well what happened to it 
Sorry 
Mm that 's a wonderful walnut cake 
This is getting tender isn't it 
Well no thirteen years ago 
thirteen 
Well Nell Nell is not as old as that yeah 
Nell is fourteen 
When did you get married 
Mmm mmm 
Fifteen 
God that came out quick didn't it eh 
for the three months between September and Christmas in seventy-seven 
That that would probably be it yeah 
With Nell 
Yes in Prince 's Gate Mews when it was barely 
I mean it certainly wasn't finished 
Yeah 
Right well there was all that 
Probably all that this year 
one and a bit 
when she she was uhm 
I mean she was 
I might be wrong a bit 
Seventy-seven 
Very probably not 
so it may have been before 
Yeah yeah 
I mean it wasn't just the business of maybe with one baby 
Mmm 
Yeah yeah so it had to be Nell 
and Dick was the next year 
all the way through Dick 's feeding which went on for about two months 
And Nell was born in 
Yeah 
Yes you were in Brunei that year 
I think that 's right 
Oh yes 
Uhm yes 
Yeah 
Oh yeah 
That 's right yes 
I I I I tried 
She 's quite into carpentry 
She does carpentry one-word-shouted 
It was absolutely totally idiotic 
We were trying to get this house ready to to let 
Prince 's Gate 
there wasn't a loo 
A desperate state of affairs 
expected it to be done 
Yeah 
Nothing had been done 
Well obviously they weren't finished 
at Christmas which we weren't going to just take no notice of 
Uhm oh it was ghastly 
Didn't work 
Absolutely 
I think I remember the toilet didn't work 
Mm 
Mm 
Yes oh yes Sue yes 
My my sort of recollection 
There there there was a fault by the time we got there 
That that that was 
Bernard 's sister and my Mum and they worked like blacks 
It was absolutely horrible 
Mm yes 
And and got it into a a a state to to let to yeah 
Yeah 
Ah it 's not practical at all 
Families 
That 's quite different 
Yes 
We wondered whether you would like to have a go at your jigsaw puzzle 
Oh yes 
Because you had you didn't get a go with your jigsaw did you 
Cheers 
Cheers 
It 's a king 
Cheers 
doing it here doesn't it 
What 's that 
The jigsaw 
Thank you 
What have you got 
Sherry 
Mm 
Yeah 
Uhm it 's quite dry actually 
It looks like Amontillado 
Yes 
Well what name 
I think 
They brought me a bottle of Croft 's Original 
Mm 
Which is quite nice and sweet 
Mm 
They 're called Gasser the people next door are they 
Must be a difficult name 
Pardon 
It must be a difficult name to live with 
I suppose it is an unusual name isn't it 
Well they 've just got lots of 
Bits on 
Mhm 
Cheers 
aren't immediately visible 
Happy birthday 
It said 
What 
Yes I did 
No 
Didn't I 
Not on that one 
A message 
Well it wasn't a message 
That was just so that 
What was it on 
I think I said s something like 
No 
It doesn't matter 
You don't need to bother 
Was it 
I can't remember 
It was on one of the little cards on one of the little parcels 
Sorry 
Mm 
here happy last birthday 
This is it is it 
Well I suppose if I lived each year as if it were my last I could enjoy myself couldn't I 
Would you 
I I I as you know quite unconsciously as I wrote it 
Mm 
I say look Sue 's made it pretty 
Yes 
Anyway 
It 's so nice I don't want to destroy the pretty 
Why don't you 
Would you like a knife 
Oh yes 
Just a minute 
Oh come on 
Oh really 
They 're very good cheese straws Nigel 
Are they 
Excellent 
Yes 
I was just going to tell you that I have made a used a different rec slightly different recipe 
Really 
Mhm 
Always a risky thing to do 
In this case the risk paid off 
Yeah 
it seemed to me that they weren't getting any better 
And I thought well perhaps they 're getting worse 
So I then found 
And there was a recipe there so I thought well I 'd try it out 
And when I did I thought it was rather better 
Can't remember what the difference was now though 
Mm 
Mhm 
Mhm 
Well this is very tasty 
Mmm 
It is a bit softer 
Mm 
Well I find 
it 's getting steadily harder your 
Yeah 
the only information I 've ever got 
and I I 'd never get it either 
Nobody ever does make it like she used to make it 
It was all beautiful you know 
They all tell me all the things that the books tell me 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mhm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Sometimes pastry turns out right as far as I 'm concerned and sometimes it turns out wrong 
Comes out beautiful 
Mm 
Well I find it varies 
I am coming to conclude that it must be because I get too much water in it or something 
Mm 
Yes 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Yes 
A lot a lot of water may 
But you see if I don't get enough water in then the blasted stuff won't roll out 
it cracks 
Mhm 
and then you put the water and the eggs in with a quick wizz at the end 
Mm 
uhm one thing I found 
wizz it for longer the same amount of water a small amount of water does the binding for you whereas if you only wizz it for a short time you know then it ends up looking crumbly and you think 
ah more water 
And and and you put more water in and then it can get hard and brittle 
So it seems to exce exceedingly critical that endpoint 
it should come right every time 
Ah 
Yes 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mhm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Well that 's a way isn't it 
I mean 
Mm 
Well as far as I can make out it doesn't make any difference 
It just stays as it was 
Yeah 
No 
fat into the flour 
Yes 
I agree 
Mm 
Maybe 
Yes 
Mm 
There was another thing which made me think that hands can must come into it a lot because from some other recipe 
well it was 
oh no it wasn't 
it wasn't pastry 
and they said 
or rather the other way round 
the oil in the almonds 
Mm 
Yes 
The heat in the hands brings out the oil in the paste 
And uh you know uh uh it 's not a good thing 
Yah 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
So it may be a similar sort of thing with your with your pastry 
put my hands in the pastry I think 
And the other thing is one or two recipes have said categorically 
Maybe I shouldn't do that 
I don't know 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Yeah 
Mm 
I 'm sure that 's it 
Mhm 
Mhm 
Mhm 
I don't think so 
I have had some very good results with soft margarine 
Mm 
and I 'd oh I 'd I 'd just found that you could buy elderflower cordial 
Mm 
Oh yeah 
Yeah 
when I was staying with Anne because she 'd made some 
She used to put a little thermos flask by my bed every night filled with elderflower cordial 
Mm 
How lovely 
Absolutely gorgeous isn't it 
isn't it 
Elderflower water at nighttime 
It was absolutely wonderful 
Yes 
Yeah 
Oh it was lovely 
It was really good 
yes yes 
Yes yes 
Anyway 
Well it was very good 
very good 
Then I was in Sainsbury 's and I thought I 'd have a look 
Sure enough I found some uh elderflower flower cordial flower cordial 
Anyway 
Back to the gooseberries 
could 've been apple pie or a gooseberry pie or something like that 
Mmm 
It rolled beautifully 
It didn't crack 
I got it to the right thickness 
And I managed to get it on the pie 
And it really looked a nice pie 
And I cut some bits out and decorated it 
When I 'd done it all I looked at it 
and I thought 
well that looks jolly good you see 
with water 
and that pastry came out just like a board 
Yes 
Mm 
Mm 
Yeah 
Mm 
Mm 
Oh my God 
She was uh 
She looks she looks 
I don't know where she 's from 
That was 
She looks she looks Puerto Rican or something is it 
That 's not the guy you were talking to 
That was someone else 
No no no that was a groupie 
She kept going up to a woman 
Mmm 
She was 
daughter 
To our right 
Yeah 
And she was playing on the stairs 
Well that it was her Mum 
Sitting nearest to you eventually 
They weren't married though were they 
Yeah 
Were they married 
Yes 
twelve years or something 
They were actually married 
He 's looking very s slim 
Yeah he is 
portly you know 
Doing really well 
Mmm 
Hard to get a decent descaler these days 
But there are 
buttoning her lip 
Button your lip 
like crazy when you put it in in the kettle that that stuff will clean it 
Maybe it 's one of these 
Sort of Alka Seltzer type thing 
Yeah 
Bit of clostic acid 
Bleach 
No no that that 's sulphuric acid 
which practically descaled the whole house 
Really 
But is it no 
not poisonous 
But they are all poisonous 
Mmm 
Mmm 
Yeah 
flat front 
Oh the flat front 
Oh yeah 
no news is good news 
Don't know but I 'll 
He 's a bit impatient this man 
a hell of a long time 
Yeah that 's it 's about it 's about three weeks 
And that 's just to OK a mortgage 
Just to get just to get a go a mortgage off him 
Uhm so I think I think that the fact that no news is good news is uh 
Is good news 
No his news is good news is good news 
imagine it would 
Well 
I mean you usually can 
Well it 's a bit difficult with these accountants 
They 're running out of money 
push you know 
very simple 
they 're more likely to say no just to get rid of me 
I know 
I know 
Mmm 
as a as an alternative really 
so how did the gig sound 
Did it sound all right 
I was playing 
I wasn't listening 
So what 's this thing you 're doing for John Harle is it 
Harle 
Harle 
Who 's he 
He 's just he 's just done the music for that 
you know promotional things and uh 
Uh 
Right 
Mmm 
Yeah 
Last time 
in Aldeborough 
just just staying on a holiday 
lovely Snape 
Mmm 
Mmm 
It 's the most gorgeous place 
Yeah it was good 
you know it 's weird 
There 's there 's quite a lot of jazzy stuff although he and all the solos are wr kind of his solos are written out cos he 's got to do them on his own 
controlled sort of the tone on the sax you know get very high notes and very softly 
he 's very good 
Yeah 
Yeah 
So is he quite well known then 
Well he he 's 
I hadn't heard of him when I first sort of bumped into him uhm 
B B C 
It it was through the B B C wasn't it 
No it was through Lubbock 
Yes but not through the B B C though 
Because Lubbock couldn't do it so they passed it on to me 
Yeah so you 're both doing this one 
Oh we 're both doing this tour yeah 
Where 
All over the country 
Pretty much again Edinburgh Manchester Belfast Cardiff 
Things like that 
Bloomsbury Theatre 
Did that come up before Sarah Jane 
Yeah 
had plays which have been taken on by the B B C or 
Uh I wrote a screen play for the B B C just lately but uhm they they didn't they haven't done it 
They were going to do it but they do that they do that quite a lot 
slots covered 
I started 
Channel Four uhm to write 
I don't know if you remember the She-play series 
So if I had 
they paid but at least they paid for it 
They did they did 
they paid for it but but I think in a way that 's not the point uhm 
no you don't want the money 
you want to see it 
Yeah well yes 
I mean I think I think the most frustrating thing about television is uhm the amount of people that that uhm want to be involved 
there 's a lot of uhm script r script editors and producers who are frustrated creatively themselves 
and uhm 
Oh sure 
what you 've done 
We well not not that they want to screw up they want 
they want to contribute 
and so you 're you 're pulled in several different directions and and 
And again what happens then is that you sort of lose the skill you lose 
you forget the reason that you wanted to write whatever you were writing to begin with 
They the sort of relationship that we had both as friends and as writers because it 's just such a 
The B B C were like this third party that kind of came in 
the viewers wanted to see and uhm 
and so what whatever kind of things have been important to your to your script were were trivialised really in in order for them to get what they wanted to get 
have had that that experience with television 
Certainly with the the theatre that I 've written that 's been far more rewarding 
Yes yes 
Mmm 
Yes and you had some of those performances since 
What sort of plays do you write 
Mmm mmm 
Mmm mmm 
Uhm well I write uhm 
At the moment I 've got two commissions one which is this uh a commission to write a what will be I suppose a family show 
and 
and uhm 
sort of play that will be toured by a company called Monstrous Regiment 
Mmm 
What what area of entertainment are you in then 
music business 
uhm I do 
Oh right my husband 's in the music business 
So I understand 
What 's he do 
he 's a keyboard player and produces a bit on his own 
publishing deal with with uhm what 's his name W E A 
Warner Brothers 
Mmm 
Great 
Is he does he have a successful career 
I mean it 's 
you know it 's always difficult 
Is he exclusively W E A 
Well uh as a e e in the songwriting yes 
but he uhm he uhm 
Now he 's working with Virgin at the moment because he 's working on Sarah Jane Morris 's album 
but uhm 
He he works with with va various different record companies you know in production and session playing as a as a in in in in live gigs 
for a long time 
Who 
Sorry sorry I 
He was with Working Week for for quite a long time and and he doesn't he doesn't do a lot of live playing any more 
He tends to tends to work with 
Harry Beckett he plays with quite a lot 
and Coup D'Etat 
I don't know if you know the the jazz jazz scene much at all 
Right 
I 've heard of him I I I 
I have 
I 've heard of him 
Yes I mean he he 's done all right 
He 's arrived 
I didn't start producing plans until Thursday 
Last Thursday 
Uhm to a certain extent yes 
OK 
the best way to remember things is to write it down 
etc 
Mhm 
Who told you that 
Mhm 
and this wasn't a problem 
Maybe 
can still be improved even if it is fairly good 
Mhm 
in previous weeks 
use the resources available to me more effectively 
Mhm yeah 
So you now feel that you 're getting on top of the work 
Yes 
and uh you understand what 's going on 
And that 's in seminars and lectures 
We don't uh have seminars as such 
We have tutorials lectures and practicals 
Mhm 
I haven't been ab able 
throughout the day 
probably take some exercise 
And so uhm perhaps tomorrow 
Mmm 
It sounds that you 're wanting to take care of yourself physically as well 
But you worry about eating 
Is it 
Uhm I 'm not quite sure what you 're saying 
Or are you saying that you uhm lose your hunger as soon as you 've got food there and 
I take it you know what the what 's causing that 
Yes 
Is that a new experience for you 
Fairly new 
I see 
And you do your own cooking 
Yes 
Fairly 
forward to eating his own food 
I don't uhm 
Not fairly elaborate or anything 
Right 
It saves time 
Mhm 
It 's certainly convenient for cooking 
But uh if you had the choice would you prefer to have a meal which has been freshly prepared with uh fresh ingredients and so on 
It would be more expensive 
Yes 
I would consider trying that 
I understand that if you had the choice 
Yes 
I would 
you 'd find that more appetizing 
Right 
Uh I mean I just wanted to understand that 
D' you think that 's part of it 
or is there something more to it than that 
Yes 
I wouldn't say food was becoming boring 
Mhm 
I wouldn't say there was too much variety 
I think it 's an improvement from the past 
So d' you uh it sounds as if you feel there 's something more to it than just the quality of the food 
Yes 
The taste and nutritive value 
Fine 
very balanced diet 
But I think it could be more varied 
there have been a number of thefts of food from our communal refrigerators 
Yes 
Mhm 
Do you think it 's one of the other students 
in the same boat really 
Well when you 're saying thefts is it large quantities or just the occasional 
It 's just the occasional 
Tin or bottle of milk or something 
Mm 
D' you eat on your own 
Uhm more or less or less 
I do occasionally eat with other people 
Yes 
Well uh just to give me a picture of it I mean 
do you cook your meal 
and the other person cooks theirs 
and then you sort of bring it out to table and chat 
or do you ever share cooking 
No I don't ever share cooking no 
Yes 
They do 
not to a great extent 
I haven't given it much thought 
They are at the moment 
Yes 
Mm 
Or whether it may be little to do with the food 
more often than not it was my mother that cooked or sometimes my father 
I cooked for myself 
Up here it 's time thing 
What 
congenial 
More more than at Prankard Hall 
Mm 
To some extent 
Are your parents talkative 
They are 
Yes 
Or are you 
I can be when I 'm at home 
Yes 
When I 'm talking to them but not during usually during mealtimes 
Right 
and they are much less busy than during the day 
Is the mealtime the worst time of the day for you 
No 
I don't think there is a wo best or worst time 
They can vary 
during the day 
No 
I have one or two more 
Mhm 
I mean I I I don't mean anything necessarily profound uh 
but are there have you got to know more people 
and have you do you find it easier just to chat to people 
Yes 
Yes 
Definitely 
college 
Yes 
Yes 
Right 
You say that the uhm the timetabling 
It it it sounds to me as if you 're you 've taken some sort of control over that and that you you tried out timetable and you found it wasn't actually 
Well I have an academic timetable 
Yes 
Right 
Yeah 
But creating your own is a help 
I will modify it 
Yes 
Uhm 
producing an effective timetable 
Yes 
such as it is 
What 
Have you got an example of it that I can see 
Before our art guy improved it 
Uh yeah 
A number of members of staff have the same problem 
Yes 
It 's much more legible 
That 's actually all all it needs to be isn't it 
I mean the letter 's more distinct 
Yes 
but uhm I have to ha work at it 
Yes 
Is that written quickly 
It is fairly quickly 
Are you a are you generally a quick writer 
Yes 
When I 'm taking notes I have to be fairly quick 
Mhm 
And d' you use a biro 
Yes 
D' you find that easier 
Yes 
I think it is an option now 
How did you get to set about uh improving your writing 
which I thought were actually a bit rude 
Right 
What what did they say 
He actually wrote failed 
biology 
You should have been a medic 
you have the handwriting 
Right 
That is an insult isn't it 
A bit 
Yes 
That 's what he said 
Can you read your writing 
Yes 
Right 
Well occasionally I can't read the odd word 
Yes 
but uhm 
And ha has it been noted 
But the man who conducts the practicals 
Will it matter to you if he knows this is it 
It will 
I will ask him if he notices it if he doesn't mention it 
When you talk about sitting in on a course you 're actually not there as a participant 
I am there as a participant 
I was there in fact 
I went through it 
as a delegate 
So I was delegate 
Right 
So how come you 've been treated differently 
part of the course I suppose 
The idea was for me to see the material and say well yes 
I can do it 
or yes I like it 
whatever 
that 
uhm and that 's up to the individual how they use that 
Uhm they you know some of them bring bring a client in from the workplace and then have the counsellor sit in and coach them 
Some of them have some questionnaires 
They might do it you know however they 're going to use it 
uhm 
Mhm 
Mmm 
That 's right 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Yeah 
That 's right so 
So it 's 
yeah as I say there I think there are about twelve options that they had to do with this particular day 
It 's their day to use as they feel important for them 
Yeah 
Yes 
Yes 
you are sitting in on this course 
How sorry how do you mean 
But you 're not actually using the course as a delegate 
You tell me you 're not an experienced counsellor not to teach counselling 
But presumably you also do the course in order to acquire some counselling skills for practice 
Yes 
Yes 
Yes 
there 
Mm 
Theoretically yes 
Uhm 
Probably 
I mean I was I was pretty much advanced on the delegates 
Right 
Mm 
Right 
I mean one of the one of the the the girls actually said 
well she 's experienced and then she sort of said 
very experienced 
So I think it sort of came across 
yes I could have done it a lot better but but I certainly could do what they were doing 
I mean I was sort of going further than the stuff that they were they were doing 
uhm and I did did learn some oh bits on language 
uh a little bit on the on N L P 
uhm but I 'd read that and he didn't really use that 
the the content of what he did but it wasn't actually used on the course 
But uhm th you know a few 
uh I I 'm not an experienced counsellor that I could sit there and just counsel anybody through anything and so on 
I don't know what to do here 
You know so that 's what I 'm saying that I feel that I would need much more experience to be able to deliver the course and feel confident that I could demonstrate it or handle anything that came up anywhere 
you know to be able to do that 
But as I say I was further there than I 
OK uhm or where they 're going to be 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Yeah 
Mm 
Mm 
Are they the trainers 
No 
To where no not the trainers 
The trainers are much more experienced 
No 
The where the course is taking the people 
No 
the guy the the the lead guy there 's a clinical psychologist 
counsellor 
couple of the others 
but one of the other ones was this guy Charles Edward Clarke or whatever his name is 
And he was the head of B A C 
Yeah 
pretty experienced counsellors 
yes 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Yes 
Mm 
Mm 
Oh true true 
Now I 'm wondering 
Yeah 
said 
No 
so you didn't 
Yeah yeah 
gave an indication of what that should sound like 
And that was it 
Uhm and my feelings about that are 
So I mean it was a very brief intro that was left deliberately very loose so there was no sort of but 
Mm 
or 
Mhm 
Mhm 
Mm 
Mhm 
Mm 
Mhm 
Mm 
Right 
So you actually wanted people to know that you weren't just there as a delegate 
and that your role was different to theirs 
Yes 
Mm 
Mm 
What the need was to separate yourself from the group 
That was my first 
exercise 
that 
and I wanted to 
Mhm 
Mm 
So you said it out loud 
thing that was happening 
otherwise I wouldn't be anybody if you see what I mean 
Because I didn't have a job 
I couldn't say well 
I 'm personnel manager here 
to to say that 
Mhm 
Mhm 
Mm 
Mm 
Which is what in fact 
The course 
OK 
That I 'm on the course 
So that I 'm studying 
Mm 
It didn't matter what it was 
Yeah 
I 'm doing something 
know more on that subject than other people 
justify my existence in terms of 
So I needed to put a tag on me 
Mm 
Mm 
Yes 
Mm 
Well me 
Mhm 
to justify your existence 
cos it it cert I don't think it 's really coming from them 
sort of thing 
well yeah I guess I need to be doing something to please him 
So you know just uhm that it would be healthier for me to be doing something 
Do you do you think it 's them 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Yeah 
Rather than sat around not doing anything 
Yeah 
May be that 
I do I don't know 
I don't I don't really know 
uh 
I 'm going to try and have Wednesday off 
This week 
uhm 
Uhm 
You 're back this week aren't you 
Yes but I 'm off Thursday and Friday 
Oh right 
I 'm probably off Friday again 
I 'm meeting up with a friend 
Mhm 
I 've been let down once before but there you go 
uhm 
Yes you know her 
The one that phoned up yesterday 
Do I 
Oh her 
Her 
Yes 
that should be eventful 
Yes 
Make sure you 've got your flak jacket with you 
They don't seem to materialise though do they 
So we shall see 
I 've got to work this out 
Try not to oh I know what I haven't done 
I haven't uh plugged that in 
Yeah 
Uhm 
Nice bread 
I like it 
Yeah I know 
It 's I think that 's the best 
I mean 
He has French French everything almost 
French everything 
Oh 
So he had a stroke 
Yes 
apparently 
He 's forty odd I would have thought 
OK 
So you 're an old man 
I think we all know that 
Thank you 
Uhm no he 's uhm but you see people have strokes not necessarily when they 're old 
Strokes are quite often uhm the fate of k youngish people uhm 
Uhm my father had a stroke 
He had a stroke when he was thirty-three 
oh well forty something anyway 
Mhm 
Uhm 
uhm 
delibitating 
Uhm I I 'd spell it a different way if I were you 
But I know exactly what you mean 
Yeah 
It was 
Delibitating 
Whoops 
Debilitating 
Try that one 
It did a lot of damage certainly 
Yeah uhm 
Left him in a bit of a state 
Debilitating right 
Yes 
uhm 
Uhm 
still seems to be able to uh work the ovens anyway 
now enables people to cope 
Yes 
jumper 
It 'll improve the flavour 
Uhm it enables people to come through 
Uhm 
Yah 
Mhm 
appearance more 
Uhm 
Now then 
Uhm 
to do that as she hadn't been there for a while yeah 
Oh good 
Uhm 
Oh good good 
Best start s best start saving 
Yes 
Did she look at the other operas 
and uh sort of uh say that she 'd 
uh no 
I 'll tell you now 
No 
She didn't 
was she not allowed to or 
She didn't 
No no 
Cos you only asked me to look at that specific one 
so I did 
if she wanted to 
No 
No 
Sh sh she well not Well 
no no she isn't into a lot of opera 
and if you start giving her a series of events to go to it 'll make her shy away 
I see 
she 'd quite like to go because she hasn't seen it his his new conservatory has she 
No 
Don't know 
I mean it do doesn't have to be uhm Le Manoir 
I don't think so 
Burton-Race 
Well if he 's handy and his delightful wife 
Yes 
uh which is on on the way almost 
the atmosphere at Le Manoir 
Christine 
uhm 
so why not do it 
has a sense of proportion 
Hold on 
Here 's a napkin 
By the way did I mention my dustbin 's been blown over in my back garden again 
I 've given up now 
uhm 
All right 
uhm 
Yes you did 
You did yes 
I 've put newspapers in and I don't know 
Uhm 
Well mine 's been prised open by that large ginger cat 
Can't get mine off 
vacuum-formed plastic 
it it actually sort of 
more or less uhm where yours just drops on it you have to push it on 
lip and in fact it 's not easy to get it off 
It must be a highly ingenious cat uhm 
shed 
Yes 
It It eats the contents of my dustbin and then deposited it in your garden 
Oh yeah 
Very funny 
uhm 
Hah 
So when was the sell-by date of this soup 
I wouldn't dare look 
I mean some time last year wasn't it 
Some time last year 
uhm 
Fish soup 
Some time last year 
My God 
My mother would be horrified if she knew this 
Cor 
It tastes good 
So 's this 
Uhm 
uhm 
Have to rely upon you for that because the cold effect is still annoying my taste 
Uhm 
Oh I know 
Oh yes 
Oh God yeah 
Surprised he 's a solicitor 
uh 
Why do you say that 
He does appear to be uhm 
Well I don't know about diffident 
I think servile would be a desc m more accurate description 
Servile and and and spotty with it 
What type of practice does he work at 
He 's very ha Well he 's got skin problems 
Yeah 
But he can't help that 
uhm 
No 
But it goes with the general presentation 
Does it 
Well I think so 
Yes 
His servility and the s spots go well together 
Uhm God 
You 're a hard person 
Yeah 
Well what I 've I I find uh irritating about him is that it 's virtually impossible to get rid of him without telling him to go as you as as you probably noticed 
As I no noticed 
Yeah 
I was wondering when you were going to do that 
I could see you were wondering when I was going to do it 
Moment 
Is he uh Is he single 
I don't know 
he had a girlfriend staying 
Uhm but the the lodger last time I visited was uh of a different kind and 
Mhm 
Oh I see 
So I don't know what he 's up to 
Uhm 
No longer female 
Oh dear 
it wasn't what I was thinking 
He he d he 
Oh but what type of property has he got 
It 's a flat isn't it 
No 
Three bedroomed house 
Oh 
Here 
Uhm well not exactly no 
as part of the house 
It 's part of the back wall 
What do you mean by three bedroomed 
Oh you 're right 
In other words it 's a bit like the back back wall 's been taken away 
Where you normally have a back wall you 've got the conservatory downstairs and it 's all glass doors 
Yes uhm 
Yes 
via sliding doors 
Mhm 
uhm 
Uhm 
It 's actually quite attractive 
I understand with matrimonial cases 
I suppose so 
Uhm 
divorce in his earlier days 
Did he 
uhm 
uhm 
Found it quite depressing 
I imagine it probably is uhm 
All the toing and froing and 
Uhm 
This cr&egrave;me fra&icircumflex;che fraÓche certainly adds to the soup doesn't it 
uhm 
uhm 
Nice soup 
I like the bread 
Uhm 
Nice and seedy 
Uhm 
It 's it It 's not the three seeded one 
Yeah that 's right 
Yeah 
Their seed seeded batch loaf 
Yeah 
Batch loaf 
No 
Really 
Ah seeded batch loaf 
uhm 
Uhm 
And saut&eacute;ed in good quality virgin oil and then rubbed with garlic 
adds another dimension to the soup 
uhm 
Italian 
Italian 
No 
Bottled in Provence 
Well it could be Italian but it s it says bottled in Provence on the label which means nothing at all 
Uhm 
There 's an enormous racket going on with Edam cheese 
Have you heard about that 
No 
What 's that 
Edam cheese has been exported 
What 're all those 
Pardon 
All those things sticking up over there 
What things sticking up 
All those shoots sticking up 
See on the 
Haemocaelis 
Yeah 
Uh uh a whole load of them between the crab apple and the 
Yes 
Yes 
Haemocaelis 
Oh right 
uhm 
Ah yes they ten uh tend to be 
but via such exotic routes as Andorra in the Pyrenees and Tanzania in whichever country that lies 
Tanzania 
Mhm 
Which coun what 
But Tanzania 's a country 
I know 
Yes 
I was being sarcastic 
Oh right 
OK good 
does not attract any subsidy 
a subsidy 's paid for exports sent to countries outside the bloc 
And you then send it to Germany 
which wouldn't actually be accounted for by normal sort of preferences 
Mhm 
Thank you 
Oh right 
Probably don't eat 
uhm 
Uhm 
Well it 's a matter of taste isn't it 
in the case of Edam 
In the case of Edam 
Yes 
You obviously don't think much of Edam 
Well it 's a very boring sort of cheese isn't it 
I mean it 's all right thinly sliced with a with an apple I suppose 
uhm 
Like Gruy&egrave;re 
Well that 's entirely a different thing 
And so you 're a bit disappointed 
And then then then the dilemma was whether you carry on as if he could take over or you 'd have to start all over again 
Yes I was 
Oh no 
Yes 
I think so 
Well yes 
I think I 've got to 
appointments 
Yes 
I mean it 's just been crazy really 
Mm 
uh but 
But in fact you almost do 
Well last time you you so nearly said 
the tablets that this is kind of dunno don't know whether to laugh or cry 
Well I think that in some ways I am saying things are all right 
But I know that they are not all right 
got to act 
really 
oh for I don't know for whatever reasons 
I I don't know 
What more 
Oh I could be able to just chuck it all away 
What is the difference for you between experiencing it and feeling that you 've made it up 
then I should be able to stop it 
And will keep you in control 
Mm 
Everything 's all right really 
just imagination 
like on on one hand she is quite sympathetic you know 
uh uh then the other side she she obviously hasn't realised that I 'm not going to pass the year 
Is that true 
that I am or I 'm not 
What 
then yes I could I can because 
You mean it 's theoretically possible 
Yes 
invoking 
By their standards 
Not 
I think that passing or failing the year is 
I mean it 's obviously important 
Well she said it 's your decision you you know 
We said we 've given you some money if you want to pay for an extra year 
Well it would be really difficult too 
I mean they 've done it and there 's ways round it 
I could go external or I could get a job 
And you know it 's like coming to see you 
You see your tutor once every two or three weeks 
I mean you just go to see them 
Well no 
It 's not that it 's useless 
it 's just difficult because you 're out 
It it demands much more of you because you are out of the normal 
Y You have even less contact 
Just as useless 
That 's only part of the problem 
uhm and that is and and and the struggle is that on the one hand you do want to be taken seriously and you get uh you feel mortified that it 's not taken seriously enough and on the other hand you get very worried if it 's taken seriously I don't uh uh uh th the you know because you then you feel all the worries that anybody does sometimes 
But it does 
you know uh 
that you 're the one who needs to accept that there 's sufficient for you to be worried about to want to take it seriously 
Yes 
Yes 
I know I 'm I think if I could I know I sort of started out saying 
I don't want to talk to anyone 
I just want it to happen at its normal rate 
I I just feel that I 'm I 'm not engaging with people at all 
well I can have conversations but I feel completely disengaged 
Mm 
I don't think I 'd shout at the moment 
Well you might or you might not 
But I But I think if you felt you wanted to 
It sounds as if you felt you might have wanted to to me 
the the issue then is how you set about doing that 
to begin with 
And what difference does it make 
Well N H S is free 
Apart from that 
is uh 
individual areas 
I can't afford to pay for private 
Has your father got private insurance 
No 
He 's not even working now 
Right 
OK 
Oh you mean like a medical policy 
Mm 
lost it 
her whole family 
Uh but she said because they were saying John 
that was the one who said she 'd had something similar to say 
Oh well you have to allow yourself to be depressed 
and you can learn from depression 
and you should go swimming when you feel depressed or do something 
and don't worry about working 
And she walked in and said 
you know 
I told her that I 'd had to take these tablets and that 's why I felt like I wasn't thinking properly 
Then she said oh you must stop doing that 
normal 
And then Meryl came in 
and she said you know 
if you want some help my whole family have come from this 
Yes 
Mhm 
U C H 
I 've a contact 
uhm 
How long wait 
Well that I couldn't say 
I I really couldn't answer that 
start to do something like that 
You start a placement 
Or I or you they have ones which are means related 
but you 'd have to commit yourself to at least three times a week and you 'd have to commit yourself to two years 
With the students you mean 
Mm 
Uh my friend Caroline she goes once a week 
and I think she pays five pounds each time she goes 
That 's very reasonable well yes 
Where is that at 
I don't know 
I can ask her 
I dou doubt she 'd want me to go to the same place as her though because she is a bit possessive about things 
I mean I could go once a week possibly twice a week 
but three times a week is just too much 
Well I think you know that they interview trainees 
That That 's what they do 
you see a student 
You might say that 
but I had to meet this girl who I haven't seen for ten years from my school 
And she was awful when I knew her at school 
And when I asked her what she 's taking she said uh she was becoming a psychiatrist 
Yes I can I yes I know 
I mean what people are like isn't necessarily related to whether they 're good at their job to be quite honest uhm 
And I then I said there 's less pus involved 
Yes 
I suppose 
and it 's all wasted on me totally wasted 
Mm 
Mmm 
Mmm 
Yes 
really loved it 
Yes 
Yes 
Yes 
Greek yoghurt is fantastic 
Yes it 's the same isn't it 
You know yoghurt I 'm sorry 
Yes Greek 
I was thinking of Turkish yoghurt 
fried aubergines and yoghurt I think 
Oh lovely 
and and cream 
Absolutely delicious 
Mm 
I mean it 's virtually the same I suppose 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
You didn't come to Turkey with us did you 
What no 
You went to Greece though didn't you 
Yes 
Uh we went we went to uh Hagios Lindos 
Lindos 
Yes 
Villa Rainbird 
That 's right 
Yes 
Very good that I 'm sure 
It was great 
It was good actually 
It was a fantastic villa 
are you going back there 
Uh no 
Are you going back are you 
Never return they say 
ever been there 
No 
we went to Lindos originally 
Did you come with me 
Yeah 
No 
Right 
Yeah 
Right 
It was a similar sort of thing 
Well two two of them 
Oh that 's right 
we went and slept on the beach or something 
Uhm 
Anyway the beach turned into a hotel when we were there 
Yeah 
That 's right 
Yeah 
I mean it 's awful 
Well we had 
When did we go back 
Trish and I went back with the kids 
Really 
Yeah 
You didn't tell us about it 
Yes we did actually 
Yes 
They ha 
something was mentioned 
Mhm 
and I can't remember what 
We couldn't afford it any more 
It was quite an expensive holiday 
Because then you 'll be going out for a meal and that 
the weekend 
You know 
Uhm I mean mean I obviously couldn't 
It was difficult 
That was all 
I mean the lovely beds and lovely uh terrace overlooking the harbour 
and we can see Spiros 
Yeah 
Mm 
You could see the gutters 
Jill was there taking her temperature 
That 's right 
And Alastair wasn't very old 
How old Alastair how old was he 
two or something 
Two and a half uhm 
Two 
Yes 
Two 
because I may have told you 
then telling us his children are supposed to be continent at one 
That 's a conditioned reflex isn't it 
You sit them on a cold lavatory and they evacuate their bowels 
Well wouldn't you under those circumstances 
I mean everybody knows about these stories don't you 
bare bottom the lot you know 
Mm 
Mm 
If you know what I mean 
Vanishing hitchhiker 
Yes 
There 's been a book several books published on the concept 
which we all know about and which I 've read lots of times in newspapers 
I mean the classical one 's the person who microwaves their poodle to dry it 
Urban myths 
Mm 
Mm 
Yes 
Yes that 's right 
That 's right 
The person who has bees in their hair uh what 
When we had bouffant hairstyles 
Oh yes 
That 's right 
There are cockroaches crawling around inside even if you have grates 
Uhm 
People who are particularly lonely 
Uhm 
And it they nearly always 
Very close relative 
Yes yes yes 
Friend of a friend 
Yes 
Oh I know who it was exactly 
And of course none of them really exist at all 
Mm 
So who invents them 
quickly become stories which become part of the folklore I mean I I guess that 's never happened 
Someone said wouldn't it be funny if someone squatted down on the ski slope in bare skin 
becomes part of a of a series of jokes or raconteurs ' tales you know 
and then it becomes part 
and you say 
oh I know someone who said that 
and then it becomes real 
I can't think of one at the moment 
Oh yes there 's the famous one I read in there were two famous ones which I read in the newspapers 
He 's stand He comes back home 
and the light on in the bedroom and these two people going hammer and tongs 
And he thinks right I 'll get the bastard 
hello I 'm home you know 
Mm mm mm 
Yes 
Right 
Yes 
Yes 
Right 
Yes 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Cement 
There 's the vicar under the car 
The vicar 
Oh oh the vicar one 
There 's the vicar one 
Again a marvellous story 
So so she thinks I 'll give him a surprise 
So she uh undoes his fly buttons grabs hold of his penis you see 
hits sits sits up hits his head underneath the car knocks himself unconscious 
She goes rushing into the house to call an ambulance 
Who was that under the car 
Really it 's got a sort of music hall ring about it in fact 
Yes 
Yes 
Definitely 
People seem to come out with those stories 
I heard of someone who was repairing a car and he 
Yes 
Yes 
That 's right 
Yes 
Yes 
Mm 
And in fact I 've got this book 
I think it 's called The Vanishing Hitchhiker because it 's about uh uh 
It 's probably written in America originally because uh we don't come across this myth in this country about this hitchhiker chap this cold winter day 
and he takes some hitchhiker who either disappears during the journey at a point where someone was killed 
or there 's the hook isn't it where there 's some hook involved where a person 's been hung up by the hook or something really weird 
And anyway this book is called The Vanishing Hitchhiker 
and he 's analysing this because he thinks this is a new form of folklore 
and where did the folklore st where do stories come from originally 
Uhm is there a grain of ss truth in some of the stories 
You know Hansel and Gretel 
the Opies where they look at the uh realities behind some of this sort of myth 
these nursery rhymes if you looked at its causes sample-wise 
Yes 
Yes yes 
Yes 
Mm 
Mm 
Opay 
Opie 
Mm mm mm 
Mm mm 
Yes 
I know if something happens to my father he does recount it once and if you 're there you know about it and that sounds great 
Then the next week you 're still there but you you you hear him say it again and it 's totally different 
It 's grown into a nice big story 
Oh absolutely 
And the viewpoint 's changed 
and all sorts of things 
The viewpoint 
Well well I tend to repeat almost exactly the same stories to my friends 
try it out more or less in the same way on everybody else 
Yes yes 
I mean there there are really good storytellers 
And I mean I I I 'm not 
But I mean not only can they put accents and change positions which is always very interesting 
but they the actual stories sound terribly simple 
and they embellish them in such a way that they become incredibly funny 
You know one thing follows on to another 
I can never remember jokes easily 
I mean we have friends who come and they 're always cracking jokes one after another 
Mm mm 
Mm mm 
Mm mm 
I know 
Ah it 's marvellous 
Yeah 
Timing is so difficult though 
Yes 
my children were small and they went to school and they learnt this thing about eeny meeny miney mo 
Uh I used to say 
get a tiger off your toe 
Oh yes that 's right 
I just sort of looked at various conversations 
And in fact then when I started I decided which conversation I was going to analyse or try to analyse because I thought that was what I was supposed to be doing 
And then I wasn't quite sure of how to analyse it when it came down to it 
So it starts off and I I wrote it all down 
tell you what I thought about 
Mm 
Mm 
you what in fact you 've done 
the work I 've done all those years must be looked at as a sector of your life 
and then 
Yes 
Yes 
I did too 
I chose more an episode than a language 
conversation 
Do you want coffee 
Yes 
explained to him 
Yeah 
Yes 
Yeah 
in in mind of what you said 
this conversation needs 
or quite what we were you know trying to get out of this conversation 
So sort of halfway through I suppose I I started to think 
well am I supposed to be looking at what I want to get out of the conversation or what the other person wants to get out of this conversation because this could be totally different actually 
communication is 
understanding of what you 're aiming to get out of this situation 
and where the other persons are 
That 's why I felt that I was a character 
Yeah 
It is 
It is 
That that was quite new 
Yeah 
some sort of a model 
Yeah 
Some sort of model 
That was that was pretty good actually 
base it on 
What did you do 
I pondered on it quite a lot and found it you know realised that I didn't really understand what I was supposed to be doing 
Exactly 
Just as you said 
Yeah 
And then I thought well I can take an everyday incident or conversation and analyse that 
then getting into the dialogue and forgetting completely that that 's what I was supposed to be doing and then on the other side of it not remembering what I 'd said in order to be able to analyse it 
So in the end I just thought this is ridiculous this is only the starting-point and if I 'm going to make such a meal out of every exercise I 'll never complete the course 
and that 's it 
I mean I haven't written it down or anything 
That 's right 
I can recall it a little bit 
Yeah 
Yes 
When you get into every detail 
And then I thought 
well I 've only to get one one small conversation 
and I thought 
and uhm 
and also there 's the dressing 
you know you can put much more detail into them 
And I thought oh well maybe not 
because it it has that impact on you and you 're the author of it so you 're allowed to be you 're allowed to be unscientific and a bit broad with it 
To record it 
Yeah 
And in the end you you are going to be describing it to us 
You 're the only person who was there 
you and yeah 
Yes 
There are occasions where 
Yes 
So you could actually say 
and then I saw the look in his eyes when I said that which is part of the communication which you don't actually write it down 
It 's an odd thing uhm 
There 's there 's an odd thing that I don't know what it 's 
So you get one one authorial voice you see that might be this 
There 's three basic kinds 
There 's one that says you know it 's the author 
Dickens usually does that 
You usually know it 's Dickens writing Dickens 
it 's almost as if they 're pretending they 've put 2-or-3-words there and objective 
Jane Eyre 
Yeah 
Jane Eyre 
So so they 're pretending they 're the character or 
who then 
uhm Victor Frankenstein and then Victor Frankenstein then says and then the monster said to me 
distorting them as they say the story 
First 
You know I 've never read Frankenstein 
Terrible isn't it 
It 's all I 've seen the film and everything else 
Then that 's the problem you may have come across 
Haven't you 
Yeah 
So do do we decide here for the purpose of this exercise that it 's our eyes 
Uhm we haven't got much of a choice 
Well I don't think that we have actually 
uh we 'd all made our separate decisions hadn't we and obviously had similar problems in deciding how we were going to go about this 
Oh well I think in understanding it to start with that was the main problem 
Yeah 
Mhm 
come to the conclusion as to what we 've done 
Like what 's your conversation like 
Yes 
Uh my conversation was going in on Saturday morning into a shop where I was picking up some things that were due to be framed 
And I went in 
And I had a very very busy Saturday 
This of course is an important bit of of background information 
a whole lot of things 
and went in to the people that I I knew and I 've have been using for some years and said 
And he said well well can you come back in half an hour 
And I said no I can't 
And I 'd also taken back something that I 'd collected the previous Saturday with the hope of it being done correctly 
So I went in with a bone of of complaint if you like 
Bone of contention 
And then he came out and said it wasn't ready 
a lot of anxiety and crossness and feeling let down was coming out 
I said oh no 
That 's that 's so annoying 
And so he then said well it will only be fifteen or twenty minutes if you 'd like to come back 
And then I showed him what was wrong with the other one 
And it was very strange because my reaction to that was oh no 
No 
That 's all right 
I 'll come back next Saturday cos I felt I was putting out him out 
And I I said no 
It 's all right 
It 's not urgent 
It doesn't really matter 
It 's just annoying for me 
He said well no we don't want you to have to come back twice 
We don't like customers to feel let down 
I 'll come and and deliver it to you 
And then another uh sort of block to that came from me 
In fact I 'm going to be out all day 
I 'm not going to be back until six 
And so he then said but I don't finish here until six anyway 
And I then said and I have to go out at seven 
So it would have to be between six and seven 
He said that 's all right 
I 'll I 'll come between six and seven 
So I said well that 's awfully nice 
And I I thought I don't know really how to analyse that other than the fact that uhm it was very good customer relations 
Yeah 
Say who you are 
Not who your ages or your 
going to be rather ashamed about this 
Ha ha ha ha 
Sorry 
Really 
That seriously is the only one in fact 
Not with his private secretary 
No no no no 
No 
You shouldn't say things like that 
No 
three-or-four-words 
I i it is 
it i 
I I I 've heard that I I I I he I heard that story as well 
Oh I 
And it 's amazing that there are not more people saying it 
What 
Sounds like quite a high yeah last week 
It is a story it is a story that goes round but it hasn't actually been published 
Oh excellent 
We 've started 
Come on Alec 
It isn't in Private Eye 
I 'm sure I read it in the paper 
Well it 's a 
Yes 
He 's having it off doubtless 
Oh all right 
Oh no I 'm so confused now 
Oh I do 
it is now 
Do you 
Brenda Sch is it Brend is it Brenda Schwarzkopf 
And you liked her too Bert 
Or have I got the right one 
Who are we on about Sarah 
John Major 's having an affair with Brenda Schwarzkopf 
We 've got there now 
What 's that 
Well 
We 've got there now 
Do you fancy him three-or-four-words 
So if someone comes up and says 
John Major 
No Norman 
Oh Norman 
Yes he is 
Is he is he your ideal man 
He 's well funnily enough he 's quite cosy 
I can see that 
Oh 
What is what is that man called 
Ben Jonson 
I think basically people like Wells well played fellows 
Yes 
Oh 
Oh Magic Johnson 
Magic Johnson 
Well built players 
Oh definitely 
Or more stamina than me 
I don't like bony things 
That 's right 
Yeah 
Thank you 
at the same time he can catch 
Is that 
Well I 'm not 
That 's the whole point 
I 've been running all through the day 
I think it 's one way of one way of keeping you fit actually 
Ten thousand plus women 
That 's right 
What 's wrong with Tommy though 
He 's got one one for every day of the year 
Let 's eat this smoked salmon 
on a plate 
Mm 
It 's gone 
That 's much better 
Cos he wouldn't dare take it from you 
That 's so no that 's really unkind 
Sorry 
But she had to go to the loo 
Didn't didn't 
That 's horrible 
to supper and I I expect my my mummy and daddy to be exceptional which they never are 
I shall never come home again 
tell her the sort of things that 
No 
Never 
No 
I never go home anyway so 
What 
What what d' you say 
That is on the practical joke front 
Is that OK 
At least it 's not a 
Sorry 
Hasn't changed much 
No 
I 'm walking into the dining room so I can sit down 
Yes 
You need brushing up 
Yeah 
Are you being recorded 
Mm 
I know 
There 's a nice bit of conversation 
Yeah 
You would do 
Yeah 
Terry well you 've missed out on all the juicy bits 
No 
Mostly 
We touched on your love life 
business 
But that didn't last very long between me and you 
It 's going to be it 's going to be a sort of 
Sorry 
I hope he didn't 
Mm 
I think he sounds extremely nice 
Mm 
Do you like him 
No 
Somehow he looks nice 
No 
Mm 
He 's got that lip 
He just grins 
He happens to shave three times a day 
No 
than most 
Did you hear that 
No 
But it 's funny 
Chatting her up 
But what you mean is 
No 
It 's a problem 
you get blue bearded there 
Mm 
You y you en you encourage it no end 
Yep 
I never had to do that 
How far up do you go 
It 's just a matter of three-or-four-words 
Oh Robert 
No 
I think Robert 's just too lazy 
He 's going to have to be 
When you when when Robert goes into d goes to Disneyworld one of the things there 's two things 
What 's he going to do in Disneyworld 
He 's going to be Mickey Mouse 
He 's going to be Mickey Mouse 
Uhm but w one of the 
Apparently there 's an article in the last one of the magazines and it said that the one thing that was absolutely anathema was hair anywhere on the face 
Mm 
The gnomes 
Mm 
I 'd never get a job 
And does Robert know about this three-or-four-words 
Terrible disappointment 
I don't know 
I actually kept it 
Oh 
Yeah 
I kept it in case he wanted to see it 
But how did it happened 
He got a job 
But what made him want to go to Disneyworld for the job 
And I said 
who with 
And he said Eurodisney 
And and actually they offered him a job 
This is at Eurodisney 
Oh Eurodisney 
Oh that 's wonderful 
Paris it is isn't it 
Yeah 
Yes 
It is 
Yes 
It 's very exciting 
How lovely 
Very 
Mm 
I understand Suffolk 
No 
They do have they do do some funny things 
I understand Suffolk whereas she doesn't understand br broader border Scots 
Border Scots is quite seriously difficult 
Scots 
Yes 
Well I know it 's got traces of other languages 
Well it 's got different words 
Yes 
Sort of it 's sort of Geordie as well as Scottish 
But it 's much more much more Norse 
There 's lots of different words 
Yeah 
Norse 
Yes 
I think I think that 's probably probably correct 
with hyacinths 
pre-dated house 
Do you want to sit down 
Really 
Yes 
I 've never been round Berwick 
It sound uh it looks rather 
Sorry can I interrupt you 
Uhm some white wine for Mrs Beak Beak 
Mm 
There 's a bottle of Bordeaux open and sitting on a shelf 
Open the wine 
The box 
So B Berwick 
I mean it 's 
You should go there 
No 
Carry on 
We could do that 
walls 
the Scots 
That 's right 
I can't remember when it became English took over 
Fifteen thirty-five or something 
Thirteen thirty-three 
You can talk about after the battle of Harraden Hill 
Is this Berwick 
I think uh uh Berwick and Edward whoever it was at the time came out to relieve it 
in in a star-shaped formation 
in into the s s star 
And it was su supposed to be the first u recorded use of controlled firepower if you 're a mil military man 
Oh and they they blew a trumpet and in order to fire the arrows see 
Yes 
Yes 
Mm 
Into the star 
At one time 
Yes 
and then they fired 
Emma Smith 
Yes thanks 
Yes 
Mike Millican 
OK thank you 
uh form here 
You 've completed the P H D 
is that right 
Are you actually working now 
Yes 
no I 'm just doing little odd jobs here and there 
eh 
And I I finished in December so I 've been 
Right 
you spent two years in India 
Nearly two years yes 
How can I help you 
and uh it 's not a particularly easy time for finding jobs I think people are just not interested full stop 
niche for myself in terms of 
looking for jobs and making this uh 
the Guardian I suppose is the main place 
most of the adverts there will be for people with experience because that 's where you advertise for people with experience 
they 'll be looking for people with experience 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Mm mmm 
Yes 
Mm mmm 
yeah 
I mean if it 's the big companies you 're looking for then they will be on the milk round 
They 'll be the people who recruit one-or-two-words-obscured-by-noise 
So the thing really is to identify I think the areas of interest for you and then to approach them in a different way than waiting for an ad in the Guardian 
Mm mmm 
No 
Mmm 
I mean 
Right 
and so on 
Do you have the background information on all or any of these 
museums I have uh some kind of background in just because the work that I was doing was quite closely affiliated with museums and stuff 
I mean I 'm applying this week for a job at the V and A 
in the India department 
and that I was told by the head of the department 
so 
right 
But it it 's specific bit like India Department that you feel 
Well yes I mean the idea is I 'm not interested really in uh museums more generally 
I mean I wouldn't be interested in a more sort of 
OK so it 's a limited number of museums 
Very limited 
I mean actually ethnographic museum work is very limited 
OK uhm so it 's places like the V and A 
Are there are there other places 
Well there 's the Museum of Mankind but I don't think anyone 's about to leave there 
Do they know of your interest 
because although it 's a very restricted area there 's probably also a very restricted number of candidates 
Mmm 
Mmm 
Mmm 
Yeah 
Yes yeah 
not that restricted 
Aha 
OK 
places like that 
Museum of Mankind 
I don't know where that is 
Where is that 
colonial history the kind of museum that would be quite interesting 
but that 
you know that 's a sort of plan for the future 
That 's a project 
Yeah it 's a project 
Whose project is it 
I 'm not sure 
I mean I think there 's two people involved in it 
I can find that out 
you know I think they are certainly not employing people yet you know but 
Mmm 
it it 's worth letting them know 
Mmm 
Mmm 
Getting in touch with them first yeah 
Mmm 
I mean otherwise in a way I mean I 'm more interested in writing in a way than I am in museums 
Right 
OK well that 's covered touched on museums 
and published quite a lot which I haven't although my thesis is 
I mean Thames and Hudson have expressed an interest and it 's possible I would be able to publish something out of that but you know all that takes a very long time 
Yeah 
not going to be enormously commercial 
considerably more accessible than most people 's 
amusing and it 's got a lot of visual material in it and stuff like that 
I mean not the sort of C U P O U P kind of thing 
It 'd be great 
They do actually sell books 
Mm mmm 
mm mmm 
OK 
But other writing 
I mean I 'm interested in all sorts of writing 
I 'm interested in eventually trying to write a novel which I I have the material for 
You 've got the time but not the money maybe 
But my problem is that all my qualifications point me straight in the academic line 
Uh that 's right 
Right 
yes 
Well yes yes 
you know of the things I 'm applying for 
Well qualifications 
uh obviously they do because you 've taken a P H D and and that that does point you towards academia 
disciplines after a P H D tend to move out and start completely different sorts of careers 
yeah 
Mmm 
you know the book 's there and 
I mean can you can you generate articles 
Mmm 
Yeah I mean I 'm interested in 
I think feature articles and I 've done 
Uhm and I could probably do that here 
Right 
Right 
and and you can be a freelance raffer wri freelance writer you know 
Yes that 's a point 
editorial journalism for uh magazines you know 
I mean I 
that that sort of job you know it 's the kind of with girlie women 's magazines sort of aged thirteen up put your lipstick on sort of thing 
am not interested 
Absolutely 
Sham 
Uhm uhm I mean a lot of the magazines are like that 
The the two that I looked into were 
one was like that 
how to do your knitting pattern 
you know about dress and perfume and stuff like that 
but in fact they are nothing 
you know they are not really 
yeah there would be l 
but there are very wide ranges of magazines produced 
in in this country or or or wherever 
background human interest and things like that 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm mmm 
Mm 
Mm 
Yes 
Mm 
Mm mmm 
But how does one I mean how does one start something like that 
I mean most of the writing done for magazines is uh freelance work 
They 're not done by staff writers 
Mmm 
Mm 
Yes 
Sunday paper magazine but I find I don't know what you think of it 
I mean because they always want proof of one 's work 
and uh 
Yeah 
Absolutely 
proof that you have written that you can write and so on 
Yeah 
Do you want to have a go at this 
Yes please 
I do 
Put them in the middle 
And we 've got to shuffle these three times 
Do you mean you 
No 
Each of us has got to do it three times 
Oh each 
Oh Christ 
Me you me you me you 
So I won't go on too long 
Here we are 
Right OK 
One 
Mm 
are they in uh did you check whether there are any inverted cards or is that just too late 
It doesn't matter 
I usually ignore them if they 're inverted so 
Oh do you 
Yes 
Oh well 
To you 
But I but I 
I think your book on the medicine cards does that very well 
I mean when the cards are inverted they still get a positive message out of the cards 
That 's very good 
Yes 
Yes yes 
Like wh yes what you can do is put three in a chain 
Yes 
basically less nervous 
Yes 
I remember when the very first medicine card I I chose was the ant 
and I was incredibly disappointed at that 
and I 
and I I le I haven't killed an ant since 
So it was rather wonderful 
I spent hours in the kitchen kind of scooping them onto card and shoving them out the windows rather than killing them 
Yes 
Yes 
Yes 
I get rather squeamish about it 
I brought a wasp up from Speldhurst with me 
far from home 
And it was on the window and I thought pe perhaps I ought to kill it because somebody 'll get stung and then I thought no why shouldn't it have at least a chance even if it does sting everybody 
So I I just left it 
You 'd think in a previous state I probably would have just squashed it 
Yes 
That 's my second turn isn't it 
Yes 
Right 
So this is the last time then 
Yes 
Yes yes yes 
Right 
That 's it 
Right 
Uhm 
I 've had two bananas 
Is that all right 
Yes 
Right 
from there and you cover your card 
that 's what covers you 
I 'm a total pig 
Love them 
What is it 
Two of sticks 
Two of 
Yah 
Two of wands 
Hmm 
Hmm 
But it 's called sticks in mahjong 
Uh bamboo sticks that 's what they uhm 
Sticks 
Oh really 
Oh yes 
What the four different corners of the uhm sort of board or the wall that you see 
Uhm 
No 
They have a suite yes 
And one of the they have uhm Chinese characters 
circles and bamboo sticks are the three hands as it were like 
Ah there are three of them 
Yes 
Yes 
Does that convey anything to you 
He 's got a globe in his hand 
He looks fairly contemplative in a way 
He sort of 
Mm 
One hand is one wand is up and one wand looks planted 
And he 's up on a parapet looking out 
Yes you see 
contemplating the world at the moment in a way 
out 
Yes 
I wonder why he 's holding a globe 
It says here it looks like the sadness of Alexander amidst the grandeur of the world 's wealth 
Yes 
Mmm 
Ah well 
Yes 
He does look sort of s well contemplative 
I said didn't I 
not sad 
but 
Mm 
Well that seems fair enough 
Right the next card is what crosses you 
This is a to see what crosses you 
Mm yes 
That 's 
down 
Yes 
The one underneath that one 
Mm 
Ah 
All you see is visions 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
And now you 're in a contemplative state 
Yes 
It looks as though she 's verging on the dreamy 
Yes 
Do you think that applies to you at the moment 
Well it does in a way cos I am changing thinking about change a lot and having done this massage course which I 've got my uh assessment on Sunday 
Uhm and I am doing a year at the year psychotherapy course at Spectrum next year 
Yes yes 
Mm 
Yes 
Mm 
Well that all seems to go with him actually I think 
you think somehow 
dream a lot I suppose in a way 
I 'm just going to top up my tea again if you don't mind 
A distinguished woman but one not to be trusted 
Do you know anybody like that 
Gosh 
A distinguished woman but one not to be trusted 
No I don't think I I can't think of anybody particularly 
Maybe you should be a bit wary 
Yes 
I mean I 'm going to see a play next week with an actress friend of mine in it who is now who 's doing very well now 
thank you very much 
Whether 
Oh 
Who 's that 
J Jo 
Jo Lumley who 's you know doing the Revenger 's Tragedy 
Oh yes 
Oh yes 
Mm 
Mm well 
So I don't know why I thought of her 
Then of course distinguished 
She got 
Just distinguished 
She 's she 's not in the present 
She seems to be in the future 
Mm 
Right 
Well if it 's why the future 
Because that 's what that card 
This is really your present circumstances 
Oh right 
Here and now 
behind my back 
Keep your eyes open 
Yes 
Right 
Right 
Next one 
So you turn up the next card and you put it there I think 
If I remember 
Facing you 
Yes 
Oh I quite like this 
They 're a big one but they want to put it at the top 
OK above as it were 
Two of cups 
Gosh 
What have we got here 
An eagle 
are they trying to exchange 
One is reaching out for the other cup 
One either giving or receiving or exchanging 
At the top of 
Yes 
It represents what you want to make your own but is not your own at present 
It 's also got this 
Are those those uhm a little look like the double snake of the medicine sign 
Yes 
Yes 
I think 
It looks a very good sign 
Ah 
Yes 
Mm 
Looks very balanced to me 
A youth and a maiden 
Caduceus and Hermes and a lion 's head 
Love 
Ooh 
About time too 
Yes 
How long in the future 
Oh well 
That 'll do 
or sympathy and the interrelation of the sexes 
Mm 
Is that your long-term plan 
Oh well 
with with you know with a reasonable mutual exchange and support and all the rest of it 
That sounds good 
Mm 
Yes 
Right 
Six stars 
Scales of justice 
Uhm uhm 
I think it 's money 
Oh is it 
Laying out money 
Oh yes 
And handing it out 
Alms 
Is he feeding the beggars or something 
Or is he 
Yes 
He 's giving it out isn't he 
Presents gifts gratification 
Press kits 
Presents gifts gratification 
Another is attention or vigilance 
Present prosperity 
Present prosperity 
Mmm 
not brilliant 
I 'm not in the bl I 'm not in the red but I 'm uhm 
Well perhaps you 're giving too much to other people 
Giving too much away 
I I certainly am in terms of time and attention 
Four wands 
Mm 
Again that 's a good a very good positive card 
There 's flowers and cheerfulness and garlands and all sorts of things 
I like the idea of the castle 
And even if it 's upside down the meaning remains the same 
That 's a good card 
Doesn't say so 
No 
there 
Mm 
Mm 
And right there 's something the next one is about some current that 's coming into action 
The future 
Yes 
Agreed 
Confirmation in this hand isn't there 
Mm 
So far 
Uh the the woman the weeping woman in a boat being and ghastly things like that which I remember 
What else is she apart from mother 
I mean is it like 
Oh yes 
That one 
She 's material plenty 
Again 
Ah 
Well maybe I 'm going to win the football pools this weekend 
Opulence generosity magnificence security liberty 
Oh well 
They 'll do 
please 
Mm 
Right that 's coming in to your way in the future 
No no 
OK 
Football pools will come 
A reclamation of that 
That 's an interesting idea 
Mm 
Yes 
All right 
One one goes down here now 
D does this top half of the deck uhm disappear altogether 
We 're only interested in that 
Right 
Yes 
That next to it or 
Oh the tower that looks a bit 
Oh dear 
Oh 
It 's uhm 
Is it 
it looks more energetic than the rest of them 
It 's uhm it 's your opinion of yourself that one isn't it 
Oh 
Needs improving 
There 's a crown being toppled off the top 
I don't like that 
I want it back on 
Oh unless it 's sh shedding worthless bits 
being chucked out 
Oh yes it 's a dipping a rebirth 
It 's a re it 's a rebirth sign 
Exactly 
Oh wonderful 
yes 
what are they talking about this 
Yeah 
Course I do 
That 's good 
If you so desire 
yes 
Uhm wh wh wh what were we going to do 
Sorry 
again 
Pardon 
Uhm 
I 'm completely lost now 
yes 
that Alistair doesn't accept he can't move straight to vote until we 've debated the amendment 
can he 
Right 
Then 
Then 
Oh no no no no no 
No not at all 
against it 
two and three-quarter hours of word meeting by word 
Yeah 
No 
Right uh 
Mhm 
Do you think anyone will call quorum 
I don't honestly know 
I mean I know I 'm not and Neil Taylor isn't going to be 
so maybe one of his Tories will call quorum 
so 
Is she the chairman of the Conservatives now 
Yeah 
Therese Coffey 
Yeah 
And so I don't know 
Are you sure no-one 's going to hear this tape except us 
Well no 
This person over in the Survey of English Usage is subscribe transcribing it 
Oh right 
But only But the names are changed and things like that so then they won't know 
Has 
Yeah 
Because Therese Coffey 's a bit one-or-two-words-whispered 
I don't know if I ought to say this 
Pardon 
yes 
I didn't realise she was Chairman of the Conservatives 
Gosh 
She was since well since December onwards since the A G M onwards 
Mm 
Was she 
Ah 
You didn't realise 
No 
Well you a you probably realised last night 
Uhm the young lady sitting next to you uhm Marianne Burr was wearing the T-shirt you see 
and e e e everybody 
The T-shirt 
cos before I didn't realise 
I didn't realise Marianne Burr was 
Everybody came out of the woodwork last night uh 
Mm 
Cameing Coming out I think was definite 
Yes 
So I 'm so I 'm wearing my pink T-shirt and coming out too 
Yeah 
It 's a worrying amount actually of people round Christian round the council table in the Christian Union 
I thought oh God 
You 're almost a majority in fact 
Very sad isn't it 
Mm 
I 'm afraid they don't always vote the way you want them to though cos I was noticing this 
your your report about how you should have the meetings removed at the beginning 
Several members of the Christian Union voted for Marianne 's proposal 
Oh yes 
Did they indeed 
Mhm 
Oh dear 
They were up there 
Oh 
And I thought like hold on you 're wearing the T-shirt 
You 're not supposed to vote like that 
So you do what Nina and I say 
No 
Mm 
Yes uhm 
Who 's head of Christian Union 
Uh David Vincent 
Oh no 
Geography second year 
He 's also a member of the Union council 
What a worrying man he is 
He 's got these really wild staring eyes as if he 's possessed by something 
Well it 's quite quite commonplace for C U people I think isn't it 
Mm 
Are you going grey 
Poss I possibly am actually you know with this work 
Yeah 
I think you might be 
I thought this the other day 
Great 
there might be an amendment 
There might not be an amendment uhm but s seven minutes for seven minutes against 
if you can could you call me as opposing speaker please unless you see somebody else jumping up and down and uh 
I 'm only asking you as a favour and 
Mm 
Yeah 
Aled 
Aled I 'll say whoever puts their hand up first 
And don't stick your hands under my nose like you usually do 
Well I shan't be sitting next to you so I can't can I 
All right I 'm going 
You didn't sit next to me in Union council 
What did I do wrong 
Nothing 
Nothing 
Had I been hassling you so much you couldn't bear it 
No 
Nothing 
Oh dear 
Shame 
No no no no no 
It wasn't anything uhm It was nothing personal about it or anything 
It 's just uhm I felt that if I stick if I kept sitting next to you I 'd keep on sticking my hand up under your face all the time which is most impolite 
What do you mean 
Who 's going to decide when the U G M starts today 
No cos I 'll be there at one 
Are you going there at one today 
Oh right 
Well it 'll be you deciding when the meeting starts but I 'd highly recommend that it starts at about ooh ten past one 
Mm 
Why 
Is that when it 's the wrong thing 
No 
You 're not very consistent here 
at three minutes past five 
U G Ms are never quorate 
No 
But council was quorate at three minutes past five 
Yeah 
But that 's not the point 
I mean four of the five sabbaticals were missing 
That 's irrelevant 
It isn't irrelevant 
They have no other status in cou in council 
Well 
Just the same as it was pointless to have it without uhm I don't know the the President of the Medics uhm 
starting U G Ms before I get there 
No 
We haven't done that 
Well I did it once though only once 
Mm 
But you have haven't you 
Yes 
Mm 
Yes 
Well when you were very very late uhm 
Mm 
Yeah 
About twelve minutes past 
Oh it 's him 
Let him in 
Who is it 
Taylor 
Uh can I pick the boxes up please 
Hello 
Neil 
Thank you 
How are you both 
Fine 
I 'm very fine 
Good 
I did think that the meeting last night was slightly excessive 
I mean mean uhm 
Does Does shouting a lot and making lots of noise really have much effect uh in terms of intercession 
or 
I think it does actually 
Yeah 
I think I think equally you can do it quietly 
I 
You do 
Gives you a sense of community and a sense of spirit doesn't it 
What noise 
Mm 
positive stuff 
Eh 
Well 
Have you got a black pen 
Uhm 
Not really 
No 
What 's this 
There 's one 
I think it is 
Yes 
Sounded like a sense of the ecstatic to me rather than a sense of of uhm 
Jesus 
God 
Mm 
Him as well 
Mm 
Yes 
Are you coming tonight to the meeting 
No 
I 'm not coming tonight to the thing 
I 'm going to the all night sit-in 
Remember 
But can't you go to the sit-in later 
No 
Yes 
You can actually 
I don't want to come to a Christian Union meeting tonight 
Oh you don't want to come to this 
I 'm perfectly happy for you to clap and sing and be as loud as you want and if it makes you feel good then I 'm really happy 
But I don't want to join in 
We 're not going to clap and sing tonight 
No no 
There 's none of that 
Th There 's not not clapping and singing tonight 
There 's th Thank the Lord there is going to be no clapping and singing tonight 
There 's going to be one or two solo performances and then we 're going to have a guest speaker saying why you should become a Christian 
Oh 
Aled why are you against the clapping and singing 
See 
Aled 's not against the clapping and singing 
Yes 
Because when I left the meeting last night they were half an hour before they finished and I had a headache 
Oo 
It doesn't matter 
No 
I know 
It does you good 
It most probably does 
We did some good praying 
We We bound some evil spirits last night 
It was really good 
You did 
Yeah 
Yes 
And once was enough 
I thought Alistair was in the bar 
Who 
I 'm being sarcastic 
She 's She 's being nasty 
Yes 
She 's being nasty 
But you just told me he was talking out of his backside 
That 's worse 
Why should it only be last night 
Come on 
When he was saying that the constitution was only advisory 
Well it is only advisory 
The students have have said this is how they want it run 
that this is how they want it 
Mm 
It 's advisory 
Well it is advisory 
No one else has read it so it has to be advisory doesn't it 
You consult it when you feel like it 
So people are ignoring what the students want then 
Well yeah 
By and large 
I If if you must put it like that 
But we are students so we 've got a right to say ourselves you see 
in the absence of eight thousand others 
No 
Yes 
But but 
No 
No 
Just because students in previous years have wanted that doesn't mean that we can't interpret it the way we want to 
No 
The majority opinion of a genuine meeting which is how we are all bound has said that they want it done this way 
and if the students 
How long ago 
uhm seven months ago 
Right 
Far too long 
They all are Neil 
They 're all representative Neil 
Well it didn't reach the quorum level 
Yes it did Neil 
The standing orders say that there 's a qu it was quorated unless deemed to be otherwise 
So it was quorate 
There were two hundred and fifty people at least in those meetings 
No 
That 's not true 
That 's rubbish Aled 
Bye 
Bye Bye 
Well do shut the door 
He 's coming back 
Yeah I know 
sound travels 
Uhm yes 
And uhm well anyway is there anything else that you would like to know 
or have I sh sort of pontificated 
I still don't know why you don't like happy clappy songs 
Maybe they give you a sense of belonging to the sh Spirit 
Well no no 
I I do I do I do like happy clappy songs but I don't like them for three hours non-stop 
That 's all 
the day 's ills 
My spiritual e 
Filling you with the golden light of Jesus and things like that 
Yes yes 
I know but I have other means of uhm of spiritual expression other than those 
Uh I 'm not that kind of Christian I 'm afraid 
Why wasn't Kate at the thing last night 
She 's a very dodgy Christian 
I have to say this 
Possibly 
Yes 
Very dodgy 
John came back with us last night talking of dodgy Christians 
Yes 
But who are we to judge 
Not me 
No exactly 
Was uhm John appearing distinctly sort of uneasy when uhm Kate was uhm all round him 
yes 
He 's desperately desperately in love 
I wouldn't worry 
Mm 
Wu w w one obviously doesn't wish to make young gentlemen feel uncomfortable and all that uh uhm 
Mm 
It 's his problem 
Well possibly yes 
Possibly 
Course it is 
Yeah 
What was I going to say 
Oh yes 
uhm asking me 
shouldn't the E and R officer have a campaigning role and join in with N U S campaigns 
And then I looked up in the standing orders and there 's nothing about my doing campaigns whatsoever 
No 
But you could 
I could yes 
But he was saying it as if it was my job to do it whereas of course it isn't 
And I showed him the standing orders afterwards and saying 
here Mark where 
and he 's been chair of the N S O committee 
and he should know what the standing orders and what 's in them 
No no no no no 
that you got rid of this 
Just because you 're chair of the N S O committee doesn't necessarily mean you know what it says in the standing orders 
and you know what they are 
But but you don't actually know exactly what it says 
I have hordes of wonderful men around me who tell me what to do all the time 
I don't need to read them 
What few wonderful men 
And Mark 
And Mark 
And Alan 
Alan 's read them 
Oh right 
Alan 's so lovely isn't he 
I wouldn't actually say any of the four are wonderful but never mind 
Uh 
Alan 's really sweet 
Yes but 
Oh don't be nasty 
No no no 
How can you do a survey of English language uses when I 'm eating Twiglets 
Well I suppose there must be some sort of uhm 
Is there is a sort of can you transcribe scrunch scrunch scrunch 
I don't know 
I mean uh I dare say the people who 're on the other end of the tape will have a go at doing it uh 
So what I mean what is it 
What 's it for 
No idea 
I have no idea 
it 's they they 're building up a corpus of uhm conversations in English so that they can uhm 
I dunno don't know 
I have no idea 
Uhm a study of the grammar and structures of English so 
I heard you speaking Welsh yesterday 
It was really nice 
Oh dear 
Oh right 
I was listening and fascinated 
You were listening 
Were you understanding it 
No not a word of course 
No 
But I was still listening 
Right 
Oh 
That 's my mo well it 's not my mother tongue 
I 'm bi bilingual so I suppose 
I thought it was your mother tongue 
it 's it 's debatable whether one can say that if one is raised in a bilingual community that either language is one 's mother tongue 
But does your do your parents speak in Welsh 
Yes 
Well then it 's your mother tongue then isn't it because your mother speaks it 
Well she also speaks English 
No but at home what do they speak 
Welsh 
Right 
They all speak Welsh 
Yes 
How do they speak in Northampton 
Northampton 
Not Northampton 
North uh Nottingham 
What do they speak 
Yes 
They say things like acey-pacey 
Acey-pacey 
Right 
So funny 
I haven't heard that phrase for a long time 
Right 
Sorry 
Anyway I 'm just some of the uhm Labour posters uhm they talk about British Telecom 's monopoly 
Sorry 
Thank you 
Yes 
That 's interesting really isn't it 
It 's an opinion I suppose a point of view 
there 's no choice 
Uhm but it 's not strictly speaking true is it 
There are other telecommunications companies in this country 
Right 
Yeah 
The large one being Mercury 
what could be done about it 
That 's interesting 
Cos they 're all stamped union-approved so I thought 
What does it say 
Uh sh shall I go and get one 
I mean there are hundreds 
Yes 
I 'll be back in a minute 
Thank you 
I see 
It 's a bit tedious really isn't it 
Uhm a terribly boring poster 
uhm 
Mm 
not untrue 
This adjective here is a matter of opinion 
Uhm 
I agree 
It 's just the monopoly business that I thought 
Well it 's a duopoly in this country isn't it really 
Uhm in Brit Brit British Telecom 's share of the of the duopoly makes one hundred pounds ' profit each second 
Uhm 
Yeah 
I was just wondering if it was worth complaining to whoever was in charge or not bothering 
Honest it 's hardly worth you the breath I shouldn't have thought somehow 
You you you you 've seen the uhm the Labour posters that are going round at the moment uhm on the on the billboards 
Probably 
It 's about time with the Tories or something isn't it 
Various well yes various things 
yes 
So I I as I say I mean let 's just j just take it at face value 
No-one 's going to make any fuss about it basically 
everybody ignores them anyway 
doesn't really matter 
Thank God 
Are you going to be at the U G M today 
I am indeed 
That should be fun 
Are you going to this sleep-in or not 
Well I brought a sleeping bag with me 
Well I brought a blanket 
Uhm I don't have a sleeping bag unfortunately 
Oh right 
No 
I got my sleeping bag uhm so in case I need to be there for some reason 
Then I can I thought I 'd have my sleeping bag in the office and go over every couple of hours 
Check everything 's OK nobody 's causing a riot you know 
Uhm 
Yeah 
What what are they actually are people going to actually be able to work 
Are they actually going to be able to use books in there 
Yes 
It 's it 's only going to be the Donaldson part of the library open probably 
Which is that 
Is that the 
that 's the economics philosophy linguistics history of art fine art 
That sort of area 
Economics one 
Yeah 
So you can look at lots of books on economics you see if you want to 
Oh I mean I was going to do my economics tonight anyway 
What time 's the actual library shut because I want to get a book out overnight 
Ah right 
Quarter to nine 
Quarter to nine 
Right 
Is is the time the issue desk shuts 
Yeah 
OK 
Well I have to get over there for then 
Yes right 
Well I I doubt we 'll be able to borrow books after quarter to nine uhm 
Uhm even though we 'll be there I suppose 
Uhm no 
I doubt if it 's a problem 
if it gets through or not you know sort of I 'll make a speech against it you know 
but cos it 's cos it 's not going to affect us 
I mean it 's it 's everybody in college is on our side 
So 
Right 
uhm 
Never mind 
Anyway who speaks in your next the next E and R 
I don't know 
How many people are hacking for your position 
Well there are five who 've got forms with me so far 
Really 
For E and R 
Mm 
Hattie Tinge 
Nicole 
Ah I thought Nicole was going to do P and C 
No 
That 's Ken 
Mhm 
Yeah 
No 
there 's a couple of others so it should be fun 
Yeah 
I possibly think Tony won't bother 
Yeah 
Because he didn't realise Ross was backing 
Right 
Uhm so I think he may not have the confidence to go ahead as it were 
Oh I think he should 
I mean I think he should stand anyway 
Yeah 
You know 
I mean there 's uh you don't lose anything by standing do you 
I haven't seen him 
He 's been away this week which is a bit stupid 
Yeah 
Well well I mean he 's away this week I think 
Reading week 
Mm 
Yes 
Yeah 
How about the other positions 
Have they been carved up or 
No 
who gets the posts 
Well 
Yeah 
I suppose so 
Well I dunno don't know 
I dunno don't know 
S and S is hotting up isn't it 
Well he 's got three so far 
Uh is it Heather Hedge Haddycollet that 's hotting up really 
Mr Taylor 
Well I 'm sure it adds spice to the issue 
uh charismatic character who uhm 
No 
But he 's famous isn't he 
He 's famous yes yes but his fame has worked against him occasionally mm and so uh 
Yeah 
I dunno don't know 
How 's the mission going 
OK 
OK OK OK 
Big meeting tonight seven-thirty in the Bloomsbury 
Come along 
Bring your friends 
I 'm actually going to the Chemistry dinner 
Ah right 
So I 'm afraid I 'll have to decline 
Right 
OK 
I go to my own religious meetings anyway 
Which religious meetings are these 
Well I mean I 'm a Catholic so I go to church on Sundays 
Oh yeah but this is the Christian Union 
This is this this is the united uh front of college Christians rather than just one denomination 
We 'd go around 
I suppose so but I 'm not very ecumenical I must admit 
Oh dear 
The Pope and nothing else 
It 's awful isn't it 
Well it 's not exactly the Pope but uh I know what you mean yes 
yes 
Yeah 
OK 
Anyway I 've got to go because I 've got a lecture so 
What fun 
What are you doing 
I 'm looking at your papers 
Oh yeah 
So oh good 
I 'm glad that you 're going to admit that anyway 
Well I think they 're interesting subjects 
I 've seen them all before 
I daresay you have John 
in my disposal of paper 
Oh yeah 
I 've got a big bag of uh recyclal recyclable sort of three-or-four-words some time 
Emma 
To Kathy Klein 
Oh 
Can't I just dump them in here and leave them for her 
No 
It 's not the way that it 's done 
Now try 
What 's that 
Discussion tomorrow 
Well it 's not a discussion 
It 's for information 
Well no 
Well no what 
So what else is on the agenda tomorrow morning 
Not a lot Jimmy 
the declaration of nominations meeting for the year 
Oh yeah 
Can I see the nomination forms please 
How many 
Well two saxophones 
I 'll take them to committee tonight 
What 's up with Lee at the moment then 
Do they have to sign on the back 
No 
See they 're three-or-four-words by twelve thirty tomorrow morning 
What happens if they commend declaration 
Can they appoint me as their agent 
They can't appoint you as their agent because you haven't been on the committee 
So 
That doesn't actually say I can't 
That means you can't be impartial 
Are you voting 
I haven't been impartial Aled 
I 've never heard that one before 
Uhm the N S O Committee 
That 's not much use 
How old 's that 
Oh are you going to print an agenda to let Tina circulate 
just so I can cover myself and with twenty-four hour notice 
now where was that stupid bit 
Yeah 
D' you want me to find it for you 
Well you won't find it name 
You 'll just look at other things 
What 's this 
That 's my message to Peter 
Mm 
These are old papers down here 
Are you planning it 
and a half 
That 's nice 
Eighth of November that 's E R 
And anything else attached to it 
Mm 
No 
No 
You 're right 
What 's this 
Here we are 
Oh that 's where it is 
Oh thank you Neil 
Oh that 's quite extraordinary 
Oh 
Ah 
Uhm 
No they 're not 
Does it look like it 
Simon typed them himself 
Yes probably 
Yeah 
It 's uhm quite useful really 
Uhm 
Yes 
Oh those are the uhm those are Alastair Black 's if you 're interested 
Probably yeah 
I dunno don't know 
sabs 
Nobody knew what the sabs should be doing 
That 's quite interesting 
Well everybody thinks they know what the sabs should be doing 
And everybody thought that they did when they came in 
whether they do now or not is another thing 
Anyway I 'd better go 
Had you 
I 've got to buy some plants today 
Right 
Oh plants 
Yeah 
Mm 
Of course 
You didn't you wouldn't happen to leave it lying around on the table by any chance would you 
It 's lying around somewhere else at the moment 
Is it 
Who forms the the axis of the social committee 
Guy or gal 
Uh depending on whether you want course or department listed 
Am I allowed to do that 
Well it 's up to you 
Well would it be ruled out of order 
On what grounds 
Oh dunno don't know 
names that aren't proposers and seconds 
Yeah 
Yes 
Nobody else 
Not even the Provost 
No 
I don't know 
I can't remember 
We desperately need a Christian to go for the A W don't we 
Where is it 
Where is it 
These boxes in here 
Is Tanya going to go for E and R 
You made her bottle out didn't you 
I don't think she is but I mean 
and that means that she 'll bottle out 
I dunno don't know do I 
I haven't seen him all last week 
finding the time to get people to sign his forms isn't he 
What he needs is three-or-four-words 
It is knocking on a bit then 
Getting getting sorted in about three days ' time 
Well 
Does he how many of the E and R people now are how many people 's going for E and R 
God knows 
Six boxes three-or-four-words 
Can't what about the Provost 
I can't say the Provost wants to allocate a number of rooms in my manifesto 
Unless he proposed or seconded you I don't think you can 
Should be 
That means they could be but you wouldn't bother 
I don't know 
And I 'd use my discretion if necessary at that time 
Depends on who 's done it 
And what 's that big thing 
the ballot box 
Oh can I put can I put Louise in that one please 
Not yet 
Wait until after uhm tomorrow night 
Why 
Because uhm I can't accept names until uhm until I know who 's standing who 's seconding whom 
and uh 
Not even in pencil 
Not even in pencil because Miss Kate MacPherson would bash me on the head with a three-or-four-words because she 's having first priority 
Yeah 
But she won't want to be voted away will she 
No 
We need to pray for me 
What 's the nature of the sickness 
Don't know 
Well it 's serious 
I think I 'm going to have some diarrhoea but I haven't found the food checks yet 
Is there any way you can shut the Bloomsbury ballot box on Wednesday 
On what grounds 
Well it 's been very crowded there 
It 's not usually 
Safety measures and all that 
You mean that all those Christian Union people pouring out of their prayer meeting will be going immediately to the Bloomsbury ballot box and causing a stampede 
I don't think so somehow 
No 
I was thinking more in terms of all the sporties causing a stampede 
I mean would we would well we don't want them to be injured just before they start the match do we 
no 
No 
So it might be wise to shut the ballot box at lunch time 
that there should be an open ballot box at that time 
to wish to question the decision of the N S O committee 
Sure 
I being a mere functionary and a servant 
Well the thing is you 've got staff shortages at the time and you can't possibly put somebody on the ballot box 
If there were staff shortages then possibly yes 
but uh 
Well it 's not exactly honest desires as far as I can see 
Mm 
Anyway I must go I think 
Mm 
according to What 's On 
Mm 
According to What 's On 
something very strange 
But I must go anyway 
Bye bye 
Mm 
See you later on 
Yeah 
I 'm pleasantly surprised 
Yeah three-words-mumbled 
Mhm 
Mmm 
Help yourself 
better than Justin 
No you don't 
What you do 
you get a cold and you blow your nose 
and you sort of throw it at the bin and it misses you know 
And then when you blow your be nose 
Yeah yeah yeah 
That 's right yeah 
Yeah 
All over 
Get value for money out of Kleenex 
Yeah 
Yeah 
And then you go get up and you go into the other rooms so you leave them there 
The they 're all scrunched up and 
Yeah I do actually when I 've got a cold 
Are you are you living in Camden now 
Is that OK 
Sorry 
you know 
Is it OK 
Yeah 
council flat 
But it 's just a little small block sort of six flats in it 
You know where the Palace is 
If you go up that road it 's just at the bottom of that 
So it 's pretty central 
Mm 
Yeah 
Mm 
Yeah 
Oh right 
I mean we went we went to a party once just behind the Camden Palace 
Do you remember 
Yeah 
Oh 
Oh they 're nice 
that 's that 's on the same road as that Steve lives then isn't it 
Somewhere along there isn't he 
Oh 
Ah the one Sarah 's going out with 
Yeah 
Yeah 
He used to live in the flat opposite 
Oh 
Oh opposite 
Oh I see 
Yeah 
And I lived in the same flat a couple of years ago 
Oh right 
Mm right 
I think about twelve years ago 
a single man 
about half an hour 
Mm 
But they were giving them away like really easily then 
How long 's he been there 
Twelve years 
Yeah 
But he just sublets sort of the bedrooms 
He lives in this huge living room 
That 's that 's the place which he lives in 
It 's it 's shared but 
Oh right 
Is that sort of official or 
No 
Well no 
But a lot of people do that sort of thing you know 
I 'm sure 
we 're not supposed to have Becky at our place 
To survive 
No 
Why 
Because we 've got a mortgage and uhm 
You pay different rates when you 've got when you rent properties 
Yeah 
That 's right 
Well you well you pay more 
Mm 
Yeah 
But I mean she only what pays about te tw twenty quid a week or something doesn't she 
Yeah 
Twenty quid 
Yeah but uh 
Oh Jesus 
Was that really hot 
It 's quite comfortable 
Sort of left it there in the air you know 
Well I was putting it down 
Well I was waiting for Ruth to 
Balanced it on the wine bottles 
I was waiting for 
Waiting for me to do what 
To move your hand and then I could have put it down 
Just waiting for the pixies to come and sort of 
Can you pass the s the sour cream please 
Ruth said something about Sarah and Steve having a pagan wedding 
Oh Mark stop it 
She just told me in the car 
I thought you I thought I thought you knew about it 
No 
I forgot to tell Justin 
We all forgot to say anything you know and he wouldn't 
A big thing of it 
Yeah 
A big thing of it mmm 
From from months ago 
Yeah 
Really 
Yeah 
There 's a reception 
Well I don't know 
Just some sort of 
Yeah 
couple of years I suppose 
I think it de I think it depends really on how far you want to take it doesn't it 
Mm 
Yeah absolutely 
Uhm 
Bloody hope not 
while she 's getting married 
Mhm 
So so is it 
I mean is it 
Well 
Like are parents involved and things 
From what I can gather it 's a small like 
No 
She hasn't talked to them 
Freak 
or something 
Well it 's not exactly uhm 
Pass the sour cream please 
Yes 
he 's always worried about Sarah getting too serious with her boyfriends 
Mhm 
Yeah 
Sure 
he wouldn't be too happy 
That sounds like my mum 
It 's not as if it 's legally binding or anything 
That 's just it 
you know this and that and 
Well it 's not going to do any harm is it 
No 
It 's not going to do any harm to anyone 
No 
But then again why should marriage b if you look at it marriage shouldn't really do any harm anyway 
It should only do good 
But well you see it 's not 
Well the idea behind it anyway 
I don't know 
It just seems to me that they 're 
she is l she 
His early twenties 
About twenty-three 
twenty-three 
Yeah 
Excuse me 
Well it 's interesting 
she seems to be quite sort of 
She said oh well you know if it doesn't work out it doesn't work out sort of thing 
I know but that 's like 
That 's just like a cop out 
I that 's what I mean 
Most pagans who get married yeah they have a pagan ceremony 
but they 're doing the marriage not for fun not for a novelty value not just for their friends for entertainment 
And to reinforce that commitment while without without necessarily sharing the same beliefs on the whole as Christians 
I mean most pagan marriages like I think ninety per cent that 's what happens 
Yeah 
Mm 
Yeah I know 
You can go down 
that 
She 'll tell you that 
I mean she does uhm 
Most of them are in London 
Well that 's what I said to Sarah 
look you realise this is a commitment 
But then you know if you te 
Another thing 
I mean if if you 're going to say 
if it doesn't work it doesn't work 
It 's all very well 
but I mean if you haven't got enough commitment to even try and make it work when it starts going wrong there 's not much not much point in doing it is there 
It 's not so much of a commitment if you take the registry side out 
Oh God no 
Yeah 
That 's probably not what she meant you know 
It 's a question of faith 
Maybe not 
Yeah 
I don't know 
I da I 've I 've no idea 
I mean I just 
I haven't seen much of Sarah recently anyway 
I didn't say much when she said it 
I said oh 
you know 
When are they doing that 
Mm 
Mid-April sometime 
April the ninth 
Really 
April the sixteenth 
Well I hope it works 
Wish them the best 
Mm 
I remain sceptical from my own personal experiences 
Yeah yeah 
sort of 
It 's uh pretty quick 
Mm 
I 'll have that one 
Taco sandwich 
No 
I 'll have that one 
Taco sandwich 
Yeah yeah 
You can get more in 
Just more sides to ooze out of 
Mm 
I 'm well impressed with this though 
See I mean you shouldn't have seen all the preparation bits 
I should have like just whipped up this amazing meal 
and you 'd have gone God Mark 
you must have spent hours slaving over the stove 
And I would have said yeah you know 
Mm 
Leicester Square 
Taco what 
Taco bar 
It was like Tacos and Mexican food but it was like McDonald 's 
It was sort of take-away tacos 
Mex Mexican food like burritos and tacos and that sort of thing 
Stuff like that 
What 's that 
Mm 
Where 's that 
Well it 's closed down now 
It was sort of between Leicester Square and Piccadily Circus 
or Debbie 's birthday thing 
Yeah 
Is it the nineteenth or something 
Yeah 
Cos we were going to go and see Love Hate that day 
Mhm 
See if they 'll provide some vegetarian food 
Mm 
See I don't really know much about Mexican food 
as a rule there 's that much meat but most places can accommodate for you 
You know they don't mind you know 
I do it 's not much of a fuss 
Mm 
No 
You know they 'll just say 
They must do vegetarian stuff 
everywhere 's doing vegetarian stuff 
They 'd be stupid not to 
There 's so many 
Mm 
Mm 
Everyone does at least one dish don't they 
Yeah 
There 's so many veggies 
Or you can uhm order like a meat and three veg without the meat 
They should let you do that 
Yeah 
If the worst comes to the worst 
for giving up your time Paul 
Well for for giving me the time 
Contributing 
Contributing the time 
Thank you very much anyway because there 's no money in it 
something else 
Something like this 
Uhm 
Go on 
Lovely 
Of course like the others I 'll speak to you 're totally anonymous right 
You 're reading this aren't you 
Yeah 
who talks 
So you 're anonymous so you can say what you like 
I 'll just put a general question 
Mm 
a potential father 
Uhm 
Leave that 
We 're coming back 
Gah aren't you being vague 
Uhm well uh if you could just remind me for example what age he was when what age you were when he left and 
can't remember 
Don't remember much about him from those days 
Uhm I 've got 
and one senses that he was in the way of that 
Mm 
Right 
You you 've anticipated my next question 
were you aware of any fee of having any particular feelings about him when you were a child aged say less than eight 
Yeah 
Do you want any more 
Mm 
What do you remember 
Mm 
I remember 
The flies that were on the pavement 
not being allowed to have guns when I was a kid uhm toy guns 
typical day 
Mm 
Mm 
OK 
Don't let me let me make it a bit easier 
OK 
Well 
OK 
there 
These are the dos and these are the don'ts 
From those cards 
No 
No 
a drunkard 
No 
No 
I don't know 
Very very common failing 
finally 
No 
No 
Well 
kind of question 
Yeah 
But I don't want to need teaching to be grown up 
Mm 
And 
Very astute 
Uhm 
I 'm very astute but I 'm anticipating your questions 
No no 
No 
anyway 
Mm 
Mm 
liberal you know 
very uncommon 
not having a father around although my father probably wouldn't have thin 
things would have probably been the same 
he he was around 
I I remember I I got a girl pregnant when I was about seventeen and he was great 
He he uhm sorted that out 
Mm 
But did you you did see him then for a while 
Yeah 
Oh yeah 
How often was uh from time to time 
Not very often initially 
Ah he used to look after me sometimes 
Mm 
Mm 
No just one off 
D' you want me to expand on that 
what were you expecting that they weren't like 
Hang on 
Well I didn't know what to expect in that sense 
sex 
could I couldn't 
well 
couldn't 
then I fell madly in love when I was about seventeen with this girl this seventeen or sixteen-year-old girl 
And uh I won't go through the whole story 
I I just didn't know what to do 
I didn't know how to get it get it from where it was into 
It was just like 
And I couldn't perform 
she didn't want to continue the relationship not because of that necessarily 
and win her back 
uhm 
Mm 
Really 
Mm 
Now you 've you 've anticipated my next question again because my next question was how do you think you viewed women at that time and how does that compare with your views today 
Oh 
sex objects 
with anybody 
this made it I 've had two broken marriages 
and to have a satisfying ongoing sexual relationship with anybody 
Mm 
Mm 
was influenced by being a single parent 
you know on a secretary 's wages which was what we had 
It 's the biggest library I 've ever seen 
How does it compare in size to Martin 's hall 
You 've seen Martin 's hall haven't you 
Well it 's about the s 
Yes 
It 's comparable I would think but with a lower ceiling 
Lower 
Lower than Martin 's 
Gosh 
I think I mean his ceiling 's not not high 
It 's a long a long narrow room 
And uhm Jane might be interested 
uhm she might be interested in hiring it out 
Oh I think they 're pretty civilized people 
How would she cater 
I don't think she 'd do any catering 
No 
I mean Martin would ha have to do the catering 
you 'd have to hire out the kitchen too 
She has a huge range in her kitchen 
That 's all she has 
Thank you 
Thank you 
But I 'll mention it to Martin 
But wouldn't she have the same problems 
There 's still the 
you 've got fire exit signs 
Yes 
But couldn't they be her guests and couldn't they be Martin Nichols ' guests 
Well no they can't be 
They 're paying money for this thing 
I don't know 
I think when you have a certain number of people uh uhm members of the public in certain in a place 
Martin has no proper fire exits 
And the thir And the third one which was a true exit you have to you ha ha have to have gone with a band to get to it 
So I mean it was really hopeless 
We 
We have We have French windows in this room 
There are lots of windows 
It 's on the ground floor 
So I I 'm not sure that it might not uhm fulfil the requirements 
We had We had this 
Wouldn't work 
Well you 'd still need a licence 
If you three-or-four-words you need a licence 
happens to bed and breakfasts 
Well you get 
Well 
A licence for functions 
Mm 
What about music then 
Well we were wondering about that 
so it wasn't public 
Mm 
But a music club 's not public you see 
You know i music club is like a private f function 
People are invited to come to the music club 
Nobody knows about it 
The problem with that 
Yeah 
yes 
Well I 'll give Martin a call and pass on her phone number if that 's all right 
I don't think it 's anything like large enough but 
Well he might have to have a smaller concert 
up there 
Yes 
Yes 
I don't think they can hold a dance there 
I don't think the floor 's good enough 
But it 's a beautiful parquet floor 
Mm 
Dancing in stilettos 
That hall of Martin 's is quite big actually 
I mean it look it doesn't look enormous ye 
Have you seen the inside of it 
No 
I 've never been 
With the nickel 
I 've only ever walked round his house 
Lizzie 's 
Y You 've seen it haven't you 
You went round there and saw 
Yes 
I have 
Well if you don't mind me giving Martin her phone number 
Mm 
Well I 'm sure it would be all right with Martin 
Martin is a quite well-known person round here 
It 's quite possible they 've heard of him anyway 
Yes 
Yes 
I 'll tell Jane that you 've done that 
As the local eccentric 
In fact I could give her a ring this afternoon 
You know what they call him in the music trade 
What do they call him 
Just that 
Just Martin 
Does he know this 
Yes 
I think so 
Probably 
Poor old whinnier 
What is he whinning whinnying about 
Who Winston 
No 
M Martin of course 
Well he must have known he was s sailing close to the wind when he built that place 
He must have done 
somehow he 
Presumably one of his unsatisfied customers must have shopped him 
and did you know that 
And Martin said well you know we can't do well we can't do everything at once Peter 
We 've got to make these concerts happen 
We 're going to get on to that 
three-or-four-words 
Really 
Kno He knows He knows who shopped him 
He doesn't know personally who it is 
I mean he 'd probably recognise him again 
Mm 
Bit ungrateful wasn't it 
Obviously he didn't enjoy the concert 
They 're usually sold out 
And they 're expensive 
Mm 
Is that his main source of income 
His only source of income 
Uh no 
Not really 
But he 'd 
I don't know if he appears in the Newbury guide any more 
His house has been done in the in the sense that it 's got fire doors and fire extinguishers in the right places and fire alarms and everything 
Were you going to be playing in it 
I was going to ask whether we could 've uh put the children up here that night but 
Which night uhm 
But there 's no point now 
Uh Lizzie

Did you know they had an earthquake 
Did you know that camels give you syphilis 
I just cannot be happy 
This thing plugged in 
Is that depressing enough for you 
camel 
That 's not what I heard 
Is this thing plugged in 
Thanks 
Tea 
he makes tea he makes phone calls he makes gets me lollipops 
Look at this 
No wonder you 're chairperson 
Why are you always in such a hurry and looking so hassled 
I am not around for the next two weeks 
that 's all 
I 'm in severe stress work-wise 
I think you 're doing fine 
You 're not you 're not seeing ner seeming nervous or as if you need encouragement to me 
Do you think you need encouragement 
Oh yes 
Come on 
paroxysms 
No 
Should I be ill at ease 
No 
But you were saying I 'm supposed to be encouraging you 
I said I only encourage people who look as though they need it 
You don't look as if you need it 
You look quite happy 
How bothered 
Oh I see what you mean 
Therefore you haven't bothered 
Mm 
No because obviously 
in just this most simple of sort of toy-room terms you can understand that one minute there are two people here the next minute one has gone 
did the active going 
and obviously because you 're with that person more of the time 
But uh uh I I wouldn't discount that entirely 
but I think it 's also not just the usual argument of oh but the child 's with that one and so they think that one is the one that 's in the right 
not she that left with you 
have you considered until now the effects that having an absent father may have had on your childhood 
Tell me about your life 
Sorry 
The effects that 
That having an absent father may have had on your childhood 
Have you considered the influences of it on your childhood 
Yeah 
very single-minded very independent very competitive 
psychological covering up of the truth 
but my assessment of that is that has as much to do with simple economic facts rather than deep-seated Freudian need to prove myself etc etc 
I think that 's more I think that 's heavily overplayed by people 
I think that 's much more straight fact that we didn't have any money 
you wouldn't you wouldn't uh be at school any more 
It wasn't because I wanted to be Prime Minister of England 
it 's just I want to go to school thank you 
Well I mean that 's what I uh 
I was going to say which is true 
which is true to some extent particularly when I was working in the City uh which is highly competitive and highly knife knife-in-the-back uhm you do have to be 
if you 're going to make up for that you have to be smartish 
Mhm 
Mm 
and had you just had not much money all these things would therefore have been true and therefore from what you 're saying having an absent father may had no effect on your childhood whatever 
No 
No because uh of 
No 
listen 
there are three things I 'm saying and they are divided in into two 
One which are irrelevant to talking about the father the deafness in particular 
perhaps just genetically some people are more driven than others 
Right 
That has an effect 
Now on the side to do with the father I 'm saying that many people want to attribute driven competitive personalities to absent fathers 
I 'm saying that while there may be an element of that I think that is often overstated and in fact there was a much more mundane economic result and that and that 
I 'm saying that since all of this would still be here 
Oh but you could just have not had enough money 
Mm 
I understood you the first time 
Yes 
But why would what I 'm saying is why would the why would it be washed away if the father was there 
You could just have had a two parent family where your father was there and you just didn't have enough money so you had to have a scholarship 
Yes 
But he 
Wha what I 'm saying is all those other things 
you could just have had a father who was there but didn't have an enormous amount of money 
But the boy 's loaded 
Well now we 're getting pretty hypothetical 
Well we are getting hypothetical 
but I 'm saying what are the effects do you think of an absent father on your childhood 
and you 're looking at them purely it seems to me in financial terms 
you could have had a hard up father and then 
Ah because there 's big gap between a 
Ah ah ah 
and that is that lots of life is not about reality versus what it what it could have been hypothetically 
it 's about the gap between reality and what it might very realistically have been 
i e if you are born in the Gorbals and there 's absolutely no chance of your having any money well then you grow up as a normal Gorbals-born person 
If however you were born in the Gorbals as an illegitimate child of Lord so-and-so and your mother keeps telling you that Lord so-and-so is around the corner in X Y Z Crescent then that has a marked difference upon the way you see the world 
Right 
All right 
All right 
Uhm 
But that 's your major problem with the absent father problem if if economics is a problem 
You 're saying well supposing you just had a poor father but it 's much more than that 
you 're suffering and you know that had that particular father that you 've got been there you wouldn't be 
and your 
This is all 
And I accept that this is a major area 
that you think any other effects 
I st 
OK 
Uhm ce ce well uh just to recap 
there was a third one I said before 
Well the whole the whole drivenness of working hard 
I know 
All right drivenness 
OK 
Well both 
Well un undoubtedly which is an area I 'm sure you want to come to you will notice that I 've never married 
And uhm sho and there 's no question in my mind that uhm what happened has had an effect a marked effect on that 
the key figure that always pulsates in my mind when I think about the subject is married for six years divorce court for eighteen 
In fact you know you know without sounding smug about it uhm I did very nicely thank you 
so what you know 
to me that is not a factor uh and I think a lot of people use it and overplay it 
But the factor about not getting married is definitely that 
the fourth point which is more subliminal it 's 
you probably would never get me to admit to it 
Some of that 's probably true 
You notice that I put spontaneous on my 
What 's very interesting is when I re when after this is written up when I 'm reading over it then I I see more in it than I can initially taking notes 
OK 
We 're going on 
OK 
I 've only got five more minutes 
Have you really 
Exactly 
Mm 
I think so 
Well you must be be slightly more succinct then 
Uh sorry 
I don't know what you mean 
Do I have a mnemonic 
This is a this is a 
No 
I I mean 
Sort of tag for that or what 
How do you mean 
I mean an event 
and your views about your father 
That 's what I meant 
Yeah 
oh yeah Triumph Two Thousands 
Lotus usually with numbers on it would appear 
I mean these are really just the two memories that I last had of him up until springtime last year which I 'm sure I 'll come to 
at school 
And that 's sort of the good side 
The bad side 
I always remember being taken out to tea once 
And uhm he said now the good news uh I just I have some really good news for you you see 
as aged fourteen I think splurting the soup back into my or or the tea back into my cup 
I mean for example 
Yeah 
What 
In horror or amazement 
Uh uh well uh horror 
I don't know 
everything 
I don't really know that I analysed exactly why I sprayed it back into my cup 
So I suppose I didn't then have an immediate oh my god this means that he 's really distancing himself 
but perhaps subconsciously you you realise that 
Amazement 
this is a ridiculously generalized question that I start off with 
only it gi gives you an opportunity to moan if it 's an impossible sort of question to answer 
as it were 
Yes 
That is a difficult question 
Hmm 
The role of the father in the family I mean or or anything general that you 
Any general thoughts 
Yeah 
Yeah 
should be around 
if he decides to have children 
what actual specific role he should fulfil within the family I 
sort of want to 
Mm 
OK 
Perhaps you could tell me a little bit about your own father 
well yes 
Yes 
an actor 
he 's very uh he 's very nice really 
He 's very charming 
uh well he 's been married several times 
I don't know 
Well 
Well uh bearing in mind I know nothing about him at all I mean 
All right 
He 's very charming 
He 's very nice 
uhm 
He 's been married 
Uh now he 's just going through a divorce again 
uh and uh he always seems to find it rather difficult 
if you see what I mean and see his own responsibility for the marriages not working out or is it anything to do with him 
Uhm he finds that very difficult to cope with 
And he 's not like that when you meet him he 
he is very nice and he 's mellowed a lot over the years I think 
He 's uh uh He 's got a lot more thoughtful 
and uh he 's become more considerate about other people 's feelings 
Uhm 
Mm 
You 're a child of which marriage 
Uh the first marriage 
And there were how many children 
Me and my sister 
You and your sister 
older than your sister 
That 's right 
You were the oldest 
Of eight uhm 
What What age were you when he went in fact 
my being very young 
at all 
about her not being on her own 
particularly strange that I didn't have a father around that I was in a one parent family 
It never seemed odd I think partially because uhm my mother knew quite a few people who were in one parent families 
I think 
I mean I certainly can't can't it does it does I don't remember it being being odd 
we used to see him at Christmas and once or twice a year 
but it was very rare that we saw him when I was when I was uh very young 
uh jet-setting around quite a lot really uh and going off and doing things and travelling around so that he 'd catch up with us 
cash you know 
uh thing 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Can you describe to me if possible a typical day in your home when you were a boy of less than fourteen 
Right 
School day School day 'd be a typical day yes 
Uh we 'd get get get up 
go to school 
depends how far back you take it really 
When I was at primary school uhm I really didn't like going to school and I used to pretend that I 'd be sick 
and so I didn't have to go to school 
I got quite good at like heating up thermometers and stuff and give myself a temperature and things 
Uh once I went to secondary school for some reason or other although I complained about it more I actually didn't mind going in 
So there 's two different patches there if you see what I mean 
There 's my pre-secondary school and and post uhm 
Didn't like going to school 
was leaving my mum really 
I think that was it 
I was I was insecure 
I can remember that I mean it was it was particularly bad at primary school 
I can remember vividly my first day at primary school 
I cried a lot 
if you like they really weren't sure whether they were going to be able to keep me on there because I created such a scene about being left on my own 
Yes well I 'd been going to nursery school before that and I can even remember 
from 
Yeah 
But it was only for an hour or two so I didn't feel quite so bad 
it was so long uh at primary school I really 
I didn't like it 
why I pretended to be ill 
That was to to get to spend an extra day at home 
Mm 
Yeah 
Your life is ordered for you 
Balanced is a difficult one 
Ah I mean I 
Mm 
But it says something that you 're not saying it definitely is or it definitely isn't I mean which suggests that it was balanced in some ways and not in others 
Yes yes 
I suppose 
Yes yes 
Yes 
I know 
uh because I certainly wasn't sad 
If one weren't happy 
Again it 's no good to say like it was always fun 
I mean there 's a kind of feeling that I 'd I 'd get that I might say that yes there was 
It I mean yes there was elements of it that were fun 
Yes 
I mean 
or it wasn't relevant 
Mhm 
Well I 'd say it was I 'd say it was 
Yeah 
Uh it 's not what I 'd pick out 
That 's uh That 's what I was thinking 
and like well it is something that I tend to look back on and and I suppose it is to a certain extent 
Yeah 
Mmm 
a positive experience or a negative experience 
Well a little bit 
It depends what you mean in positive or positive or negative way 
Uhm I 'm not a religious person and my mum isn't really particularly either so in the environment at home there wasn't uh it wasn't uh a strong feature of life and I knew it quite a lot about it 
Uhm so I wouldn't say that I actually looked on religion as a bad thing if you see what I mean 
It 's just that that it is 
Mm 
Mm 
Right 
So you didn't have a lot of religious pressure but nor did you have a lot of religious thought 
They kind of both got in the middle column 
OK 
Well that 's fine 
That That 's fine 
OK 
Yeah 
Yeah 
imagine that you 're aged ten and your mother 's speaking about your father 
Uhm well she 'd have she 'd have tried to be as fair as she could 
it depends what you looked for really 
she was really 
But you could you could tell 
Did she succeed 
No 
No 
She didn't succeed really I mean like 
she didn't overtly 6-7-words I mean like the thought of things that he 'd done and so forth 
But she wouldn't say that no good bastard 
he 'd have never do anything for us or anything 
No 
She wouldn't She wouldn't do that 
No 
She 'd She 'd absolutely try not to 
Uhm given a little bit of an excuse she could be negative about him you see but it would need to be she 'd need to be prompted more or less 
It would need to be definitely something which she 'd not 
She 'd agree with somebody if sh if they said that no good bastard 's done this to me 
She 'd go oh yes yes I know 
I know what he 's like 
You know 
I mean if you imagine that she 's actually speaking about him 
it 's difficult actually 
I can't 
I mean she didn't really talk about him as such 
if uh he 'd done something that had upset one of us 
There was not a lot that my Dad did that I particularly took on board and let it get to me 
What 's the problem 
Right 
Fine 
And uhm I went to print 
and it won't print because it keeps on saying feed paper 
Now the paper looks all right 
Ah 
Right 
I don't think it will be 
What you do first is just to switch it off 
Switch it off and switch it on again 
I 've done that a couple of times 
Have you really 
And it seemed to stay on line for some reason 
OK 
How would we do it if it was paper 
Just that it will be very faint and leave paper out 
Infuriating things aren't they 
I think it would get faint 
I ought to bring the manual down 
Do we go downstairs and get a cassette 
You get another one 
Uh do you know it fits 
It should say 
A cassette isn't it 
Yeah 
I think 
Right 
OK 
Yeah 
to reprocess 
Right 
OK 
and started playing around with it 
and I 
It 's gone on there 
But I I I saved I I said I didn't want it saved 
and I also deleted everything else 
Right 
Right 
Right 
version on there 
I mean I was only got the master one 
I was editing the master 
on my own 
OK 
If you didn't ask for it to be saved then it would still be the master one on there I think 
Yes 
But it 's it it isn't 
It 's changed to my address 
Uh one thing I do find 
when you 're in the middle of a thing you can't get back to this can you 
Well never mind 
and we move to view 
And I haven't checked into that number for that one 
like that 
and it didn't seem to want to work for me you see 
Right 
Right 
View document 
Right 
Go Go back to edit 
OK 
Now 
Well yeah 
Let 's see what there is now 
Edit 
We 've got example one or example one 
Yeah 
It 's still there 
OK 
delete that 
F eight 
Clear it 
It all fits in this section this 
Well does it fit 
Yes 
now if we save that 
What 
You save to clear do you 
Well it sa 
do you want to save it 
Oh I see 
OK 
That 's the original one 
OK 
You still got two called example one and I don't know quite why there are differences there 
Yeah 
Cleared 
Yeah 
Wait oh yes right 
another one so you 're trying with this one 
Let 's view uhm example one 
Now we 've got rid of that there 
Now we got a funny date up there 
Well that was 
Oh yes 
Well I did start putting the date 
then my typing wasn't very good so as you see I was putting the new date in and I obviously hadn't deleted the rest of it 
Right OK 
OK 
Let 's have a look at that date 
it tells you why 
Yeah 
If you just open that top one top one 
Oh right 
Twenty-fourth 
How 're you going to delete that 
You 're going to clear 
or what 
I I don't know what what 
I was just going to leave a date in here 
I mean that 's the 
Well let 's leave it at that twenty-fourth of March nineteen ninety-two 
something for our address and telephone number 
What 
Just to see if it works or something 
Well just so that there is a 
Yes 
Sure 
fits 
That 's all right 
This is another thing I did 
You know you don't think of those things 
do you 
I mean that I didn't 
What 's that 
Well you have down there as well 
Which 
Yeah 
But that locks it into caps 
Yeah 
But that 's that 's 
Oh that 's the same one 
is it 
Oh good 
Yeah 
I know 
Oh I 've forgotten now 
up quick 
Now does it go up that way 
What 's it doing 
What d' you want to change 
I want to change everything 
No 
That 's all right 
leave it at 
Oh I see 
OK 
Now we want to write on it 
No 
Use the capital there 
Oh yes 
Oh I see 
Yes 
Yeah 
That 'll do 
OK 
OK 
Save 
Oh were you you must put a telephone number 
Oh 
Do I Do you put a telephone number in there 
Where does it say 
Address and telephone number 
Oh right 
I haven't noticed it 
Yes 
I think the general problem that people don't read screens 
I don't myself uhm 
Don't you 
Oh right 
You don't read screens 
do you 
No right 
Mm 
No 
No 
i it 's a bad way of communicating with people 
Mm 
I can't remember what telephone numbers are like 
five two three six seven 
Well any one 
And then you would go on to F ten wouldn't you 
No 
Best kept secret 
No 
Well I mean if you wanted that to go on to the next thing could you not just go ahead on to the next thing 
to date 
I think you can 
can't you 
Sorry 
Yes 
if it i uh if you 're going to do that yes I 'm sorry 
Uh I had I thought that was the only change you were going to make in there 
yeah 
Now I think you have to save it first 
Ah yes 
D' you want to save it 
The answer is yes 
We do 
Document already exists 
Do we save that 
Answer yes 
one 
Uhm do I want to type this or not 
No 
OK 
Right 
Right 
Hello 
Can I help you 
Yeah 
if these are to take away 
I mean if there were students 
Yes 
Help yourself 
Is there anything on there I can take or 
Oh what 's that 
Law 
I 'll come back then 
We said yes 
we didn't pull the switch 
Did you not say it was best to say yes uh 
No 
It doesn't actually matter but if you say no it 's all right 
Mm 
Don't think that it will be 
It just worries me 
Oh that 's very lucky 
Yeah 
and then come back then it it 's changed again yeah 
I I don't know how to change the overall beetle 
Shall I print it out now 
Right 
Right 
goes back to that 
or would it 
we can check it 
Well it doesn't matter 
Yeah 
That 's OK 
Oh right 
Yeah 
That 's all right 
That 's OK 
That 's OK that one 
Well you 've got it 
Set to fifty-eight 
uhm as long as 
Right 
These are quite smart aren't they for the schools conference super badge 
I know 
Yes 
Isn't it 
I think I might get us sort of a set for all of us 
Oh that 's rather nice 
isn't it 
Yes 
Yes 
set uhm 
though 
Yes 
I was showing Mike and uh Dinah on Thursday 
F one is it you know the instructions on this account 
It 's quite time-consuming 
isn't it 
It would take a long time 
Right 
Right 
Right 
Yes 
any experience at all 
That 's right 
That 's what we were doing 
Right 
lousy area 
Oh are you 
Are you 
Hi 
Hi 
uhm d' you know what the uhm access funds are looking like this term 
Is it 
What do you mean 
uhm 
ha roughly half the people that have applied got money from it 
a lot of the money seems to have gone a lot of the large sums seem to have gone to postgraduates 
Really 
the letters are being sent out tomorrow 
You should receive notification next week some point telling you whether or whether you haven't got any money from the fund 
H how much is that like the smaller sum 
It ranges from a hundred pounds 
I 'm not sure what the highest amount they 've paid out this term is 
Really 
Well 
Uhm 
Really 
OK right 
Thanks a lot 
Sorry 
What happens with T V licences 
No 
Didn't you pay one 
Uhm 
they caught her without a licence 
and the following day she applied for one 
Did you get 
Uhm 
They came round on the third and I got my licence on the fifth 
But basically they came round 
and I didn't have one at the time 
You know 
the problem with that is they can fine up to twelve hundred pounds 
Yeah 
So I don't I don't get a criminal record then 
I 'm just looking that up 
I 'm not sure whether it 's a criminal offence or not 
It would say if it was a criminal offence 
Is it best that I do attend court 
Yeah I 'd heard something like that 
I heard that 
Do your parents have a licence 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Then it 's quite clear 
isn't it 
Yeah I heard something like that 
more than one people can have own one licence in the law 
Yeah I 've got that as well 
But it is 
three-or-four-words 
Is your television recorder hired or or 
What with buying with buying my T V 
Yeah 
Well I 've got a T V at my parents ' house but my T V three-or-four-words 
We rented it 
all students exempt practically all students exempt from having a television licence 
Uhm 
and the students pay for the television licence 
It 's only when you 've got you know you can get those battery operated televisions 
It 's only if you have one of them and your parents have a licence that you 're covered under that 
parents ' licence 
are you gonna appear in court or are you going to 
Oh right 
Do they 
Well I dunno don't know 
What I would suggest is 
twelfth now 
aren't we 
Right 
we 've got an appointment to go and see the solicitors at the Mary Ward Legal Centre right 
and what I would suggest is that we make you an appointment to go and see one and talk it through 
I 'm not sure what would be the better in your interest whether you 'd be guilty by or you go and you try and prove your case 
but they 'd be able to tell you what your best course of action is 
yeah 
Right it says that the court case isn't until the thirteenth of April 
This is only the twenty-fourth of March 
so it still leaves you a couple of weeks 
Yeah 
No it doesn't say anything about a criminal record in here so 
The thing is even if they fine us all of us are completely overdrawn 
What would what would happen then cos I just can't afford to pay a four hundred pound fine 
Yeah it says 
so they ask you how much money you 're getting how much money you 're paying out 
But I mean it 's still a case of 
It has been known I mean 
said 
I really can't afford to pay this 
and they said 
well 
it doesn't matter 
you 've got to pay it 
guilty by writing as long as 
Uhm 
Yeah 
Yeah 
which is twelve 
so basically you 've got eighty-six pounds a week to live on 
Yeah 
So there 's no argument 
Oh yeah 
I mean 
you know apart from jobs that anybody is going to manage to get through the year a year in private accommodation on that and no grants unless they do not eat 
You can't walk from Golders Green 
OK 
I I mean 
I don't know whether 
what can we do 
Do you think the letter addresses the issues 
yeah yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah I think it does 
Yeah 
It does 
this time certainly 
he can't just send me a bill like that 
OK 
I mean 
Yeah 
And he 's got enough time now to find some more tenants and he 's only got to find some three months after anyway 
Yeah 
It 's stupid 
He 's got as much chance as anyone else 
I know 
I think so too 
OK I 'll send it 
If uh actually what department are you again 
If he answers me I 'll drop you a note 
If you don't hear anything in about two weeks come back 
All right obviously come back before the end of term 
Yeah I will do 
I mean I can't see how it could take him that long 
He 'll get that tomorrow morning 
OK 
Right OK then 
Thanks a lot 
All right 
Let 's hope it works 
Yep 
Thanks a lot 
OK 
Bye now 
Apparently she couldn't be bothered to come upstairs 
Bit cheeky innit isn't it 
I mean d did you mean Derek 
I think he means Derek 
Right 
Was it you just ringing up 
Right 
What is it again 
It 's youth in action 
Right 
I went to the meeting 
find where I 'm supposed to hand it in 
I haven't finished the form yet anyway 
I just wanna want to find out 
Weren't you given an address or anything like that to 
Well there 's an address in here 
He said to hand it in to Karen 
He didn't say anything abou about posting it off to America 
an anyone in campus 
is it 
Campus Travel 
No no 
don't know what it is 
thing 
three-or-four-words 
Is it an academic exchange 
Dunno don't know 
It 's the it 's the whole university 
Not camp who gave you the form 
You 're sure he 's not pulling your leg 
aren't you 
Yeah and I went to this meeting on Friday 
OK 
Wh b wh where was the meeting 
Windeyer Building 
And the idea 
T tell me how the scheme works 
Well 
it 's basically you go over and stay with someone for three weeks 
and then it 's five weeks the whole thing 
and then you do what you want to do so then they come over and stay with you 
Just students in America 
That it 's not academic or 
it 's just like a cultural 
Are you sure you just haven't got to send it off to the the American address 
Well I think maybe I 'll have to 
What would you say 
He just I 'm s sure 
he said something about a woman called Karen 
Not that 
Try the International Office 
on the telephone 
See if they know anything about it 
That 's a pretty good idea actually 
isn't it 
It wasn't Terry 
was it 
Not Terry no 
That 's that 's the general manager 
Yeah that 's what I think 
finding out who booked the room in the Windeyer 
Who booked it 
Not Derek is it 
Was it a booked an advertised session 
Y yeah it was in the staff dining room all day on Friday in the Windeyer 
student get yourself a copy 
Uhm 
I 'm quite happy 
Well he just handed that to me 
Yeah OK 
I didn't uhm I mean I 'm a student elsewhere 
I didn't turn it down 
I just said oh thank you very much yeah 
So 
But you don't I mean it 's a I mean you 're welcome to have a look at this one but I need it back because I 'm gonna go for it myself 
But I think you sh I think you should go over and get yourself one 
I 'll go and get one 
They have there 's hundreds of them 
I couldn't believe it 
Yeah 
I 've seen they got loads of books in there 
OK 
What schools are you interested in 
Uhm Kent University 
But that that would be like a full-time master 's 
A an M B A 
One year full-time 
Get some qualification 
and then what I can do with it afterwards is 
Probably yeah 
Some of the stuff 
Yeah 
Some of the stuff that 's been in the press 
I mean obviously it used to be that it it it used to be Harvard 
but now there 's so many people offering them 
There is definitely and there was a thing in the I think the Sunday Times or the Observer a couple of weeks ago and they 've got articles in the Careers Office about it talking about are they worth whose are worth getting 
Which ones are highly thought of 
Uhm 
Yeah 
uhm Hatfield Middlesex 
Everybody 's doing it 
It 's a growth industry 
Exactly 
degrees sort of like language bias and information technology bias 
and you know you can do all sorts of degrees 
The one at uhm Kent University is particularly useful 
Cos my first degree 's in French and Spanish 
and it has a sort of language you know 
so that would be really good 
It does sound good 
Yeah 
It might and the other thing about it is it 's worth asking at the different schools as well about funding 
But it 's worth it 
It 's worth asking 
A lot of leg work and lots of letter writing 
and you might not get any anything out of it at all 
but I think it 's worth asking 
Oh dear 
Uhm 
in order to be a favourite 
I don't know 
I don't know how quickly they fill up 
That 's the busy time 
isn't it 
I mean there will be 
Yeah 
There 's still time 
You 'll be sitting on the phone at work ringing around 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Where are you working now 
I 'm working in a software house in Kilburn 
They won't uh sponsor you 
and you 've got to stay in the company for two years cos uhm a friend of mine was doing it part-time 
I think doing it part-time is really silly because it 's quite a demanding course 
Yeah uh cos I know a course with someone who 's doing it at the moment 
She 's doing it part-time 
She said it has very much taken up with lots more time than she realised 
Exactly 
The same as my colleague you know 
She 's a lot more tired and she sort of like has to take time off work over it 
You know I think if you really want to do it you do it properly 
you 've got to be able to think to yourself I need a lot of time here 
I think I 'm quite looking forward to doing it full-time anyway 
three-or-four-words 
Yeah well should we go over and uh 
OK 
Well good luck 
Is it I mean once you 've got the st more stuff about it if there 's any anything you wanna want to ask me come back 
I mean s cos you were telling me it 's what what I mean to give you a careers interview they 'd charge you twenty-five pounds but there 's a hell of a lot of information Tony could just get by just standing at the counter you know and saying what do you think 
Ask about the deadlines 
and the newspaper articles are quite good 
I mean I I get the impression people are borrowing lots of money as well to fund them because supposedly at the other end there 's this big pay-off 
Must be a bit of a disaster if there 's not 
Uhm 
Yeah with a sort of 
get a tape recorder 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Yeah I 've heard about that 
debts people have 
Uhm 
Exactly 
Yeah 
I mean really if you were talking of figures like seventy thousand pounds a year and things like that 
How true that is 
Uhm 
Depends what you want to do with it as well 
Uhm 
Yeah 
I guess 
Seventy grand a year 
Well you should do one Tony 
Pay off my grant 
My masses of grant from Haringey Council 
Exactly yeah 
Did you finally get all your cheques by the way 
Yeah I did 
Yeah 
I got them all 
I got them all through in the end 
And so you 're not going to have a problem for next term are you cos they had all those details 
No 
uhm I 've still got to tackle that 
That 's a little challenge 
isn't it 
It 's meant to keep everybody in work 
I mean let 's ha in if there isn't such people like Haringey there wouldn't be people like me so it 's a a bit of a plus 
The more incompetent these people are the more we like it 
Yeah right 
Yeah 
Yeah you 'd be out of a job so 
Anyway 
OK well 
Thanks very much then 
Are you s 
My pleasure 
I hope you find out what you need the information you want 
Did you sort out about your glasses 
Yeah actually I 've got a form some forms here 
I 'm definitely not going to put down a lie 
how I 'm not too sure how much they 're going to check up the sort of figures on what you 're getting in your grant and stuff like that 
They just assume everything 's full 
It 's an outrage 
isn't it 
That is ridiculous yeah 
and they probably used to come and say we don't get any money from our parents 
and they 'd say well I know that 
but they just assume you do 
Uhm 
Exactly 
Uhm 
Yes I I think that 's just totally 
How how they do class the loans and incomes is 
like it 's a farce really 
I would I wouldn't m if they want it to be an income fine 
Yeah 
I d I can't believe them 
I know 
Exactly 
Give it as a grant 
Yeah 
Exactly 
There 's like there 's you can't they can't get the best of both worlds 
it 's total hypocrisy 
isn't it 
It is yeah 
It really really is 
It 's a farce 
Uh I 've got a spare one for you 
I don't know if you 're going to use it 
and then for some reason we like begged and pleaded and wrote and they stopped sending them 
I don't know why it was 
I used to have a great big pile 
Uhm 
When I 've finished with these I 'll bring these to you as well right but I 've I need these ones three-or-four-words 
Sure 
I 've got a whole pile of those actually over there 
I mean cos they let us have these those but these we can't get any more 
I used to give them out on you know all the time 
Oh you have 
Oh right 
Uhm 
but I can get 
It 's a terrible form as well 
isn't it 
Don't you think 
I have I haven't actually read through it all 
I can get some more 
I can go and grab a load more if you want 
Oh it 's a real 
Can you just pick them up 
Yeah 
Just go round to the s Social Security 
I I I I I said look cos they they haven't got a clue what their prices are 
uh so 
Six for my Mum 
Yeah 
when you 're around there again I 'll uh 
Yeah it is quite impressive 
isn't it 
An impressive bit of paper 
That 's pretty impressive 
I just 
We could we should just send everybody 
Would they accept photocopies of it 
No 
I don't think so 
I mean it 's a government form 
isn't it 
Exactly 
And they won't give it to you 
In in other words they 're trying to st they 're trying to make it more difficult to get hold of it 
Yeah well what happened was we used to have them 
and Sam wrote and they just never ever 
They just send that back 
Out of stock and they 've never 
One year we had them all the time 
Last year we didn't have any 
It 's like Social Security work for the government 
Really 
Uhm 
But you can't just pick them up off the counter can you 
Yeah you can 
But you have to request them don't you cos they they they interview didn't they 
Someone could just walk out with it 
Do you have to request it 
Cos I could just go in there and pick up twenty

Holidays of you looking happy 
tanned men s basking in the background 
No not all of them 
On white beaches with blue sea 
No tanned men in them 
You don't have to look at all of them 
Not 
So there 's no gor 
Right 
Sure 
They 're not going to be mega-ly depressed 
No 
No no no no no 
Well I still want to know what your Plan B is 
It 's the wettest November they 've had for twenty-five years 
I want to know what your Plan B is 
Then I 'll look at your holiday snaps 
So what do you think of my plan then 
What 
to go and meet people 
Well 
Do you think I should do it 
Why 
Cos I 've got one 
Well I do 
Well yes 
I don't know that we uhm should go and do it at the wh 
where did you suggest 
Well I definitely found I pre I prefer creative people to academics 
Well where would you want to go 
or an estate agent 
That would be ideal 
I don't know 
Nowhere where people wear frilly bow ties though 
Sorry 
Well no 
No I don't know 
Well I definitely 
You 've got some lovely habits 
I definitely like Americans 
Hah 
Yeah I know 
I know 
I 've also got very clean ears 
OK I pick my ears but they 're very clean 
Some people have ears you know because I clean them 
Some people Some people have ears full of wax because they never do this 
I mean which is better 
to do this and clean clean the wax out of your ears or to go round with wax in your ears 
You shouldn't have put it in your mouth afterwards 
I think that 's one of those things you do in private like picking your nose 
Is it 
What 
You can't do this 
Well 
Only in front of your closest friends 
Oh 
I suppose so 
feel free to pick your bits 
I don't mind 
Pick your ears 
Well I 'd rather a friend picked their ear personally although I don't think I 've ever seen anyone else apart from me do it come to think of it 
Yes I 've got some disgusting habits 
Well I 'd rather that than when you look round at a close friend of yours and you see a great globule of wax in their ear 
I mean that 's really disgusting 
How could people be so insensitive as to not know they 've got wax in their ears 
You 'd say I 'm sorry but I have to tell you you 've got a big globule of wax in your ear 
you 've got a globule of 
yes but I 'd be but I 'd be I 'd be surprised if someone didn't didn't wasn't aware of it 
There 's nothing There 's nothing dreadful about sticking your finger in your ear surely 
No no no no no 
There isn't 
Shut up 
Oh well I 'm sure the thing the thing about nose-picking is that nobody ever admits to doing it 
I have done it but just not not when there 's been anybody else around 
Well no but that 's the joke about traffic jams 
Where 's best 
Because you feel as if you 're on your own presumably because you 're sitting in a car on your own 
but actually there 's lots of people looking through the window 
You do 
Uhm I have seen people do it before 
That was very funny 
Some people just don't care where they do it 
But we weren't going to talk about sex 
were we 
So what would you like for your next man then if you could if you could design him 
Well I 'd actually like the same one back again actually 
If it 's not too much trouble 
Oh Jenny 
But it would be too much trouble 
It 's going to go on 
You don't want a man with two kids and a wife 
Come on 
No 
Everybody else manages to divorce their wives 
I don't see why he can't 
I don't see what the problem is 
Everybody else in the world does it 
Well he 's got two kids for one thing 
That 's one of the problems 
Yes but he doesn't like his wife 
No well maybe he likes his kids Jenny 
Well it doesn't mean he has to live with them 
It 's much better to not have them screaming at each other 
when they 're screaming at each other 
Well I don't know 
I still wouldn't wish a married man with two kids on anyone 
You know the thing that struck one of the things that struck me about this 
left his wife for her 
Right so someone similar in your position 
Uh uhm 
and this was about five years ago 
The wife was about again a big age gap 
Uh uhm 
The first wife there 's 
there 's a big age gap 
No no 
and the woman had brought up two kids with this guy and you know lived all her life with him 
and basically he pissed off to go out with this young girl 
The wife nearly went crazy at being left on her own at I don't know forty or whatever she is 
and this this girlfriend of mine when describing a woman I knew exactly who she was describing described someone as unforgiving described this this this woman the wife as unforgiving 
I thought bloody hell unforgiving 
I mean I mean I 've got a foot you know I 've got a foot in both camps 
I 'm quite unusual in that situat in that from that position because I 've not only A I 've been in love with a married man but also I 've had I 've had my husband leave me for a younger woman 
Right 
Uhm 
Uhm 
I wouldn't want him to leave her for me but when I met him she 'd already left him and 
Yes but obviously by the fact that she wanted him back as I said to you she obviously wasn't leaving him 
which he wasn't looking at 
He was choosing to go off and you know not look at it 
So she thought well I I 'll threaten to leave the bastard 
I 'll leave the bastard 
and then he 'll realise that there 's something wrong 
and then he 'll do something about it 
and what does he do about it 
He goes and meets you 
That 's obviously not the reaction well judging from the way she behaved when he you know 
I mean if she 'd really wanted to leave him she 'd have she 'd have sent you flowers 
She 'd have sent you flowers with a little note that said good luck on 
wouldn't she 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Anyway just just OK well just for the sake of the exercise should you not have him and should you w want to design yourself a new one 
what uh 
Huh 
What particular model would you like 
Someone specific 
No no 
You want the older man now 
do you 
Something over thirty 
Yes 
Definitely 
Absolutely definitely 
How How old are we going for here 
Over thirty over thirty-five 
Over thirty 
Thirty five would be just nice 
Just thirty-five would be perfect 
A mature thirty would even do 
Between thirty and thirty-five 
He 'd have a body like Nick rounders bat Nick 
Half-caste guy 
I remember you describing the rounders bat 
Mixed race person should I say 
A mixed race person 
Mary Jane tells me I shouldn't use the word half-caste 
Don't know why he 's a half-caste 
I don't understand the problem 
But anyway 
Anyway one that 's a nice coffee colour 
Because half-caste suggests half 
not quite right 
I think person of mixed 
I actually agree with Mary Jane 
Well whatever 
But was it the colour or the or the build 
Both 
Absolutely both 
He looked 
he 
I mean that this is the thing when I ask you to describe the build and you mentioned the rounders bat 
I mean I meant of the entire body rather than just of the rounders bat 
No I was just saying who d who who did you mean 
You know 
No 
Actually he w he he looked like a polished 
And what kind of body would you like 
Well about nine inches 
No no no no no 
I was just saying that checking who you meant 
You know he looked like a polished conker 
He was really He was shiny and absolutely smooth 
Not a hair 
Uhm 
Yes that body 
Not a hair 
You don't like hairs 
Not on his chest no 
Oh he had the best skin 
No 
But do you not like hairs in general 
Oh isn't that interesting 
I do 
No I don't 
No but he had the biggest muscles and the smoothest skin in the world 
So yes 
Body 
Nick body 
Absolutely definitely 
Without a doubt 
Nick 
And Billy 's money 
Yes I was just about to say 
Billy 's racehorses Billy 's bank balance 
Billy don't be a hero 
Yes 
Not Billy 's bald head 
God I 'm frozen 
I must go and get a cardigan 
And uhm 
Are you cold 
Well I 'm a bit chilly 
Whose mind 
I 'm bloody frozen 
Whose mind 
Whose mind 
Murray 's 
Murray 's mind 
Yeah 
Ah 
Yes 
Oh Murray 's so sweet 
yeah he rang me up when uh Julie was away and we had a chat 
Oh he was so funny 
He said I mean you know all the emotional problems that Julie 's had I mean and is still having 
Up in the middle of the night 
hallucinations you know 
nightmares 
screaming 
Is she still having hallucinations 
Basically the works yes 
She 's still She 's still got big problems 
Anyway the joke is Murray got a cold 
After three years of this Murray got a cold and and went to bed for two hours because he was feeling awful 
and Julie was going around saying you bloody men you hypochondriacs and they the least thing and you 're b taking to your bed and blah blah blah 
and Julie said Murray said it was just great 
After two years you know of of being woken up at all hours of the night 
Nurt Waiting on her nursing her you know 
I have a cold and go to bed and I 'm accused of being bloody men you know 
The least thing 
Oh poor lamb 
So I said to come down here Murray and I 'll stroke your back 
Given half a chance 
Oh bless him 
No we don't we don't do groups there 
We do groups at uhm Kettering 
We do but we do very small versions 
Oh yes I mean it is nice there 
well the actual setting 's nice but what 's ghastly about it is it 's run by fogeys 
I just got 
I just can't stand to confront them recently for no particular reason 
but there is such a ghastly atmosphere when there 's 
oh 
And everyone walks in you know 
it 's that sort of atmosphere 
and it 's really intense antagonism 
same generation and same attitude and 
and 
But apart from that it 's lovely 
I mean on a day like this it 's magnificent and there 're some really nice people there 
Where 's the sh whesh 
Splendid 
yeah we did 
whereas Northway is always up against everyone a bit 
That 's the only disadvantage 
It 's slightly closed the closed the courts are closed in on each other 
I think they are in every tennis club 
I mean 
There is in fact this lady 
I mean 
to cope with unless you get them and syphon them off into areas 
and you don't because this lady actually a marvellous woman called Pepys Elizabeth Pepys 
she used to actually have lessons at Northway 
Uhm 
Pepys 
specialises in allergies or something 
and her husband 's a very very bright professor 
all of them and the son and the daughter who are very who are orthodox orthodox the kids 
but the parents aren't 
And she she 's organised 
she 's rung around 
sorry 
You 'll never get a word in with me talking 
You were 
Well you were asking me what I was doing today 
Yeah what were you doing today 
I was in Narrow Wood which is just near Box Hill Dorking 
Yeah yeah uh I 've been to Box Hill 
This place called Narrow Wood which is an educa 
Narrow Wood 
Yeah 
Yeah 
but it was an open day today 
so there were lots of kids streaming in and out 
Yeah 
It 's for that uh uh uh 
In what group was that the 
Kingston Conservation Volunteers 
Oh yeah yeah so 
So yeah we 're going back there 
That 's not strictly con conservation 
is it 
It 's it 's to do with recreation recreation more than 
Not really 
Well we 're more used to planting trees and chopping them down and hu hurdling 
Yeah 
so 
Yeah 
Temporary one 
Well it 's one they can plant themselves onto fishnets 
Yes 
It 's when you 
It 's you know it 's a nature reserve 
you know it 's yes 
Walks 
yeah yeah 
Yeah 
Have you been there before 
you 're 
you 're familiar with that particular 
yes 
about three times before 
Yeah 
How many what 
Oh commons yeah yeah 
Yes 
I work all around sort of Surrey Leatherhead area 
That 's a nice area isn't it Leatherhead 
Park 
we do all different kinds of ones this winter 
Mmm 
up to Dorking 
From Leatherhead up to Dorking that area 
you know when we 're needed you know 
she organises the task 
and says you know 
Yeah 
So you got involved through her 
did you 
No I she got involved through me 
My ex-boyfriend Phil he got me interested 
one 
It was December the thirty-first nineteen eighty-nine and I really enjoyed it and then Alice came out on my second task and she 's loved it 
What happened before that 
Very 
Keeps you fit though 
No I mean Phil 
Phil fell over on wild ponds and dipping ponds 
yeah 
We we are good friends but he 's having a few problems with his girlfriend new girlfriend 
I 'm going to try and contact him tomorrow at work see how he is 
oh I see 
type of thing or 
And I wouldn't have him back 
she sort of came in couple of months later 
Oh 
Have you met her 
Did she 
In Muswell Hill 
uhm and she lives up in North London 
Yeah 
Yeah 
pum the pumping station 
It 's horrible and filthy and horr 
I didn't like it at all 
she started talking to Phil 
But she 's really nice though 
With Phil 
no not with Phil 
well libido 
No 
Libido 
I was doing 
It was the week before last 
You 're not working 
I am working 
But you just took the time off 
Yeah 
So this is your job 
Uh yeah 
You were on holiday 
I do 
I do go on working holidays 
Yeah 
see a bit of English countryside and do what I do 
Yeah well it 's very good because it 's very difficult to meet people in London 
isn't it 
I mean 
whereas if you actually take up a some kind of activity where you 're sharing something with someone then you tend to talk more naturally and you get to know people better 
Mmm 
So you can't follow and pursue it yeah 
Yeah 
But you don't actually have a rapport with people at work 
do you necessarily 
No 
Yeah 
Play separately 
Uhm 
Mind you hopefully they 'll be coming to my birthday party 
but I did ask a few people I did ask a few people at work to my birthday party so 
When is that 
Second of May 
with Alice 
We 're having a joint birthday party 
Is her birthday round the same time 
Sixth 
spread out a bit more 
Yeah and it won't be so 
but it turned out to be too expensive or fully booked up 
and we were having so many problems trying to get through to people 
and it 's just 
friend Clare said 
yeah 
sure 
she 's got a big house so we 're taking it over kind of thing 
Kew Bridge is it 
Yeah 
D' you know the Mortlake Road 
Yeah 
She lives on there 
Ah 
Are you are you going you getting out there 
Ch Christmas time 
Anyway 
Are you insisting on this 
Well we 're going to have a fa family do actually on the day 
What are you what are you going to do 
Uh 
with all the fa with your family and a few friends yeah 
Yeah 
No 
not just family because I 'll be seeing all the friends on apart from one on 
yeah 
Family 
On at the party 
How many do you think will come turn up 
Well I don't know 
One 's going to Paris 
another 's travelling for a month 
He goes on Thursday 
so 
And one person 's allergic to my friend 's dog 
She 's he 's allergic to dogs or cats you know 
the dust and 
you know 
shame really 
Yeah 
I mean she 's going to have the time of her life 
Why do not you 
Yes it is going to be sixties gear 
Oh dear 
Cos Alice and I were both born in sixty-two so 
Well sixties is popular I mean if people can find out find anything 
Oh yeah 
We went to a sixties party two years ago I think it was for a friend of ours and it was a great success 
I mean I have still got well 
Do you get a tape of all the music and stuff 
Yeah I have got lots of people bringing tapes 
tapes 
and I am doing some 
and Sue and Gerry 
What sort of food do you get 
Do you get try and get anything typical 
No we are 
There must have been something that was 
Hamburger time 
or I dunno don't know 
or no 
that was later 
Oh I see so 
Yes yes 
Yes 
Oh 
Oh yeah 
Meat 
Oh oh yes yes 
Yes 
But there is a lot of meat still basically 
A lot of meat 
Well we will have dips and crisps and things like that but we are also having 
Clare makes a mean chilli so we will have that 
I am also probably going to do a vegetarian dish 
Uhm 
Alice is on a has got a few ideas 
we will go to a cash and carry place and get try and get a lot of the ingredients cos my friend Karen her father has got a cash and carry card 
so if we do that we will get wine and beer cheap 
Much cheaper is it 
Probably if you buy in bulk 
Yeah 
things like beer and 
When we go to a cash and carry there is they have got small 
uhm 
Things like crisps and things like that 
So shall I tell you about this conversation 
I wrote it down sort of uh after I 'd had the conversation obviously 
And I teach there on a 
What 's an O D P school 
Well they 're operating department practitioners and they 're people who uhm work within the operating theatres of hospitals 
So the students come in from all over 
But I do I suppose you 'd call it freelance teaching there 
So I 'm not a full-time lecturer there and I just go in to teach the science 
So therefore when I speak to him it 's partly social contact 
I always try to analyse this 
and it 's partly I realised when I thought about it so that I can gain a certain amount of information from him about what 's happening with the course what 's happening about other lecturers 
You know 
How things are being organised about future developments because communication really is dreadful within the hospital 
I just don't find out anything until it 's happened or all signed and sealed 
And they sort of said 
Oh didn't you know 
Yes 
You may be left out of it because you are a freelancer 
So you have make a social effort when you come around 
So that sort 
That 's right because you know I mean it would be easy to go in and lecture and come out again 
Uhm I said that yes we never have any staff meetings 
Yeah 
He gets feedback also from the students as to what the lecturer 's done and I think this is how he checks on his lecturers 
and also to tune into problems and the general mood and pick up on any moans and groans which otherwise sort of rumble under the surface 
you know because I found this works best 
If I sort of say oh I assume you realise that so and so and so and so and he said oh yes 
So I start off this conversation after we sort of had a bit of social niceties you know like How 's the wife you know How 're things going 
and then I say well next week is a full week 's block teaching isn't it Paul 
That means I teach every day next week 
and he says yes yes that 's right 
You 're in every day 
So I also say to him I assume that you 've reorganised one of my lectures for Tuesday because I assume you realise that at the moment on the timetable I 'm supposed to lecture to two groups of people at exactly the same time 
And he says oh really and uh he obviously hadn't realised 
So he puts this right and I sort of stand by while he sort of uhm reorganises another lecturer to sort of that we can swap over 
So obviously this chap was vital you know 
Uhm well then I suppose having done this now it 's his chance to have a moan 
So he can sort of have a good old moan about anything he feels like 
and the fact that the college haven't yet billed him for my services and if they don't do it before April they won't get the money anyway 
So this is nothing to do with me anyway 
So uhm I keep on the right side of him basically by sort of agreeing with all this and saying how disgusting it all is 
But this isn't definite 
because he says well if they 're willing to give away that much he 's not going to wait for them to change their minds 
So he spent it 
wasted money and hospital waiting lists and things 
and uh but I don't say anything because I 'm a real worm and I 'm sort of saying 
I don't blame you Paul 
Why not something or 
You know socially slushy 
but most of my conversations with him seem to follow that sort of route which is why I chose it 
But as a piece of communication it was very successful 
Yes I thought so 
Because without without that conversation having taken place as you said there would 've been two classes sitting waiting for you 
So there 'd there 've been some some areas in the time table thing that had to be brought to his attention 
Yes 
They both start uhm similar to mine 
Mine had a corporate build-up 
It 's material outcomes you 're going in to to get 
Yes 
You know and 
that terminology 
you have a an objective you know 
So what was yours 
Mine 
Mine 
They normally have this class adult education class where I work 
they weren't used to 
Uhm and uhm communication with two people 
One was the tutor of the class uhm who I don't know very well I maybe met a couple of times before but we haven't got a relationship uhm to speak of and 
but she has a reputation for being difficult 
the sort of person for whom if you said I 'm afraid that there 's no you know we 're running out of tea bags or something you know something 's always going to hitch 
So actually transporting them to another building could be perceived to be a problem 
Uhm 
So you 've got twenty odd pension pensioners 
I mean she 's representative and uh and the course has twenty odd pensioners 
this woman 
for some reason 
I don't know why she isn't doing 
I haven't quite worked that out 
status 
which comes from old acting exercises where you can adopt personal status between one and ten 
One is low status and ten is high status 
and you go onto the scene and then someone else comes in one to ten and the dramatic dynamic is when you meet 
simple as social status or 
It 's a psychological thing 
You can be very high status 
You know silence is very often high status 
their psychological power in the context of the scene 
Uhm so down one one side of the matrix is the different relationships me and Vi the tutor me and Sheila my colleague and Sheila and Vi 
and then the other the other bits are three incidents 
through that episode 
OK 
And I had a bit of a status advantage over Vi because I 'd cleared all the tables and all that and I 'd gotten up 
Cos I 'd I 'd seen that there 'd be problems 
and I 'd actually gone ahead to the hall and it wasn't ready and I got it ready 
So 
So 
And I started off 
Mm 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Oh 
Brilliant 
Right 
Mm 
Right 
Right 
Right 
Yeah 
Mhm 
Yeah 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Mm 
Yes 
Yeah 
started off 
When I say I started off 
Oh she started off slightly ahead of me because there were still a few tables I hadn't cleared away yet uhm uh and so she caught me unawares 
Uhm so that worked through 
and I 'm not mechanically-minded 
I 'm going like this 
Screwdrivers 
Right 
Have I put that 
I think I might have got these the wrong way round that I got high status and she got lower status 
Oh no by the end of that episode I 'd I 'd achieved it and charmed her 
sixth of March 
What 's today 
Yeah 
Today is the tenth 
and the second set which she didn't want to play I won three two 
Didn't want to play a second set 
and then there 's the second set we didn't complete because she didn't want to 
three one 
Three one yeah 
we had one set and I beat her six one 
Yeah 
Yeah 
You turned it round then didn't you 
one not three two 
Mmm 
and uh I 'm doing all that 
and I still uh 
Yeah I know 
for the juniors and I 've got uhm work before team practice and I 'm trying to sort out the work after the team practice 
so I 'm going to be really busy 
How many have you got tomorrow 
I 've got four tomorrow now unless somebody rings up and uh wants a lesson 
Mmm 
I 'll just write down the score 
Her turn is the following week 
Will she be two in a row then 
she said she was coming tomorrow to tell me whether or not she could do the following week 
but she insists that she 's going to come 
I said I 'll be busy teaching 
I won't be able to talk to you 
D' you know I 'll just come when I 'll tell you so she 's doing her bit with uh 
Yeah I 'm sure of that 
But I could make the time 
Carlos 
What time does she normally have a lesson 
Three 
Three o'clock 
Well you can do it and then uh Ursula can forfeit anyway 
Well yes she says it 's her night and I intend to keep her to it because this is her second cancellation 
She cancelled before and went off 
Mmm 
Not good enough is it 
you can't earn a living if they 're going to keep cancelling 
I mean they 've got to uh 
You can't hold hours over for people who are going to mess about 
Well 
Well they won't learn anything if they mess about will they 
well of course 
You can't do that 
I mean you aren't going to honestly give any priority to them 
fit them in when you 've got a space 
Mmm 
When the sun shines off they go 
Yeah 
Well they 
Ursula but I can't keep putting the lessons forward because I 'm not 
It 's just the same 
Yeah but I mean it 's 
No you can't 
when you could have done it when you saw her 
so she 's costing you you know all the time money cos you have to make all the phone calls to do it 
Yes 
Yeah 
Don't know if I want to teach you know tomorrow 
Mind you I wouldn't mind a day 
It is though Saturday so it doesn't really matter 
but you were talking about tomorrow 
Yeah 
Easter Saturday 
motorbikes 
they seem to go very low don't they when they turn the corner 
Mmm 
this other girl that 's the opera singer 
Janice the Wednesday evening one 
Has she booked in anywhere yet 
Has she booked in yet 
I think she 'd rather just sing and not bother to move at all 
but the role calls for her to do some moving 
so she 's uh come a bit unstuck with that part 
So uh I said to her don't leave it until the two weeks before the performance 
I think it 's the money 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Well 
Very expensive this studio 
yeah 
and that 's the cheapest one yeah 
and depending on what time of the day 
season sort of thing they 'll charge her fifteen for that room 
Quite a lot of money for an hour 's lesson 
That 's my fee 
And that 's cheap 
Mmm 
No 
And it 's a bank holiday 
that week and I can do Monday to Friday 
No 
Well this is it 
They had 
Back on the Wednesday 
club team matches 
Some are away and some are home matches 
The away ones are are so different 
in June and June is going to be the busy time for coaching 
July 
and well as soon as you hit July the children start to go away again 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Yeah well they all start going on holiday don't they 
on the Saturday 
but uhm last year I think I had quite a lot you know 
I 'm full up now until June 
I 'm looking at June for bookings 
Well I don't have to look 
really 
Mmm 
Mmm 
Yeah 
Mmm 
Yes well and I expect they 'd say yes too 
They 'd say yes 
they 'll come from ten to eleven wouldn't they 
Yeah 
the little hall over the church would let me teach at midnight 
Mmm 
for coaching 
Continuous expense isn't it 
Can't you go fishing in the lake 
No mmm 
I don't know uh I 
Uh I don't know where the balls go 
Other people must have picked them up then and put them in their ball hops 
I 've just paid off the two dozen 
I only owe for a dozen now 
I 'm going to buy another two so I 'll be owing for three dozen and back to square one again 
straight 
and Robin and get them down here 
Get them going yeah 
Booked in 
I don't really want to do that 
I 'll miss out that ten o'clock 
Mmm 
Mmm 
Uhm 
Mmm why not 
I doubt whether she would 
Do you speak with her in French 
No I speak to her in English 
All that conversation for nothing 
Mercedes 
Well it 's her lunch 
doesn't like missing her lunch 
Mmm 
They 're Labour 
Labour lost 
Commiserations 
Oh that 's right 
a means of exchanging information 
Well it was that as well but I mean there was no T V 
there was no no book 
Would you 
Weren't as many 
Yeah 
Like Oscar Wilde 
Wasn't he famous for being a an amazing conversationalist 
Right 
And now they have a they have like those competitions 
don't they 
conversationalists 
And they 're always on like s uh Six O'Clock Live and things 
sort of thing yeah 
That sort of thing yeah 
Uh that 's probably why it was I suppose 
But I mean I I don't know 
I talk a lot 
Uhm 
I mean with telephones we do talk more 
I mean we should be doing 
Telephones are really weird 
Cos I 've listened to a just a couple of them that we 've done 
and it 's very really really short and there 's loads of little sentences 
and you get lots of uhms and yeahs 
You get that a lot in conversation anyway but 
Suppose so 
your face and body language and 
Right 
Yeah cos I 'm listening to you know you know we 're listening to each other cos we 're looking and stuff but on the telephone you can't see them 
have you been cut off sort of thing you know I suppose uhm 
But they 're quite good cos you can always tell the difference between them cos one person 's voice you know 
films 
and yet they don't 
I don't mean to sound patronising but it 's I mean that 's what I do 
As soon as I 'm out of 
What do you mean 
Yeah 
No no but uh 
which is terrible and I get really guilty about it but I don't want to 
And you get out of the habit of reading as well 
Yeah it 's ridicul ridiculous 
Everything 's so strange because the whole course is the English course is supposed to teach you how to be more articulate 
And 
And be able to read things 
And be able to see the right things in the things you 're reading yeah 
Still you 're still reading but you 're seeing more 
Yeah that 's the 
yeah I wasn't the most model student like I was saying earlier on 
I wasn't exactly the most model student here anyway so 
I 've always read but I 've always been a sort of an addicted reader 
I can read books 
I can read sort of four books in a day if I want to 
I could be that intense about it which was not the right word to use 
the vocabulary that I know I must know and do know is back there somewhere 
I just don't use any of it 
It doesn't come forth as it were 
Uhm 
the person you 're talking to uses as well 
You kind of you find a common 
Uh you do though don't don't you think 
I don't know 
That 's true 
You cha I think you change the way you speak 
I mean he doesn't mean to do it and he 's not being patronising 
He goes y starts saying yeah yeah right oh right I see whereas my dad wouldn't talk like that 
That 's mimetic behaviour isn't it 
if you converse on the same level n neither one 's going to feel out of place or strange or going to feel more at home and therefore be able to communicate better 
I don't know 
What 's that 
Oh mimetic 
Yeah 
Uhm 
Uhm 
more extensive vocabulary 
I 'm therefore put into a position to try and bring out some new words and to express myself well and start speaking you know be to the point and 
Yeah 
I always used to like 
I just love doing things like them 
I could hear them talking and I was sort of vaguely in the conversation 
I hadn't said anything 
They were saying about oh wow oh I just thought 
I hated it because like it brought art down to the common level 
Where 
Here 
Here 
I had a good one on Monday night 
There 's a subject 
When you 're drunk it 's not 
And that was that was deep you know 
Uhm 
Certainly wasn't 
Religion is about the only controversial seb subject we have left today 
definitely about 
Yeah 
It 's not controversial when I talk about it 
if you disagree you disagree you know 
I believe in God 
I don't 
OK 
Yeah but 
But there 's a lot of people you get who who won't accept that aren't willing to argue 
Oh yeah 
They knock on your door on Saturday mornings and get you out of bed and say do you want to buy our pamphlet yeah 
whose parents are Catholic 
Now he 's not a practising Catholic as far as I know and he never talks about it but if it the subject comes up and especially if he 's had a couple of drinks he gets absolutely irate about it 
yeah 
I know I know couple of people like that 
Very offended 
You 'd think he 
Criticise the Church at all I mean the Catholic Church that is 
Yeah 
It 's in sort of inbred defence sort of 
Mm mmm or 
Cos a lot of people get very arrogant about their own religions 
You know this must be 
This is right 
but it 's 
Yeah 
If you believe you can yeah 
No one can know 
I always 
No of course not 
whether people are better off with faith or without or well with faith 
I don't think so but I just wonder you know if they 're happier 
They 'd have to be 
It really depends on the personality because it 
They need something to believe in 
I mean i if you have inner strength to cope with n and the way you cope is base basically you 're coping with your external pressures 
It 's like a security blanket you know 
but then we can't know 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Well that 's the way I see it 
Yeah 
There 's a lovely thought 
She 's doing theology at Oxford and 
she 's an atheist 
which is 
Does it work like that 
I don't think so 
One way of doing it 
That 's what her family was trying to say 
they really don't think that 's going to work like that and she said no no it 's going to be great you know 
I 'll go through life not believing in God and then on the death bed I can say now I was only joking 
I really do love you God 
Ah God knows these things 
Yeah 
And the priest will come bless me and then I 'll be fine 
Yeah 
We had a priest like that kind of 
I was a Catholic 
brought up a Catholic 
And uh you know like in James in Portrait of the Artist yeah 
We had one a bit like that 
He he he was made head of punishments 
That was his his title 
Mmm 
That would look great on your C V 
Yeah head of punishments 
behave well to the people around you treat them with respect and dignity and caring and kindness 
You get so many violent characters 
Or a priest 
Yeah 
Well for some people it is 
It doesn't seem quite correct 
Well nearly all so much religion works on fear 
It does 
It 's compulsion 
Yeah 
Read the Book of Revelations 
Sit down 
Have you read all the Roman plays yet 
Yeah 
them all 
No Shakespeare 
He really does 
He just really scared me about my my moderns two essay as well 
Why 
Because uhm I told him 
he said to me like when I told him I was going to do it 
And I said well I really want to get it finished by Christmas 
and uhm 
Mm mmm 
And uhm so I 'm meant to be finished by Christmas 
Came to January 
and uhm then it was like he goes right well have you finished it 
No 
Have you written the first draft 
Do you know I thought 
I don't know 
Almost thought it was such a 
Just don't know where to stop so 
No 
Is th is that what they expect you 've done a first draft by now 
He think he thinks like I should have finished it by now 
First draft of what 
Moderns two essay 
Did you ever do a course essay 
When 's it due in 
May 
First of May which is actually 
First 
The first 
It 's it 's the second Monday that we get back from Easter holiday 
Well I wasn't an awful teenager 
I 'm sorry I was a nice teenager 
What 
saying gays are disgusting and they should all be executed 
All these thoughts come out 
You were being hilarious 
What was it R Ri 
Richard was saying because you were going can't get a girlfriend I can't get a girlfriend 
I 'll probably end up like that guy at Embankment sta tube station 
You were going oh no oh 
You know tight skin jeans that went choo choo don't you think 
Why why 
A matter of opinion 
I don't remember anything of you 're talking about 
You don't remember it 
You were talking about this guy at Embankment tube station who stood there in in skintight jeans 
he was apparently he was really extremely gay 
I haven't the faintest idea what you 're talking about 
disgusted by the very idea of any sort of perversion in that way 
And then oh that 's right 
And then there 's the really sweet conversation where you go do you know Jacqueline 
Cor she smells I mean like really nice 
And there 's this one particular smell 
well what is it 
Don't know but there 's this one particular smell 
but there 's this one particular smell where she 
It 's really really nice 
And he 's going well what is it 
Dunno don't know but it 's really nice this one particular smell 
And it 's like this smell that 's like really great 
Who was saying that 
Who was saying that 
and Richard was saying how he was going to turn out like the guy on Embankment tube station 
All teenagers are awful at some point 
All all people are awful at some point 
All adults all old age pensioners all children everybody 
All animals are awful at some point 
So you were saying things like that 
it 's like 
three-or-four-words 
Don't you have remember ever 
Kate are you listening 
Trying to blame the problems of the world on teenagers 
I 'm not 
I 'm just saying that 
they 're the ones that try and change them 
Hey you know 
for the destitution and famine and any any problems that we have now 
I 'm just saying that 
Don't be ridiculous 
You would do if you were given the opportunity 
But it 's true 
But don't you remember your parents saying to you something like you know when are you going to do your homework and you saying oh for God 's sake and stomping up the stairs and thinking you 're the hardest done-by person in the world 
Oh 
The way you 
You were obviously an exception and you never 
You were a perfect child and perfect teenager perfect adult 
What are you doing 
I see 
How many are 
What 
Where are we going to play 
That 's not true 
I 'm going to write wash me on everything 
Set me free from the mountains of dust 
No I don't think so 
It works doesn't it 
Right look 
there 's nothing wrong with a bit of dust 
so she 's finally turned green 
you 'll be very pleased to hear after talking about lead 
What 's it called 
Well that 's not the right way to go about it 
Don't know how I 'm going to get one 
Why don't you buy a rickshaw 
A what 
John can run around 
Now I can show my ignorance 
What 's a rickshaw 
I thought it was a form of haystack 
At least that 's what it sounds like 
Oh with a bicycle bit 
Oh right 
He pull he pulls them 
holds two poles and you sit in the carriage and he runs and pulls it along 
Pulls 
Yes 
It might do you some good 
Good old Australian batteries 
Well they were probably old ones then 
Do you want to play cards 
Do you want to play cards 
Fun 
right games 
Yellow sunshine 
It 's fucking yellow 
Sometimes it 's very pale sometimes it 's so orange 
Oh I don't really care 
Ready 
Now who goes first 
Me of course 
My dad 's bigger than your dad 
He is if I say he is 
You 've got to you have to get four in a row 
I can't see it from here 
I don't know 
I mean he 'll ring to say when he 's coming round 
Your go 
I 'll find out when he rings 
Four or something 
Natalie 's moving out of the flat 
Why 
Yeah 
Cos she 's got somewhere else to live 
No she 's just got somewhere else to live 
I don't know why she 's going 
She just is 
Well how can they keep up with the rent without two extra people 
They 'll have to find 
Well I think it 's fully paid up 
Oh right 
Does he have to find an extra person then 
Yeah Natalie 's a weirdo 
pain in the arse 
Well anybody who keeps a whole uhm 
She gave up smoking and then when she started again she kept them 
Apparently that 's a pretty good idea 
That 's one 
That 's one 
One nil 
Can't you just see that 
Getting attached to a goldfish bowl full of cigarette butts and water 
Really lovely 
Very cuddly 
Will you shut the bottom 
In the nicest possible way of course 
father 
can you really 
I 'll have to think 
What 's wrong with you 
I what 
I wasn't 
Your father 's a wonderful man 
I revere him and respect him 
You worship him 
Mmm 
I wouldn't say worshipped 
I just loved him dearly 
Really 
Honour him 
Pardon 
It is your go 
I know 
What 
No you 're so thick 
Two nil 
Pardon 
You 're very insulting 
Am I 
Well which 
I 'll start 
Demon 
All right 
Dirigible 
Dinner 
Donkey 
Or an R one O one 
Donkey 
dick 
You did that one 
You can't do the same one twice 
Drink 
Drug 
You did all those 
Dirigible 
Come on 
Your imagination is 
I love it when you work your brain 
Detoxicate 
I don't know if that exists 
All right 
it does exist 
No it doesn't 
It does 
Disraeli 
Disraeli 's a proper noun 
You can't have that 
I said words beginning with D 
nouns or 
Now who set up this game 
Excuse me 
Look 
it 's a general rule of all word games 
well sometimes in crosswords the bad ones 
You don't use proper nouns 
Disinterested 
Oh that 's a good one 
Shut up 
You haven't been able to come up with much 
Dick twice 
Well these these are proper words 
Shut up 
Yeah go on 
I love it when you act like a four-year-old 
Go on 
Depreciate 
That 's a good old thirty-two-year-old stockbroker word 
four-year-old 
But is is it your go or is it my go 
What 
You won 
When 
I didn't even see it 
Six one 
It is not 
Yes it is 
It 's two one 
Six one 
Two one 
and then plus a bonus of 
No plonker isn't the right word 
What does what matter 
What does it matter what the right word is 
Bastard 
plonker 
I mean does it matter 
Well 
No 
We thought perhaps that one 
No I don't like that 
No 
Right 
OK 
It 's just got a blue background and the birds and would go well 
Yes and the birds 
No but it 's too much 
Don't forget that here 
Ah 
Fabric here and fabric there 
It 's 
I I couldn't cope with all those roses 
Ah 
predominantly what you will see is the lining because the lining we thought would tie in with the bedhead 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Yes 
You 're going to have your half tester effect 
Yes 
Yes 
Yes but I I di didn't want you to skimp on the curtains over the bed 
No 
I don't mind 
You 
No but it 'll be it 'll be if you decide to have blue it 'll be the blue that you see 
Yes 
It will just be the outside little bit 
uhm 
Well 
Anything anything 
You see uhm 
I mean i 
You see that sort of thing 
and then you 'd have that above the pictures 
And then you could have these tails if you wish 
They are nice 
Uhm 
Yes lots lots of permutations 
When you con 
Yes 
If we tip the swags on their sides 
uh these swags 
you don't have to have them going straight along 
You could have it coming down there 
Well actually that 's a problem 
It would probably work in the corner wouldn't it 
Yes 
Yes actually 
So what do you think 
Do you think to stick with the blue walls 
And this would add just a touch of warmth 
Yes I think so 
In fact that particular colour it goes quite well here 
How does it go with the bedhead 
I think it goes very well 
What 
quite well with the bedhead 
It 's quite good isn't it 
Uhm 
Yes it is because it will be stitched 
It 'll be behind won't it 
Well no because you can choose the the material to match the bed clothes 
that 's what I 'm saying 
So in fact when you talk about not having too many flowers around you 're going to have something like that in reverse 
You 're going to have the main curtain fabric there and there 
Do you see what I mean 
Yes 
Yes 
That 's quite good Brenda 
Yes that that 's I always think that 's probably it 
That was rather sombre 
What 
for the blinds 
Well yes 
The bit behind the bed 
Yes yes 
Very much like your bedhead 
This is what I 'm really saying 
The blinds 
Yes 
Yes it is 
Uhm 
So we have we have thought that we thought you 'd go for that 
No I don't like that 
Ah it 's a shame 
Yeah sorry 
That 
aspects it 's 
No it 's too many roses 
Uhm 
Uhm 
But something like that 
That sort of background perhaps but not quite so heavy 
We brought this because it was similar to the crinkly that you liked before 
Yes there was a crinkly one earlier a sort of palace one I thought 
Yes 
But really to point out with that really this would not go with anything swaggy because that 's traditional and this is far too modern 
So if you wanted bows and things it really looks a clash 
No 
A fabric with bows 
For curtains 
With the curtains yes 
But no roses 
No 
No flowers 
No flowers 
just bows 
but until I see it I don't know 
And you see that that uh s hollyhocks and swags could be too too much couldn't it 
I 'm thinking if you have the right colours 
with the bows 
I haven't 
Sue Sue will be quite Sue will be quite happy 
She 's very welcome to come in if she wants to 
Is sh she settling down somewhere 
Can can I just sit on your loo 
Now boys go into my son 's bedroom 
yes 
There 's a stool there 
pink in this and the pink in the bows o of the fabric 
Uhm 
Yes 
So it 's really just 
Uhm 
And he will be happy sticking to blue wallpaper won't he 
He will be by the time I 've finished with him 
Yeah 
So it 's written 
I mean I can probably get a better blue than that 
uh you know 
Yes this is more the blue 
Yes once I know 
Once I 've got it then I can have a look 
Yes 
Wi could I show this to him 
Can you do without this 
Until when because we 've got the bank holiday weekend 
Yes please do yes 
Oh well don't worry 
Well I 'll get round it 
You might need it on Saturday 
I mean it 's an avenue 
No no don't worry 
it 's an unusual book box so if you can see the sort of permutations 
It is lovely 
Well this is what I wanted to do because it is a nice room 
I wanted to make it special which it certainly isn't at the moment 
Yes 
Uhm uhm uhm 
And I think using that would make it special because it 's unusual 
Yes 
Yes 
you know 
isn't it lovely 
It 's absolutely lovely 
tha 
And I also don't see that there 's any link between between the bit you 're interested 
that 's geraldine and 
Yes 
I I 'd use that 
There you see 
Too much geraldine in this room 
And I think that th 
Geraldine in the fabric 
fabric 
yes I wasn't 
tha tha 
that 's really my problem 
No that 's true 
Yes 
I think we have to be careful with the fabric cos there 's so much of it 
I don't want it to shout which I think that does 
You 're looking at the window 
Don you 're the client 
now just shut up and listen to me 
I don't think there is that much 
Uhm 
To stay here is it 
You 're going to you 're not going to draw your curtains 
you 're going to have them back as dress curtains 
We never draw bedroom curtains 
So therefore there isn't going to be that much fabric 
Well there is because I like them rather more full than less full 
No 
if if sometimes like when it 's snowing 
fine 
I mean I 'm not I 'm not talking you into having a fabric 
I just wonder whether in your mind you think that there 's going to be more than there actually is because you 're going to have two dress curtains two c two curtains there 
Yeah well the point is 
If I want them to 
If you want them to 
But in the main it 's going to be that much fabric that you 're going to be either side 
and the bed is going to be predominantly that that you see with just the fabric on the sides and again across the top 
We 're doing a sort of half tester effect I suppose 
It 's the same 
Because I want double 
Showing yes 
Yes 
What have we decided to do here 
Did we decide on an angle 
Yes the same the same as that to have dress curtains at the s well have curtains that will draw 
Here 
Ah 
But do you see but there 's not a lot of space so we 're going to lose light 
he can he can fix 
Uhm 
Right keep going 
Be rather sort of gracious 
Uhm 
Well that 's what I 'm after really 
particularly with the table 
Yes 
Yes 
And then I can just I won't have to get rid of this 
true true 
and it 's 
No 
Blue 
Uhm 
What with some 
Very very pale blue would do wouldn't it 
Oh yes 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Yes so 
Or at least you could 
Well you could 
can you see it 
Is there anything else in here 
There 's there 's there are 
There are bows that go with that 
Yes and there 's the a blue wire at the back actually but I 'm not sure of the colour 
what do you think 
Uhm 
glass 
No that 's not quite the right colour 
Hasn't got 
It goes with the mat better than that 
That 's the green 
This is becoming to look greener which is 
Uhm it is too 
But the bows 
are they on the next sheet 
They have a rosette 
Yes 
They have bows and then they 
if you want them to 
Ribbons 
Ribbons that 
Y 
Yes 
I have actually above pictures 
Yeah 
Yes 
It 's quite a 
No I don't like that here Brenda 
Yes I 'm just uhm 
Yes you have to be careful what 's available in what colour 
general checkup 
It 's just just routine yes 
All has been well since we last met 
Uhm yes 
in the front in these two middle teeth in the front there seems to be a bit of a rough edge 
Yes 
You 're right 
I see you 've actually chipped some enamel from this bit 
Oh really 
It probably needs just a little smoothing down 
Yeah 
There may be a little bit of tartar build up as well which has cracked off 
low levels of tartar which I 'll just clean 
Yes we last saw you in July about six months ago 
Yeah 
Yes it isn't tartar 
chipping there 
It just means disking it or sanding 
I had that machine running this morning with a previous patient 
so I 'm not sure I 'd if it 's switched on 
an inbuilt speaker on the machine so the playback won't tell me 
I 've got to actually find some phones to plug in 
so I shall take it home 
I wouldn't leave it here over the weekend anyway 
nothing at all 
one last time just for cleaning 
Uhm 
Right 
Yeah 
That 's excellent 
Very good 
I had a clean up 
They don't really need a clean this time 
They 're better than they have been 
Good 
Whatever you 've been doing you 've been doing the right thing 
Uhm ah yes 
Yes 
Talking about sanding one thinks of Black and Decker paintbrushes 
Well you 've got it right in one 
It 's the same thing 
isn't it 
You 've got it right in one 
There you are 
the uh but they just they clip on 
What happens is that the the uh the teeth wear to a sort of chiselled edge 
is worn down to a very very fine chisel edge 
It 's unstable 
Unsupported 
and you just find little bits chip off 
That 's why this is to smooth them and round them off 
Extraordinary 
Just like a Black and Decker 
Unsupported 
Uhm absolutely 
Now you uhm won't actually see any difference 
I haven't taken anything off the left 
I 've just blunted the chisel if you like 
That 's all I 've done 
is I think I 've put a chamfer on at that angle 
That 's where the edges were 
wears that way on this one and and that way on the other one 
No no 
Precisely 
Oh yes 
Yes 
Uhm 
No I can feel the difference all you know straight away 
Yup 
So 
Uhm 
Uhm I suppose it 's the age isn't it 
Good 
Steady as you go 
That should see you through until 
Till July 
July August 
Summer holiday time 
I think 
uh are you going to have a holiday this year 
Oh yes 
Well we 're having a holiday 
but we 're trying to decide what to do 
I think we had a very successful holiday last year doing nothing 
You have to 
So you just stayed at home 
No 
My daughter 's marriage in in uh Mar uh May last year rather crippled us financially 
so and also we hadn't with all the arrangements we had to do for that we didn't uhm really make any plans for a holiday 
so we just sort of messed around at home 
Really was a great success 
You often sort of pull up your roots and go away in the best part of the summer 
and you miss the garden at its best miss all the produce at its best 
Got the relatives down in Cape Town 
as it were 
Uhm uhm uhm yes yes 
A mad panic before you go and then uh 
Has he 
Which is rather nice 
as usual 
Yes well you you really need it then don't you 
but for a number of years we 've always taken an October week break 
so I think that 's the 
Yes 
Yes very relaxing 
Thanks Barry 
and is it just confined to one area of your mouth or is it general 
That 's right yes 
It 's actually the whole lot 
acids grapefruit and things because that can uhm that can do it 
Not really no 
I don't think so 
Where 's your primary problem at the moment 
You said it was fairly general 
The lower front or 
At the front here 
Yes 
Uhm 
Right out 
Lean over 
OK 
No soreness on the tongue 
Is that cold 
Right 
Have you had the flu or you 've been generally run down in the last few days 
I 've had the flu a few times actually this year 
Yeah 
Do you feel a bit low 
Are you running late nights working hard for exams or 
Burning the candle at both ends quite a bit are you 
Well I 'm I 'm just about to make a move 
I 'm actually going off to Japan and I think that 's been playing on my mind a bit 
Yeah 
OK 
the early stages of a gum infection which is not uncommon at this time of the year 
Right 
relationship 
and we can begin to see if I blow that back 
these ulcerations starting in between there 
Yeah 
Uhm 
Right 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Can you see that 
Uhm 
and the inflammation of the gums 
can you see that red line 
that causes the teeth to be inflamed in their sockets as well 
a reflex hypersensitive so the whole thing gels 
Get rid of the infection and your symptoms will subside 
Uhm 
Uhm 
I see 
Righto 
as soon as possible 
Now when are you going off to Japan 
Right 
Well actually not for another month 
Oh that 's OK now 
Well you ought to do that certainly 
and a mouthwash five times a day approximately 
Right 
OK 
and you sort of squeeze it between clenched teeth to and fro 
You know what I mean 
Right 
Uhm 
You try and squirt it between your teeth all the way round because you 're trying to get it to the intersp interphase uh interspace uh area 
Right 
Sure 
It will fizz and froth 
and you 've got to clean your teeth as best you can 
Ignore any bleeding 
They they They 're quite likely to bleed quite a bit 
Have you noticed they 've been bleeding a lot recently 
Uhm 
Yeah they have 
Yes 
OK 
When did you last have your teeth seen and cleaned 
eight months ago uhm and had the very early beginnings of cleaning 
and I I I didn't it really hurt and I didn't go back 
Yes 
Yeah 
but it 's only sort of palliative 
It 's killing off the germs of the moment 
so we want to clean them up thoroughly 
to get them clean 
and then come and see me for a general scrape round before you go to Japan 
Yeah 
Uhm 
Right 
Right 
OK 
OK 
All right 
Uh if it goes to acute it 's very destructive 
right down to the bone 
Yes 
and if particularly if the patient is uhm very run down 
It was It 's very infectious in you know in a debilitated community which they were in the trenches 
but it 's uh it 's not it is technically contagious uh 
but uh you 'd probably be wise to keep your own uh utensils wash up separately 
You know sensibly you 'll you 'll be over this in a couple of days 
Around the tooth 
Right 
Right 
Right 
Uhm 
Right 
Uh and I can get this from any chemist can I or 
Eighty-four Endymon Endymion 
Endymion Road 
Brixton 
You did well to get here 
What are you going to do in Japan 
Teach English actually 
Uhm 
I do appreciate you seeing me so quickly though 
About five times a day use the mouthwash 
Just repeat that 
OK 
Uhm 
But certainly before you go to bed 
All right 
And how long do I keep it in my mouth 
Well a couple of minutes swishing it to and fro to and fro and then don't wash out with anything afterwards 
Leave it in your mouth 
but uh leave it round to do its job 
Right 
No 
Right 
There 's the prescription 
There 's a chemist in Store Street just as you go out straight across the road towards the Tottenham Court Road 
There 's a chemist about three shops along 
and book in with me for a general check round as well 
OK 
but uh 
Is the crack evident 
It it 's a hairline crack 
and it also be would be across or parallel to the plane of the X-ray 
so you 'd be looking across the crack rather than down it 
It 's unnecessary radiation in many respects 
Yes 
Hairline 
Right yes yes 
otherwise I 'm I 'm uh going away in February for uh two weeks to uh the uh to do some neutron scattering 
that surely 
Uhm 
Oh yes yeah yes 
Yes 
In fact the uh uhm I don't know what the dose for uh a a typical medical X-ray is 
but it 's usually stated to us that uh that is considerably greater than the uh than the uh level of rad background radiation you 'd get if you spent a couple of weeks by a reactor 
on to the right 
Right yes 
Yes right 
Oh 
Yes 
Yes yes yes 
Yes yes 
Yes yes yes 
The The uh films you still have to essentially uh the 
it 's still wet film process 
There 's There 's no sort of polaroid instant developed yet 
Yes it 's wet 
we have 
Uh no no but we have a dry-to-dry process 
but it 's just mechanically dried at the end of it 
Uh we post it through developer fixer wash dry 
Do you have anything to do with uh is it CERN or the Taur European Taurus and all that 
Yes 
well I 'm I 'm 
I 'm physics department 
you know 
as such 
You 're crystallography 
aren't you 
Yes it 's not yes 
More to do with the crystallography side is it 
Uhm yes 
Uh my cousin 's son is an architect in Japan and uh he was talking about all the work they 're doing on the uh new monorail type things with the uh makeweights uh levitation motors and so on 
and uh they 're very exciting of course 
Yes 
Yes yes yes 
That 's right 
yes yes 
Yes yes 
That 's the sort of thing that I I 'm really the the the at the very basic materials end essentially doing what we think is the strategic research that in ten or twenty years ' time will hopefully be uh bear fruit in that uh in that research 
Yes 
Bear fruit 
Uhm 
Yeah 
liquid nitrogen 
aren't they 
yes yes yes 
Now 
Yes 
Cos liquid nitrogen 's cheap 
yes I always compare it 
Liquid Uh liquid nitrogen is the s is the same price as milk 
In fact it 's cheaper than milk and uh liquid helium 's about the same price as uh wine 
Whereas liquid helium is uh 
Yes 
up a little bit 
uhm the effect of these huge magnetic fields on potential passengers and so on 
to travel on them unless they can screen them better 
Sorry 
Yes 
Yeah 
Yeah they 
The the the The residual field is still quite small but the problem is that these pacemakers are sensitive to it to very small fields 
Very small 
That 's right 
That 's Uh that 's a problem 
The uh the The technical difficulty at the moment with these new superconductor materials is to turn them into wires because the they 're ceramic and so uh as you can imagine it 's very hard to make them into wires 
The uh 
Wires 
that 's right 
Ceramics 
You presumably can at very high temperatures 
You can spin them out uh although you have to actually make the coil you know a semi-molten state and then it 's set into that coil 
inside them 
Yes 
Rather like a fibre optic glass 
Yes something like that 
Yes 
Because the thickness won't matter would it because if they 've got a negative resistance they can't heat up 
That 's 
that 's 
that 's uh 
that 
I mean OK I 'm sorry zero resistance 
Zero resistance 
Yes 
Yes yes 
Or all but zero which resistance 
No it really is zero 
Yes 
sort of records 
and it 's still going around 
It 's still going 
Uhm 
But uhm the first application to actually come in is satellites because uh uh in the uh microwave repeaters that are uh uh used to uh harness satellite uh television 
To boost the signal yes 
To boost the signal 
Uh money doesn't count 
They 're expensive to make at the moment 
or even nuclear reactors 
Yes 
Yes 
I 'm not 
I 'm I 'm 
I 'm I 'm not very happy with that because uh that is uh that is how the Russians powered uh the 
Well I mean they 're putting chunks of plutonium up there which in fact they are 
then that plutonium is going to shatter and disintegrate over quite a large area of the country 
The last one came down in w wastes of Canada which is probably quite providential because if it came over a populated area it wouldn't be very nice for them 
I suppose 
Yes 
Well even even the stuff being spread around in the atmosphere but uh 
Well that 's that 's it but I don't think the plutonium does 
It tends to come down as a as a lump 
It 's a bit more 
Yes it sh if it 's properly shielded you know it should do 
Yes yes but the burn up uh probably destroys the shield and the thing probably develop comes back to earth in a lump and probably shatters on impact and then it 's uh in the environment 
We learn the hard way though don't we the human race 
We make mistakes 
Yes but uh I want to take the amalgam out 
Take the mirror Professor 
That is the the filling taken out of the cavity 
There was no lining 
You can still see a little bit of amalgam in the depths there 
Now I don't know if I 've got the angle of the mirror right 
said it would go 
I can see it 
It looks like a hairline just down at the bottom 
Light 
Uhm uhm 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Uhm 
It 's fore and aft as it were 
and there 
the light going straight that 
Uhm 
Uhm 
Uhm uhm 
OK I 'll I 'll clear out the cavity 
How long have you made that one last 
Before my time that one 
Yes yes well I had I had I lived in France for six years 
Not being a lover of the French I would blame the French 
Gillian 
Yeah 
first 
I suppose that 's a source of helium they need balloons for now in the in the gas industry rather than the liquification of air 
Yes 
Yes it comes from oil wells 
Yes uhm 
Most of it comes from Texas the gas 
I think I can show you that crack 
will you 
Pass that diagnostic light again 
how about I mean you just put that so you can actually see into the cavity 
Can you see that 
I can 
Uhm uhm 
Yes I can see it clearly there 
Right 
you 've got you 've got discoloration here 
so it 's already been penetrated 
I mean the raw material I mean 
How you fashion them of course is the big big problem 
but are they expensive in themselves 
The raw mat material 
But they have to be made as a coil 
many many c many many turns 
is proportional to the number of turns 
N squared in fact 
I think it 's N squared 
that 's the uh that 's that 's uh the problem project 
A whole series of them 
Wires 
Yes 
Yes 
Yes 
No 
I 'm now what are your movements 
You say you 're going abroad 
Right 
I can come any essentially any time before then 
And how long will you be away 
Uh well I 'm I 'm away uhm for two uh I 'm away for two weeks uh 
uhm 
and when I can 
Yes 
Is there any sort of window time between you arriving back and going to Abingdon 
There 's a there 's a day there 's a Monday morning 
Well what I 'm saying is if if 
Uh the temporary will be quite satisfactory 
uhm 
and then we could cement the crown on that window before you went to Abingdon 
or we could in fact if it 's only three weeks in total no reason to rush it 
but uhm I think it would be bearing in mind you are going away 
and that 's the inconvenience of it 
Yes yes 
Right 
Yes 
Right 
Yes 
Yes 
OK 
Yes yes yes 
So you put you put in the sedative is it and uh 
The sedative was that white stuff 
I put it cos that 's the deepest part of the cavity and then I 've actually filled this uh main body of the tooth with a glass and metal cement 
uh 
and then you 've got this problem point where you get the leverage effect like that 
so I 'm going to reduce that point down 
so you haven't got the leverage effect 
and so it 's 
Right 
Yes 
Uhm 
Right yes 
Yes 
Right that 's that 's the dangerous point for the thing cracking off 
I 'm actually going back to Denmark for two weeks 
Is that where you 're going to throw your neutrons about 
Facility there 
Have you been there before 
Yes I have 
Danes are nice people 
aren't they 
Yes yes they 're extremely friendly when you get to know them 
Yes 
When you get to know them yes 
but they 're a bit reserved 
I think most of the Scandinavians are 
yes 
But the Danes are the easiest to get to know 
That 's right 
Is that still too difficult to bite with 
OK 
Feels all right now uhm 
Just just slide your teeth together 
It 's actually like a chisel 
What 's the problem 
Well I 'm on 
Have you 
Yeah 
Yes 
and you had some Canesten 
Did that improve it to begin with 
Uhm yes 
No no 
It would start off OK and then it goes again 
Start off again 
And have you had thrush in the past 
Uhm I had it about two years ago 
Oh not since then no 
No no 
And you 're on the pill 
That makes it a bit more likely 
You don't like a-few-words-obscured-by-telephone-ring 
That 's the third funny call I 've had 
You haven't had a a swab sent off to the lab 
No 
to just to check what it is 
What 's the date 
If you 'll just come next door 
OK 
OK 
OK what 's the problem 
I came last week and saw the practice nurse and actually had a positive pregnancy test 
right and that 's not good news 
no 
And I 'm not sure of my dates 
what I would usually expect and I have done pregnancy tests on those occasions but they were negative 
Uh uhm 
Yeah 
uhm periods 
And that was a light one 
all of it uhm 
Yeah 
But very clotty 
Now uhm were you using any form of contraception 
Yes I use the cap and spermicide 
Uhm 
And you 've been using that for some time 
So you 're quite good at it you thought 
I think what I what I 'd better do actually is examine you and see whether the uterus is enlarged to a certain level 
we can refer you for a termination 
Sure 
Uhm well I 've heard E T A is good 
You 're happy to go there 
Uh uhm 
Yeah although you 're connected 
OK if you 'd like to come next door we 'll just examine you 
Uhm now what 's the problem at the moment 
Uh it 's not a problem 
I 've run out of Binoxon cream that I use for my back 
I was wondering if you 'd give me another prescription for it 
What 's it called the the 
I have actually got the empty tube with me 
Binoxon 
Yes 
Yes does that help 
Yes there wa 
Yes 
Yes 
Uh uhm 
Now I saw you was it a year ago when you were having back pain 
Yes 
Yes 
So how have you been since then 
No 
Not so bad 
Oh how has the back been 
Uhm it happened once in the summer and I started getting pain in the bottom of my back in the same place 
so I just took uh some of the tablets you gave me and it cleared up within two days 
That 's just happened once 
Yeah 
Uhm 
Uhm 
That 's good 
Are you very active 
Do you do sports and things 
I see 
I just started playing this term 
Yes how is that going 
That 's fine 
In fact I 'm really enjoying it and 
Are you in the college team 
Yes 
Yes so you 're beating everybody 
Yes so far 
Reading 's beaten us but we beat name 
Yeah 
Uh I 'm getting pains in my legs just when I 'm running but I think that 's just because I haven't run around a lot 
Yeah 
Well I think one of the problems is if you run to train if you can possibly do it just run on grass and not on on concrete 
Uhm yeah I do 
You do yes 
Well that 's not so bad then 
OK 
So I 'll give you the prescription for this 
Is there anything else you need 
No 
Thirty grams 
And your health is otherwise good 
Are you taking any other medicines 
And you 're not on the pill 
No 
And how 's work going now 
That 's fine now I really 
I hated London last year but uhm 
You got used to it 
It 's a bit of a shock to begin with 
isn't it 
I presume you 've changed address since last year 
Yes 
OK 
Here 's your prescription 
Thanks very much 
Right 
Keep you going OK 
Bye 
Bye 
Bye bye 
two o'clock 
I 've got a tutorial at two 
Well if you see Genevieve will you say that we 're going to Palms 
Yeah 
Yes 
So you 're going to Palms 
in a minute 
In a minute 
Well I 'll see you up there 
You 're going with the girls aren't you Billy 
yes you are you lying bugger 
Caroline are you coming the pub tonight 
No I 'm not coming to the pub tonight 
I 'm going to Birkbeck 
Why not 
I have to swot 
Anyway listen 
so when are we going together then to do this revision 
Well look 
shall I call you at the weekend 
if I call in with you one day on the way up there or on the way back then I 've got the stuff 
Cos I need it to revise 
you need it to revise as well 
I know I 'm sure 
every single one of us 
Were you Joan 
were you lost in Richard 's seminar the other night 
Yeah right 
I really enjoyed it 
Did you get the implications of everything then 
No 
I don't I don't suppose there was anything fantastically useful 
but it was just interesting 
Uhm 
Oh right 
oh good 
So you really haven't missed any of the no 
Yes yes 
What about the translation 
Did he go through that 
No what he did in 
side of Beowulf 
Did you feel like that 
Uhm right 
What did you get up to 
I think he didn't actually do an awful lot of translation did he 
Where 'd you get to 
Yeah 
He did that a bit 
Yes all right so 
And then he just 
More than a few hundred 
No I wouldn't have thought so Joan 
No no we 've only done two hundred lines 
No 
Oh OK good 
why was he so keen 
He glossed over that 
uh a champion a mercenary 
Well he it 's unusual for a champion to be 
No he he could either have one or the other 
that 's what he was saying 
No that 's right yeah 
Uh uh I don't know what it gave me 
I didn't particularly want the 
So he really made a tactical mistake to go after the dragon himself 
He was then a king 
Yes he should have been king yeah 
So what about Wiglaf then continuing the line 
Cos he was one of the Wig Wiglaf 
Is this Wigmun yeah Wigmunding 
Right uh it 's not 
he 's somewhere 
He 's not yet 
Has Is Jane here today 
She is actually 
She is 
Where is she 
Well I shan't see her 
that 's for sure 
What did you want to ask me Joan 
Uh nothing except about Jane 
Where 
Billy found it on the top of the pigeon holes 
Yes 
I thought so 
I 'm not sure 
Well it 's Jane 's or Isla 's isn't it 
Actually he 
and it isn't there 
Are you going to go Caroline 
Yes 
Are you going 
we 're going to the cry to the Palms actually 
Are you coming 
Georgie you 're going to miss the party 
Joan you vandal 
So OK we 'll we 'll do Elena All right 
with me 
Actually let 's go over let 's go over the Fall of the Angels Elena and Judith 
so that we can prepare 
Yeah 
Let 's look at the women 
So we can discuss it yeah OK yeah right 
OK brilliant 
it 's only two 
Oh right 
Listen 
I I 've got to get 
Are you coming to Palms for lunch 
OK then 
No I 've got I 'm waiting for Georgina 
She 's bringing in her boyfriend and then we 're going to lunch with him 
Right 
OK 
All right then I 'll see you later or I 'll speak to you on the phone 
All right 
Well he 's not really her boyfriend he 's a uh 
Is he 
All right 
See you 
Come and see me if you want to 
Yeah well in the holidays if I 'm uhm passing by that in that direction 
Oh just give a ring 
I mean I 'd be either I 'd be there or leave a message 
OK then 
Right so there you are eh 
That was great 
Oh I made this big thing about how I got these two long essays to do this term you see 
that 's this term 
Oh I see 
Oh so he accepted that 
He didn't say anything to me 
I said I don't want to do any more essays 
He said oh yes you are 
Now what 's happening to this thing here 
Oh I tell you what 
I 've got this stupid course essay to finish 
Oh I can't 
I 'm not doing the course essay 
I re put myself down for it but I 'm not doing it 
Well I 
Uhm hello 
Hello dear how are you 
How are you 
I haven't seen you for ages 
No I 've been in hiding lying low 
What have you been up to 
Have you been doing your old opera 
My old opera 
No 
What happens with that 
I wrote I turned up the first night right 
Because I Because I didn't have time to do sewing you know 
She wanted me to anyway I 'll tell you to do dressmaking the first night 
Uhm 
Uhm 
They hadn't put me down in the programme 
I 'm an assistant manager and they hadn't put me down 
I know because I didn't turn up for the last two weeks 
Really 
Stupid 
I wasn't expecting anything major 
cos I put in maybe you know fifteen hours work on this thing 
Yes of course 
Good God yeah 
And I saw him and I 'd forgotten 
And I said sort of oh hello oh all right 
And then he said uh will you play for the opera for me sort of thing and I said oh you know maybe I 'll I 'll consult 
Yeah exactly 
and he kept saying well you 'll definitely be really good you know 
I mean he 's only playing fourth anyway 
And I said well maybe you know I 'll look in my you know in my diary 
He is 
He is I know 
Awful 
Oh fatal mistake 
For him 
So I thought and I 'm really stupid about this 
And I gave it to him and I thought he 'll never sort of get me anyway cos it 's Goldsmith House and you can never get through 
So I gave it to him thinking I was fairly safe 
and he recognised it 
and he said ooh it 's Goldsmith House isn't it 
The girl I 'm seeing at the moment lives there and I thought oh shit 
And I live on the same floor as his bloody girlfriend a few doors away 
I can't believe it 
And he turned up at my door 
There was this knock on the door and I opened it and sort of tried to close it again 
slammed the door into my bedroom 
It was remarkable 
you know 
I said wait a minute 
It was just incredible cos my body language 
And that slime he was in my room saying have you got a pen you know 
I walked out 
So what happened 
Did he turn up 
This guy did not want to know 
You didn't leave him there
