 The  changeover from the first to the second stage is as you probably know widely thought to be the reform inaugurated by King Josiah in uh six hundred and twenty-one B C when he discovered the law book in the Temple and carried out a reform which very closely agrees with the measures proposed in Deuteronomy 
 Anyway the second stage is represented in Deuteronomy and is thought to reflect what happened in Israel 's religion between Josiah 's reform in six hundred and twenty-one and the Exile 
 uh or really I should say it later than the Exile until the fifth century until really the mission of Nehemiah the mission of Ezra and Nehemiah in the middle of the fifth century  
 The reason for the change seems to be that the author of the book found in the Temple uh the author of the book found in the year six hundred and twenty-one in the Temple in Josiah 's reign was uh concerned that the many sanctuaries that at that point had existed all over the country and the free access  which everyone enjoyed to the priestly office had meant that all sorts of possibly undesirable forms of worship were occurring 
 So he wants to bring it under control and say the only place where you could worship was the Temple in Jerusalem and the only people who could offer sacrifice were the members of this one tribe the tribe of Levi 
 So there was a a definite narrowing which seems to have taken place at that point from the year six hundred and twenty-one  
 The Levites had a role in the lur in the other temples didn't they 
 Ah yes 
 But a different role  uh because when we get to the time of uh Ezra as with the more classical Wellhausen uh hypothesis when we get to the time of Ezra we have the further narrowing of the office of priest  
 No longer can any member of the tribe of Levi  act as priest  
 There is one particular family those who trace their descents to Aaron 
 they are the priests 
 The other Levites are subordinate to them 
 The people have now divided into three sections priests on the top other Levites some are called simply Levites  that league beneath them and reduced to menial service to the priests and then beneath them the ordinary Israelites  
 Uhm 
 I thought that was what Ezekiel said 
 Uh Ezekiel it 's true was moving towards that 
 that uh if Ezekiel had the idea Ezra and Nehemiah put it into practice  
 So uh that was why I was hesitating and saying or down to the Exile 
 Down to the Exile so far as the theory goes 
 Down to  Ezra and Nehemiah so far as the actual practice goes 
 And what about the rebellion of Cora and all that 
 I thought that also was because the Levites were so upset that they weren't allowed to do what the Aaronites could do 
 Indeed  
 Many think that the story of the rebellion of Cora dates to uh the time of Ezra and Nehemiah when Ezra and Nehemiah were  forcing through this new regime with the Levites being  put under the thumb of the priests 
 Yes 
 And Well some people think that this piece was written in order to show uh that these Levites were up to no good  
 And the the story was written in order to reflect the discontent of the Levites at that time though it was projected back into Moses ' day  
  
 So before the centralisation of the Temple  you had local temples where anybody could do whatever they liked in them more or less 
  could be officiating 
 Mm mm 
 That 's right 
 uh Yes 
 And this is thought to be representative of parts of Genesis as well as those laws in Exodus which I mentioned uhm 
 laws in Exodus Twenty 
 and the following chapters uh 
 because you see  Abraham and Jacob going up and down the country consecrating places  like Bet-El 
 If you read the description as to how Jacob spent the night in Bet-El and he says how wondrous is this place this is the gate to Heaven this is the house of God you would really think from that that uhm Bet-El was going to be the site of a glorious temple 
 And there were people who believed that Bet-El is the site of a glorious temple 
 It w was that even north in Israel  
 But from the viewpoint of the south and also from the viewpoint of much of the Pentateuch Bet-El is an awful place 
 It 's an illegitimate shrine  
 So  Wellhausen found  many different stages 
 You see he found traces of all three stages in the Pentateuch 
 They were the stage where anyone could offer sacrifice the stage where it was restricted to a single site and to the tribe of Levi and then the narrowest stage of all where it 's restricted to a single site and to the family of Aaron 
 and the Levites  are their servants 
 So we  have these three stages 
 And when we try to bring the Book of Malachi into that framework it does seem that Malachi moves in the world of the second stage in the world of D or of Deuteronomy 
 Uh because he too equates Levites and priests 
 He knows of no distinction between the two  
 Look at Chapter Three Verse Three how God will purify the children of Levi like silver and gold like gold and silver and they will be offering sacrifices to the Lord in righteousness  
 Not the  children of Aaron the children of Levi  
 Similarly the priests are called Levi or children of Levi in  in Chapter Two Verse Four uh 
 My covenant is with Levi 
 he says to them 
 but he addresses them as in Two Verse One the priests 
 You see 
 So if you put together Two One and Two Four you again have this equation 
 priests equals Levite which is the one you find in Deuteronomy running right through that book  
 So and And all the religious institutions which Malachi mentions uh the tithe the  offering the ban on offering lame animals and so on are already found in Deuteronomy 
 There 's nothing in Malachi that compels us to suppose that uh Malachi was familiar with the P portions of the Pentateuch that is with those portions which presuppose that more complicated cult with priests distinguished from Levites And 
 And so on 
 Another point of contact with Deuteronomy is that he calls the Mountain of Revelation Horeb in Chapter Three Verse Twenty-Two as the Deuteronomy does and not Sinai 
 Of course that 's only That 's only a small point 
 So the  upshot of that is that if one tries to view Malachi against the background of the hypothesis of development of Israel 's religion as Wellhausen proposed then one comes down pretty squarely  in the period before priests and Levites were separated 
 And you 're right to say that the idea comes from Ezekiel 
 But you must remember this 
 until Ezra and Nehemiah there were no powerful personalities to organise the people and to put into practice such a far-reaching change 
 One needed someone like Ezra and/or Nehemiah people who came with the backing of the Persian government  in order to  make such a far-reaching transformation 
 But were not the priests  in the Temple in Jerusalem always Aaronites or even from  
 I always got the impression that the Levites who came from working in all the local shrines they got put out of business   
 leaving the the descendants of Zadok firmly in control in the Temple  
 Do you not think that that was the case 
 Yes 
 Yes 
 No I I 
 That probably was the case 
 I think that  Deuteronomy was  not altogether practical in foreseeing the effects of uh implementing the Law 
 The fact 
 the factor who you had that Zadok  
 Yeah  
 Yes I think I  
 Yes I I think this is this is why you 've got a third stage 
 I think in the first stage uh you 've got  
 Yeah yes 
 Uh in large measure I think that 's probably so 
 In the first stage you 've got an absolute free for all 
 Then I should think uh before the time of Deuteronomy you 've got a specialist class emerging the Levites 
 but they don't have any legal rights 
 It 's just the people recognise them as being better at the job but they don't have a statutory uh monopoly on offering sacrifice 
 Uh this idea that Levites are better at their job is uh I think we can notice quite clearly from that story at the end of Judges 
 I think Judges Chapter Eighteen where a man has a private shrine where he dedicates his son as the priest but when a wandering Levite comes he 's much happier 
 He says now I 've got all blessings because I got a Levite to be my priest 
 So I think you got yes before Deuteronomy informal recognition of the Levite 
 Then Deuteronomy comes along 
 and he tightens up 
 and he says 
 right no one but a Levite can be a priest 
 and no way would in Jerusalem  sacrifice be offered 
 And uh his hope is that sufficient employment will be found  for all the people at the different shrines who are in fact already Levites in Jerusalem 
 So  when he restricts sacrifice to a single site he is making real change because until now sacrifices had been conducted everywhere 
 But when he restricts the office of priest to the Levites he 's not making real change because it 's very likely that uh Levites were already in office in these places 
 He is simply saying officially you 've got to be a Levite 
 And then as you say uh  Deuteronomy hoped that all the Levites would somehow find employment in the Temple in Jerusalem 
 And uh Deuteronomy also continually commends the Levite along with the widow and the orphan for charity  uh just in case they don't find employment 
 And in the end they don't uh because as you say the priests in Jerusalem in service in Jerusalem hang on to their jobs 
 And And uh so you get in effect the local Levites uh being degraded 
 And when the next stage occurs when this is actually set down in a book in a law this is no more than recognition of the situation that 's already arisen 
 So that yes you 're right to point out that as regards  both the restriction of worship to Levites in the time of D  and as regards the restriction of worship to priests in the time of Ezra in the time of P the law is lagging behind practice 
 It 's simply codifying what has  already happened for for different reasons 
 The Levite In uh these times the Levite 's already taken over 
 Because of a general tendency to specialise they 've acquired for some reason their speciality and professionalism 
 And in the time of P the reason that the  that the priests are given this monopoly is that  they 've got it 
 And uh Ezekiel can see it coming and as he says in theory this is the way it 's got to be 
 And it 's then actually made into an institution It 's 
 It 's promulgated 
 It 's decreed in the time after in the time after Malachi 
  
 Even before it went wrong 
 Yeah 
 Yeah  
 One might suppose that  before the Exile 
 It wasn't that long between sixteen twenty-one and the Exile 
 But the Aaronites were in charge in Jerusalem and later when they came back again the Aaronites had lost control and had to be reinstated 
 That 's also possible yes that the Aaronites were uh weaker and that the Levites reasserted themselves 
 As you see There 's 
 There 's no 
 Is there any indication in Zechariah that the high priest was was an was an Aar was an Aaronite or 
 In Zechariah  
 No 
 But Zechariah 's historical allusions are very obscure 
 He talks about Jerusalem a lot   and he names the High Priest  
 Yes 
 But I don't think   
 Is Joshua the High Priest 
 Yes 
 It doesn't say these words precisely 
 It doesn't say that he 's the son of Aaron 
 No 
 But doesn't say what he is 
 He might not be  
 But that 's right 
 I mean at that stage it might not have been made official that you need to be from the from the family of Aaron  
 So we 've got then all these pointers to a time shortly before Nehemiah 's reform  
 And of course a late date is suggested by the fact that Malachi is the last of the prophets 
 He 's placed after Haggai and Zechariah who as you saw last week we can date pretty exactly in the late sixth century 
 So it 's not surprising to find this prophet in the early fifth century 
 So let 's take a nice simple sentence 
 Who would like to think of a simple English sentence  
 Can anyone think of a simple English sentence 
 The cat sat on the mat 
 Uh thank you   
 Cat  sat on the mat  
 Right 
 Who 's going to volun Are you volunteering to draw us a tree as well 
 That was very kind of you wasn't it   
 You 'll notice this is a new use of the term volunteer 
 Yes it is 
 It 's uhm  
 While that 's going on can everybody remind me who they are because I 've forgotten everybody 's name 
 Vicky 
 Yes 
 Vicky 
 Phil 
 Phil 
 Phil 
 Uh and you at the blackboard 
 Susan  
 Susan 
 Thank you

 Thanks

 Jason 
 Jas Oh dear 
 Thomas 
 Thomas 
 And we know about him 
 You see I shall forget again but I 'll try  
 It gets complicated around there doesn't it 
 Uh it is rather 
 I don't know what to do with that 
 It looks like a prepositional 
 Well do what you like because the more mistakes you make the more interesting it becomes 
 Oh all right 
 Uhm well I 'll do this bit  
 Uhm 
 Cos if you get it all right then you know I 'm being paid for nothing 
 That 's right uhm  
 While she 's While she 's doing that could you tell me what the  you were speaking a bit of uh nucleated form what the E in transcription what the C stands for  
 The letter C 
 I don't  
 Oh it 's like English ch in church 
 ch 
 Yeah 
 So the word for tree is  
 All right 
 Thank you 
 Can you put a prepositional phrase in there  or not 
 Just try it and see what happens  
 Oh I 'll make a mess of this now  
 OK 
 That looks pretty  
 So now we can have people object to it  if anybody wishes to object to it 
 Georgina 
 Right 
 From the P P shouldn't it  be  
 oh hang on let me think 
 before  a V P 
 And then  followed by N P 
 V P then governs on N P 
 Uhm we should have a V P where N  
 Sorry 
 Yeah 
 Why don't you come and draw it because it 's much easier than waving your hands which are not immediately transparent 
 No 
 I don't think I 'll be able to move actually 
 Well draw another V P because that 's the bit that presumably you 're worried about 
 So don't change that one 
 Change Put another V P somewhere so that we can see what you want  
 
 Can you read it 
 Yeah  
 Oops  
 Jo can you manage 
 Or can you not see that 
 I can't 
 OK 
 Uhm can you draw a tree from the blackboard so Jo can see at the same time 
 If you draw it on yeah on a bit of paper  if you 've got a spare piece of paper  
 On here 
 Yes uh uh 
 Yeah 
 I 've got this 
 Right  
 If you want a large black pencil  that 's a marker pencil which you have there  
 OK 
 So now we 've got two trees  one of which has got a prepositional phrase underneath the noun phrase 
 And the other 's got a noun phrase underneath a prepositional phrase  
 And one of them is odd 
 The top tree is odd Susan 's tree  
 Why is it odd 
 Because the prepositional phrase is  in the wrong place  
 Well if there 's something that  
 There 's no label  on one of the nodes  
 And every node is supposed to have a label  
 So what we 've got here  is some strange anonymous thing 
 Uhm  what do you think it is  
 Just that the label 's a bit 
 Uhm 
 Noun 
 It 's a noun phrase  
 You think it 's a noun 
 So you would be happy if we put in a noun phrase there 
 Yeah 
 No 
 Because it 
 No 
 You 've got one We You 'd have 
 You 'd have to rearrange that 
 Are you suggesting we can't have one noun phrase inside another noun phrase  
  
 Well when you said you 've got one that seemed to be the implication 
 Well you 've got the other one there  
 Or perhaps     
 Uh I mean you don't need one there although in principle you could have one there   
 So  let 's assume that was a noun phrase  
 Then what we 're saying is that the only difference really between those two trees is that in one case on the mat is described as a noun phrase and on the other on the mat is described as a prepositional phrase 
 There are others  
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 
 
 Draw another one 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 OK 
 That 's the mistake I wanted 
 Thank you   
 Uh  I knew it would come if I waited long enough 
 Uh  all right 
 Let 's clear up one or two things 
 and then we 'll come back because the idea of this was that we see what a constituent is  
 and we 've now got a suitable basis for doing it 
 First we notice that on is just a preposition 
 There 's no need to have a prepositional phrase  
 So we don't need both of those  
 Secondly  for the current argument  we can go straight ahead to this one to Georgina 's tree with a prepositional phrase because it is indeed the case that on the mat  is a prepositional phrase of some kind or other 
 So let me put up two different trees now which will illustrate the point that I wanted to get over  
 What we 've got is now two possibilities  
 Then the other one 
 I will cross this one out as well  
 And we 'll come back to a slight difference I am going to make  
 Or maybe I won't make it that 
 I 'll do what Vicky did  
 But sorry is this the right example 
 Is this correct now 
 Who knows 
 I really don't know   
 We 're going to vote on it  
 OK  
 So if you can put both those down the whole point is  which one is right  
 When I said we 've got the right mistake what I meant really was that we 've now got a pair of examples one of which is probably right and one of which is probably less right  
 And  uh the the bit apart from the V P is supposed to be the same  
 That doesn't matter  
 Now in each case notice we 've got the cat sat on the mat  
 OK we 've got the correct sequence of words 
 And in both cases  we have got the claim that on the mat  is a constituent  
 OK 
 So if you think how do we know that on the mat is a constituent  we 'll look at each of them  
 In each case you can trace the sequence of words on the mat  back to a single node which doesn't dominate anything else  
 the circled P P on the left  and the circled N P on the right  
 So is it clear to everyone that we 've got a constituent on the mat in each case  because if that 's not clear speak because otherwise it 'll be  a disaster 
 Oh right 
 But is on a constituent by itself as well 
 Every lexical item is a constituent 
 We can trace on back to the single node P in each case which doesn't dominate anything else 
 So lexical items are always going to be constituents  
 
 It dominates determiner and noun 
 Yes 
 
 Yes  
 That 's true 
 But for the moment all I wanted to establish was that the whole sequence on the mat  is a constituent in each tree  
 The crucial difference between the two trees  is that the one on the left  also says that the mat  is a constituent  
 The one on the right  says 
 the mat is not a constituent  
 Is that also clear to everyone  because you can trace it back to the N P exhaustively  
 In this one that 's supposed to be a P 
 I know that it doesn't look it 
 But never mind 
 Whereas if you take the mat on the right hand tree there 's no node that exhaustively dominates that determiner and noun 
 The N P does dominate it 
 But the N P there also dominates a preposition  
 OK 
 So there are two crucial differences between those two trees 
 One and the more important one says that  the mat is or is not a constituent 
 And the other one says that the sequence on the mat is a constituent either of the type prepositional phrase  or of the type noun phrase  
 And so we 'd now have to decide on both those which one 's the correct one  
 OK  
 Let 's dispose of the simpler one first as to whether it 's prepositional phrase or a noun phrase 
 What do people think 
 Who votes for prepositional phrase  
 Who votes for noun phrase  
 Well I fear the prepositional phrases have won by a large majority 
 But given that linguistics is not democratic  we can't necessarily accept that 
 Iliana why do you think it 's a noun phrase  
 
 
 Why 
 
 Well we 've done it in that tree 
 And all you have to do is write a rule that says P P goes to P N P  
 And it 's easy to do 
 But I agree there 's an interesting question as to whether it 's the right thing to do  
 What do other people What do people who voted for prepositional phrase have to say in its favour  
 Yes 
 Jo 
 Well it could be 
 I think they are equally possible 
 They 're both  
 Right 
 And it 's hard to see how you can 
 So basically you 're abstaining on this vote 
 Yes 
 Or voting on both sides which is illegal 
 Well I 'd go for a prepositional because uhm  if you look at the word the the mat the mat the mats it goes with mat not on which you can see uh on the prepositional phrase cos it goes back to noun phrase  
 But on the second one the could just be with either 
 And then  
 OK 
 But 
 OK  
 Uhm that sounds more like an argument for having a constituent N P  than an argument for saying that if you 've got the constituent N P  you should have prepositional phrase up here 
 Because there 's a third possibility  that we could 've had 
 N P  goes to P  N P  determiner noun 
 So that would satisfy your  criteria 
 But it wouldn't actually tell us uh because you 'd still have a constituent the mat 
 but it wouldn't distinguish between the prepositional phrase and the noun phrase  
 Oh yeah  
 Uh  
 Oh yeah 
 Is it that that wouldn't actually allow for verbs which do need a preposition like i e the cat sat down  
 Which wouldn't allow for the cat to sit down 
 If you had uhm a noun phrase and a preposition with the one that you 've just drawn just now 
 This one here 
 Or that one or the the 
 Or this one 
 I think 
 Yeah yeah 
 Uh it 's not going to allow us to do what 
 Verbs which require a prep 
 is it a preposition 
 Verbs like in the cat sat down 
 Yeah 
 Who no 
 No 
 It 's not really a preposition 
 Sorry 
 It 's some kind of directional adverbial 
 Oh right 
 But uhm uh it doesn't allow for it 
 But that is in fact not a principal objection because clearly we 've only written very few rules so far and we could write lots more that would account for that 
 OK uh well maybe uh Colin will talk about language  
 Just take a specific issue here for a cognitive type  
 Uhm 
 Yeah it 's about uhm how genetically b bad based the development of language actually is  
 So that just before 
 does anyone have any  uh a priori  views on this  
 Here 's a problem 
 Human language  is it genetic  
  
 Bird song for instance  seems to be genetic 
 Uhm sparrows all sing the same way  
 What about human language 
 Well I mean surely we 're all born with a certain ability to be able to speak and so comprehend the sort of concept of language 
 but how it then develops is due to our own our environment 
 what happens to us  
 Uhm 
 Anyone else  
 Uhm 
 That sounds reasonable 
 Does anyone just 
 I mean in the in the population at large as it were before anyone studies psychology are there views on this matter 
 or I mean I don't know anyone  
 No overwhelming feelings that it must be learnt  
 I mean it is learnt right 
 Languages are learnt 
 It 's obvious isn't it  
 Isn't it 
 You know 
 I don't speak the same language as a French person 
 I 'm not born knowing English  
 Uhm languages are obviously learnt 
 so what 's the genetic thing if anything 
 What would you  
 what might it be  
 Well  if in humans there is a genetically encoded part of language uh you 'll have to find out ba to what extent uh language is genetically encoded 
 Whether we have say a passed down separate vocabulary which every human being which we 'd all actually know this vocabulary 
 or is it all completely learnt 
 Uhm right 
 There 's also other parts 
 Say uhm our language tends to be known as rich and specific 
 i e we have a l we have a very large vocabulary 
 Most people 's vocabulary is over fifteen thousand words and with this we can be absolutely specific 
 Using one sentence uh we can actually say an idea which everybody will know what we mean 
 It is very specific in our choice whereas say uh in another language one which couldn't form uh a good sentence you could say it but there 'd be uh ambiguity 
 People wouldn't know what we 're talking about to a very specific  degree  
 There seems to be much evidence though that language acq acquisition itself is genetically based as all children seem to go through the same stage of language acquisition 
 From about the age of one children speak uh a child will speak one or two words not actually in a sentence or anything like that just come out with random words  
 You know usually not the ones parents hope to hear 
 From about the age of two the child will speak two or three uh word sentences you know 
 They 've got a slight meaning behind them but you can't really say 
 It might sort of say Daddy bed meaning Daddy on bed or something like that 
 Uh you can actually see the idea behind it but you know they 're not using language very well 
 Then as they get older they get into grammatical sentences 
 and uh about the age of four most children can actually speak to virtually the same standard uh that a adult can speak 
 Thank you 
 any comments 
 That was what it said in the textbook 
 I 'm actually not too sure  
 That 's right 
 No  
 What about four-year-olds can speak to the same standard as adults 
 Uh uh 
 Well what you tend to find is if you speak to a five-year-old they can speak but like the content is very peculiar 
 They tend to make a lot more leaps and bounds  
 adults do and they don't really have the continuity they sort of 
 It 's mainly the content which differs rather than the actual language itself 
 and obviously their also their vocabulary is nowhere near as large as an adult adult 's  
 but uhm it seems to be that in the first two or three years of life they just intuitively grasp some of the uhm grammatical rules and knowledge uh of their native tongue 
 Do you mean that they 've got their grammar sorted by five years 
 Is that what you mean 
 Most of them have  
 Apparently 
 Apart from that they 're much better but uhm 
 I think what it means is uhm they can they know what language is 
 they know what they 're trying to do 
 It 's just the fact that they haven't learnt all the words they need to do it 
 It 's not just not only the words is it they haven't got the concepts either 
 Uh Is it is it Piaget who who who said about the different stage of development 
 You don't understand abstract concepts until you 're much older  
 so they can't express those properly 
 Uh uhm 
 Yes 
 Yes 
 Uhm 
 I should think that 's prob that 's true uh  uhm 
 So what are you saying is that the  that learning grammar is hard presumably 
 Not really 
 I It seems to be from uhm all the evidence that a child by the age of four has learnt most of his grammatical rules 
 It must be a specific part of the brain uhm completely devoted to learning language 
 If it is  say when we get older and uh we try and learn a language at school or something like that it takes us years to learn a language 
 and we 're never going to be able to speak it in the space of that a child can his native tongue two or three years 
 In two or three years of learning that language we 're never going to be able to speak it to the same standard we can speak our native tongue 
 and so it seems to be there must be some part of the brain which is specific uh to actually acquiring the native tongue 
 and there seems to be evidence as well 
 but I can't actually quote  my sources on this one 
 but there seems to be evidence as well that there is uhm space there for a second language 
 I suppose you could call it a space but and the ability to learn a second language  
 Uhm there seems to be also what 's known as the critical period for acquiring this language 
 Uhm as easy it is when you 're very young between the ages of one to four 
 and there 's an example used here 
 There 's this girl called Jeanie 
 and rather nastily she had been tied to a chair until she was fourteen by her blind mother and never actually given any form of uhm sound or language communication 
 Any time she made a sound when she was being feeding fed she was punished 
 and this girl was then taught language by various psychologists and uh well-meaning speech therapists 
 but she never did actually become a proper native speaker 
 Uh it was almost as if uhm she had tried to learn a second language and she was always very halting in her use of language  
 I mean we can never tell uhm 
 well not we 
 but they could never tell about how she would grasp concepts 
 Any comments on the use of a case like that as evidence  
 You don't know about her mental   
 Uhm 
 Yes so I mean like how would you know how she thought before then as well  
 I mean Also I mean people use language in social interaction 
 You don't just learn words and grammar 
 you learn how to uh behave more generally 
 You know what words are appropriate in what contexts 
 what sort of things should you say to people 
 and a child who 's had no interaction with other people  might simply have failed to learn I mean what communication is or interaction is and so might lose as it were the motivation for learning all these things  
 So uhm there 's always problems with uh cases drawn from  deprived childhoods in the case in the sense that they 're deprived of just about everything  
 We can't tell offhand what 's interacting with what 
 In In technical terms we say 
 we have no controls for all the different factors that are all confounded in that one  
 But there is one thing that you can seemingly draw uh from this case is that 
 there seems to be no innate vocabulary 
 If there was an innate genetically encoded vocabulary she surely must have been able to say a few things 
 If there was a basis that all human languages uhm are based upon and it 's genetically encoded it would seem that somebody like that should have uh just through the genetics an idea of vocabulary and some sort of vocabulary 
 but uhm in this case she seemed to have none 
 But that just totally discounts interactionism then 
 The interaction of genes with environment 
 That discounts it if you say that  
 Uhm 
 Are you saying that you need interactions to sort of  yeah to bring out this innate vocabulary  
 To bring out the genetics 
 Well if there was an innate vocabulary wouldn't you expect to go through all languages and find that they had the same words for things  
 All bastardizations anyway 
 Pardon 
 All bastardizations of the same word 
 All 
 Bastardizations 
 I don't know  
 I think he 's just made it up 
 Uhm 
 No right uhm 
 They sort of like they sound similar  
 But wouldn't you I mean you could just look at languages as one source of evidence 
 I 'm not asking you these questions about how do we know things and 
 In view of what you were saying about interaction could be true because another case I have is a group of deaf children and they 're not actually taught sign language but within this group of deaf children uhm they develop their own sign language called home language 
 And so I mean I just said you know Jean uhm this case of Jeanie so that there is obviously no innate language but then if there 's these deaf children they develop their own language maybe there is some idea  of it but maybe there 's just more that the idea you should be learning a language and if there is no vocabulary you start making it up 
 Uh in this case they started using elaborate pantomime at first and then it became more coded uhm  sign language and then how to do sentences 
 Uhm not really too many concepts but they could do simple sentences with it  
 It 's a sign language though 
 Uhm 
 It 's another form of communication 
 Uh so if if we 're to include sign language as evidence for genetic basis for language what 's the genetic basis 
 It 's not going to be just speech any more is it or 
 No it could be just re-routing because instead of hearing sounds they 're not able to hear sounds so what 's the point of speaking 
 You know they obviously use their eyes so they 're going to use their fingers for a start 
 But if the if the genetic uh con contribution was specifically for spoken language then it would just sort of have nothing to do 
 It wouldn't predict that they would sort of start using signs  
 So if that if this evidence more suggests that there 's an innate drive to communicate by making some sort of s sign which symbolizes the internal uh message and that well I don't know perhaps speech has some priority in the absence of it  people start using any other sign that they can make  
 Right we don't have much more time 
 We could uh clear up the cognitive thing 
 Uhm  the problem I really wanted to someone to talk about the use of twin studies but I don't think we 're going to  going to get them  
 Actually Melanie does don't you in your  thing 
 Yeah I 'd like someone to say something about twin studies so somebody that 's well Melanie you might briefly run through because there are Esther 's es Esther 's essay doesn't uh use twin studies three-or-four-words 
 It 's very important in terms of how it 's tested 
 The standard The standard methodology in behavioural genetics is the use of twin studies OK 
 So we need to sort of talk about that briefly  
 Uh Melanie 's essay is concerned with schizophrenia 
 Uhm 
 Yeah 
 Possibly 
 Yeah I was looking into genetic and environmental aspects and the major arguments for the genetic  hereditdit hereditit whatever the inheritableness of schizophrenia  uhm comes from twin and adoption studies 
 They found uhm two people in nineteen sixty-six that in identical twins which are genetically identical uhm there was a greater  concordance of schizophrenia than in the normal population a greater incidence  and 
 Do you know what concordance means anyone  
 Uhm it means that  
 If you don't know what someone means when you 're giving these talks you should say I don't know what that means would you please explain  
 Perfectly legitimate 
 It means that very commonly both were schizophrenics so that points to uhm there being a hereditary factor in in it and they even found that when the twins had been brought up separately so they haven't had the opportunity to learn from each other to learn the illness  
 Uhm in adoption studies  and 
 Do you actually quote any of the actual figures 
 Yeah uh I think so 
 Read it then  
 If you haven't got them I I think for  identical twins uh  I think I 'm right I think there 's about fifty per cent so that if you that means that if you have two identical twins right and one of them is schizophrenic there is a fifty per cent chance that the other  will be schizophrenic 
 Now the control in these things are normally fraternal twins 
 These are children born at the same time brought up in the same family and so treated you know much the same or at least you would assume so but who aren't genetically identical 
 OK  
 You see the rationale  for for this study 
 OK 
 We 'll interrupt it at that point to just do a quick statistical analysis of all your  your data shall we 
 So  let 's get a few uh ideas of what you made uhm reading number one 
 Anybody shout out that 's that 's got it 
 What did you make it 
 A hundred and eighty-six 
 Yeah 
 A hundred and eighty-six 
 And what about the diastole 
 A hundred and twenty-six 
 A hundred and twenty-six 
 Anybody make it lower than that 
 One seven eight 
 One seven eight 
 Anybody lower than one seven eight 
 One six eight 
 One six eight 
 One seventeen six  
 What 's the lowest 
 One six eight  
 So what about And what about anybody making it higher than that 
 One eight eight 
 One eight eight 
 Yeah 
 Anybody make it one ninety 
 One ninety anybody  
 One ninety 
 So one eight eight  
 So  there 's a difference there of twenty millimetres of mercury   
 Well we 'll go back to that later 
 What about the diastole 
 Anybody make it lower than a hundred and twenty-six  
 Must 've been somebody 
 Yeah 
 One two four 
 One two four 
 Don't be shy 
 You may be right 
 One two four 
 OK 
 What about higher than one twenty-six 
 One twenty-eight 
 One two eight 
 One two eight 
 Anybody 
 One three eight 
 One three eight 
 Wow   
  
   
 All right  
 Uh let 's take one or two 
 We do have to go forward 
 Uhm what about number three  
 What d' you make that one in the middle 
 Two O eight 
 Two O eight 
 Yeah 
 Two O eight one three two  
 Two O eight one three two  
 Anybody make it higher than two O eight 
 Two ten 
 Two ten 
 Yeah 
 Anything higher than two ten  
 You got another one 
 It 's definitely six 
 Two six 
 Two O six  
 Lower than that  
 No 
 Right 
 Two O six 
 Uhm what about 
 Anybody higher than one three two  
 One three eight 
 All right  
 Uh  what about lower than that  
 One thirty  
 Everybody made it one three two or above did they  
 OK  
 As you 're you 're getting used to it you 're getting better aren't you 
 You 're getting closer to each other 
  
   
 What about one one five 
 What did you make of that one 
 It went down 
 One sixty over ninety-six 
 One sixty ninety six 
 OK 
 What did 
 Anybody make it above one sixty  
 No 
 Anybody make it lower than one sixty 
 One five eight 
  
 One five eight 
 Yeah 
 Any lower than that 
 One five six  
 Oh lord that 's very close isn't it  
 One five eight 
 OK 
 Uhm ninety-six 
 Anybody get anything higher than that 
 Ninety-eight 
 It 's ninety-eight to a hundred  
 And uhm  
 Oh I don't know 
 Anybody lower than ninety-six   
 A hundred and ten    
 A hundred and ten  
 Is there  
 Can anybody make it lower than that ninety-six   
 Ninety-four 
 Ninety-four  
 Ninety-two 
   
 OK 
 Well 
  To do a  complex analysis of that uh later  
 Uhm so what are the factors that var what kind of variation are we looking at now then 
 What is this  
 What kind of variation is this  
 Ninety-two 
 Random observer variation 
 This is  observer variation 
 What kind of  
 Uhm between observer 
 Between observer 
 Mhm 
 That 's right 
 Between observer variation 
 As you 
 This is not like a real situation of course 
 You 're all You 're all seeing the same  uhm images on the screen and you 're all hearing the same sounds 
 At least hopefully you 're all hearing the same sounds and uh uh 
 So you haven't got any uhm subject variations involved here  
 This is all pure observer variation 
 Of what kind  
 It 's like every time they decide to open the valve to let the column down  there is a bleep  
 and about five times afterwards you think it 's probably   
 and it 's probably heartbeat   
 Yeah 
 A funny noise 
 Yeah 
 Yes 
 Yes 
 Well you aren't supposed to  record the systolic when you you can hear more than one sound occurring you know successively aren't you 
 You could have told us 
 No that 's what you 're supposed to  
  within yourself whether you still agree with your answers 
 Yes 
 Well we may be able to tell you that in a minute 
 Give us the answers 
 You 've been given the answers already 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 All right 
 OK 
 So you should therefore be able to work out your own uhm within person variability to a certain extent in terms of those pairs which are actually the same  the same uh person being recorded 
 How did you get on with that  within person variability  
 Terrible 
 Very well 
 Fairly well 
 Not very well 
 Well 
 Yes   
 OK 
 So this therefore illustrates both  within person variability and between person variability 
 Uh now he mentioned right at the end there digit preference  
 And uhm  the what this means is that if you take a lot of observers uh  and you ask them to measure  a series of blood pressures not necessarily all on the same person but on different patients 
 and you write them all down and you work out probably using a computer the frequency with which the last digits appear  say at a hundred that 's the last digit a hundred and two say at a hundred and four 
 a hundred and six and so on you 'll find when you 've got the histogram that the number zero is always usually more common than the other numbers 
 You get the frequency like that 
 Times two would be different 
 And why do you think that is 
 The line 's bigger 
 The line 's bigger 
 That 's a very good reason 
  the  board one twenty one thirty 
 Yeah 
 It 's the way the maybe the way the calibrations are are made 
 Uh so somebody who 's 
 When the When the column 's coming down it 's that 's a hundred 
 and uh that 's a hundred and two 
 that 's ninety-eight 
 when there 's a bit of doubt as to which of these three it should be it 's more likely the person would choose a hundred  
 People prefer numbers ending with zeros 
 And And for the reason you said it may be bigger on the scale and they home in on that one 
 So when you plot out a large number of readings you often can show digit preference  
 Now there is a way round that which is used for epidemiological surveys  
 Uh you don't use it in clinical practice 
 but you use special sphygmomanometers which have a what 's called random zero uhm device  
 The It means that the the zero level  is variable so that you get readings 
 But I mean it 's it 's preset beforehand by the by the observer but he doesn't know what it is  
 So it 's a random sort of offset anything between about nought and sometimes uh sixteen millimetres of mercury 
 So when he takes the readings he doesn't know where they should be because they 've all they 're all much higher than than he thinks should be 
 They 're they 've add You 've added on a a random extra number which you then substract at the end because he only finds out what it is at the end of the reading 
 That 's oft a method that 's often used in the big surveys of blood pressure reading 
 So But in clinical practice how can we reduce this variability 
 Frequency of blood pressure readings 
 Mm  
 What automatic reading 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Have any Have any of you seen those 
 Have any of you seen them   
 Yep 
 That 's a good idea 
  
 Too expensive 
 More than anything too expensive     
 And well another Well we 've already mentioned this already 
 Of course you  you get better repeatability the more readings you take 
 So I think from today 's session you 've realised I hope that you shouldn't start somebody on lifelong anti-hypertensive therapy based upon one single blood pressure measurement  
 True 
 I would certainly not advise to do that nowadays 
 The recommendations for treating mild mild to moderate hypertension always say that they the blood pressure  at such a level after repeat measurements over a considerable period of time sometimes as long as six months  because you 're starting someone on lifelong therapy which may have side effects 
 So you should never do that on the basis of one single measurement for the reasons we 've been discussing today  
 OK 
 What are the some of the factors which affect the blood pressure level in a in a patient 
 We 've al We 've already mentioned some of them  
 Let 's go through them fairly systematically  
 Well that 's uh that is the effect upon the observer 
 I 'm talking about the the subject variation 
 The operator is taking the blood pressure   
 Oh you mean their their effect on them 
 Yeah 
 Right 
 Stress  I mean sex-related  related 
 Right 
 Good 
 So the the so-called white coat hypertension is one example of that 
 So sorry about that 
 Uh  what  
 Whether the patients 're getting all uptight cos they have to wait outside the door  for a long time 
 Good 
 Other physiological factors which affect blood pressure 
  
 The temperature 
 The temperature of the room 
 The ambient temperature 
 What what Is it higher in the cold or lower 
 It 's higher in the cold 
 Yeah 
 That 's right 
 And lower in h hot ambient temperatures  
 Posture 
 Posture 
 Whether lying standing or sitting  
 What about other things they might 've got up to before they came into the  the room 
 Alcohol 
 They might 've run up the stairs 
 They might 've run up the stairs 
 They  might 've smoked a cigarette 
 Eaten a main meal 
  sorry 
 They what 
 Does the effect of eating have any  
 Eating 
 Possibly  
 Yes 
 Like a cup of coffee 
 Cup of coffee 
 Wine 
 And so  so all of these things can have an effect on blood pressure 
 And of course there are then the the actual physical uh characteristics of the sphygmomanometer which may have an effect 
 Can you think about that 
 The size of the cup you use 
 Size of the cup 
 That 's the important one 
 The  
 Right 
 When should you use a larger or smaller cup 
 Use a bigger cup in an obese person 
 Yeah  
 And a smaller one 
 On a child 
 Children 
 Yeah 
 There should be these In all uh  situations where you 're measuring blood pressure there should be uh several cups a standard cup width and then a bigger one for obese subjects 
 And it actually has it marked on the cup  
  
 Is that all right 
 OK 
 And of course ah uh external factors like you know the traffic noise and so on may also have effect on your ability to hear the sounds  and so on 
 So there are many factors which affect uhm measurement of blood pressure and in epidemiological studies of course we have to try to standardize all these things and try to equalise them out 
 But it 's random variation as we said before that will will tend to even out 
 We 've got to try and avoid systematic  biases between observers for instance 
 So therefore in these big surveys they train all the observers to measure blood pressure 
 They test them against each other or against films like this 
 And it that has to be done repeatedly throughout the survey if it 's going on a long time so that they can pick out people who are systematically  reading either high or low blood pressures 
 Uh so that 's another uh way of combatting that problem  
 OK 
 Well d' you think you know something about repeatability now 
 I think you surely do 
 If you were an economic historian uhm which none of us thankfully are  you would say what you have to explain here is the rise to dominance in the American economy of large business corporations or as they 're popularly but inaccurately called trusts  
 And most economic historians would say 
 the reason that these large business corporations got big was by efficiency that once you increase in size you can use your size as a weapon you can squeeze out your smaller competitors and the larger you get you can therefore make economies of scale 
 Therefore not only you can do what you are doing more cheaply 
 you can also pass on those savings to the consumer in the form of lower prices of whatever the product you actually sell actually is 
 That 's one view  
 The Tarbull view which is that of most muckrakers of the progressive era is basically that big business got big by cheating  
 Normally historians would say ninety per cent efficiency maybe ten per cent cheating 
 Tarbull says 
 ninety per cent cheating ten per cent efficiency 
 and there is one chapter in her book of nineteen chapters The jit Legitimate Greatness of the Standard Oil Company where she 's looking at all the things that are good that are organisationally finely tuned about Standard Oil 
 All right  
 Which approach would we buy  
 The view that it 's efficiency size economies of scale or the view that it is basically corruption that leads to bigness in the first place  
 Which side of the argument will we come down on 
 I think it 's difficult to take Tarbull at face value because she 's got a lot of personal bias because of her father  
 Yes 
 Her father was in the oil business in Pennsylvania at a time when it was expanding very rapidly 
 And all this stuff that uhm you were saying about the business of the uhm the young men life running joyously and ruddy etc and so on uhm is really a commentary on her fa on her father 's own generation 
 So when Tarbull thinks of business men driven out of business by Standard Oil she sees first of all her father 
 Her father is a man of incredible moral principle who will never do any work on a Sunday because it 's forbidden as he sees it in the Bible etc uhm 
 Exactly the sort of person that Rockefeller who also by the way of course is very religious but who he is going to trample underfoot and push out of the way 
 But I mean uh again a lot of people read that book as a panegyric to competition  
 Although I 'm not sure it is because if you look at Tarbull 's record in real life what she 's saying is the only way you can beat a powerfully organised business combination is by an equally powerful organisation of other business ties 
 In other words what Standard Oil does is organise the refiners 
 The only way of beating them is to actually organise the consumers 
 This is exactly what Rebecca at some point of her presentation was actually saying 
 Fine 
 So I can see th everything that Richard is saying here that Tarbull is biased 
 That doesn't necessarily mean that what she says is wrong 
 Which side of the argument do we come down on  
 Wouldn't it be somewhere in the middle because uhm 
 You sound like Spitting Image last night 
 I mean the climate was ripe for corruption 
 The The fact that uhm America does rise so fast uhm and had so uhm had not even  uhm thought about legality in that kind of area yet or or was just thinking of it 
 It was new 
 Wasn't that a climate that was ripe for corruption 
 Well what do you mean by corruption 
 Well for exploiting uhm you know uhm doing back-hander deals with the well-known companies 
 and es 
 Nothing was defined by law yet 
 so couldn't all these uhm little back-handers be going on all the time 
 Tarbull would disagree with that wouldn't she 
 She would say again as you were hinting in your presentation that the railroads are chartered by the State or if they 're transportmental by the federal government 
 They are basically common carriers 
 As common carriers they mustn't discriminate against various classes of their clientele 
 Yet along comes Standard Oil saying 
 OK we can guarantee say a thousand barrels of oil per day over this particular route 
 therefore we want either a rebate or a drawback or a kickback 
 What 's the difference between a rebate and a kickback stroke drawback  
 A rebate is what 
 Is it when they send the money back  
 Yes 
 But I mean in what sense 
 How I mean how how how do you define it in economic terms  
 After a length of time 
 Well when you get a tax rebate you get the money back after about a year don't you 
 Reduction 
 Yeah uh 
 Standard Oil got its money back a damn sight quicker than most tax rebates come through 
 Uhm but I mean why did he get the money back  
 Mm mm mm 
 Well cos it 's guaranteeing a certain amount of business for the railway 
 OK 
 Now isn't that normal commercial practice 
 You know if you put in a big order wouldn't you expect to get some kind of discount  except for the fact as Tarbull would say the railroads are common carriers 
 I mean they are obliged by their charters not to discriminate in this way 
 Uh uh th th that 's a very central point there  
 Uh what 's a kickback or a drawback  
 Mm 
 Mm 
 Well that 's got more sort of corrupt overtones hasn't it 
 Oh yes 
 Yes yes  
 Seems more i more more in terms of a lump sum gift  
 But a gift from who 
  
 It should be from who from whom from whom I think 
 From whom 
 From management 
 Management of what 
 
 Nah 
 No 
 Well it 'd be from the railroads 
 They 're being paid to  
 Actually no in fact 
 The railroads are being used because uh what a what a kickback or drawback is basically 
 I mean give an example OK 
 Supposing uh Standard Oil is shipping a barrel of oil on the route from I don't know Cleveland to New York  it gets a rebate of say fifteen cents per barrel all right 
 A kickback or drawback means for every fifteen cents a competitor of Standard Oil  pushes along that same route Standard Oil gets paid fifteen per cent 
 In effect Standard Oil is taxing through the mechanism of the railroads its competitors who for obvious reasons are almost never going to stay in business confronted with that kind of unfair competition 
 But it 's secret 
 that 's the basic point 
 They don't They don't know it 's going on 
 Of course I mean you you you you can't defend that in sort of any kind of public terms whatever right  
 So I mean again supposing we had been Rockefeller 's colleagues in the eighteen seventies  
 Supposing we want to create a large commercial monopoly for whatever reason we 'll come back to why in a few moments how would we do it 
 Railroad rebates is one answer 
 What else 
 What else would we do  
 It 's secret 
 We We would uhm incorporate producers on the financing  
 Uhm we would try and get an angle on every business  
 Yes we we we would take over people 
 All right 
 Now remember we 're doing this in the interests of efficiency 
 so we might for example uhm 
 There 's a technique called cutting to kill in which 
 I mean just to give you a sort of swift example supposing uhm you 've got a chain of gas stations a chain of petrol stations uhm and they have one independent competitor who sets up in business selling low petrol OK 
 What the chain does is sell even cheaper petrol to undercut this independent till he 's driven out of business or until he can be bought out by the main corporation 
 Hence cutting to kill 
 Now of course how do you buy them up 
 Sometimes you offer cash 
 Other times you say hey look 
 I mean there 's no point in competing 
 why don't you come in with us 
 You can become part of the South Improvement Company or later on you can become part of Standard Oil 
 We 'll give you stock in Standard Oil 
 You can even become a trustee of the company a member of the trust 
 All right 
 And then because of what you 've done uhm you know you 'll become wealthy 
 And look at the efficient marvellous commercial enterprise we 've produced 
 Now to Tarbull that 's wrong because you 're driving independents out of business  
 To Rockefeller it 's rational economic planning 
 So as long as you 've got unrestricted competition you 've got you tell me 
 None of us are economists but 
 Unrestricted economic competition leads to  
 What 's the main problem of oil producers and oil refiners in the first few your years of the oil industry in Pennsylvania  
 Incredibly fluctuating prices 
 I mean you very often have gluts that depress the price almost to the point where it 's not worth producing 
 What you 're trying to do 
 and this is this is against all the arguments of business efficiency 
 I mean OK business efficiency says size equals increased efficiency equals lower prices 
 What you 're trying to do in fact is get away from a low price situation in which really you can't afford to be in business 
 You do this by eliminating your competitors and moving if you can to a kind of monopoly type situation 
 Mean why do people want to become monopolies 
 I mean this is one of the big sort of uh criticisms of the Jacksonian period in the eighteen thirties and again in the progressive era in the eighteen nineties nineteen hundreds 
 Or they mean something different 
 The monopoly of the Jacksonian period is well you tell me created how  
 When Jackson talks about the Bank of the United States as a great monopoly in eighteen thirty-two  how is it a monopoly  
 Yes 
 It 's nationwide 
 It 's 
 Nationwide 
 Uh yes 
 Uh a good if somewhat unexpected point 
 Yes 
 What else 
 
 Yeah it 's chartered by the Government 
 I mean it 's chartered by by Congress all right 
 I mean the idea of a monopoly in Jacksonian times is something which is actually literally created and condoned by the Government 
 Now Jacksonianism is about breaking that up 
 I mean if there is such a thing as a Jacksonian democracy that 's what they 're trying to do 
 Now later on the monopolies are in a sense self-created by the uh monopolies like Rockefeller and Carnegie uh and so on and so forth 
 But why do they want to create a monopoly  
 
 Which 
 
 Well those are simple but not unappealing answers 
 Uh yes you get power and wealth out of it 
 but is that is that the only reason  
 You 've got complete business security 
 Ah now isn't that the key 
 I mean you look at business conditions in America in the eighteen seventies and the eighteen nineties 
 You look at the number of bankruptcies that happened every year  
 You look at the number of businessmen who go bust 
 I mean  some figures seem to show that one in every six businessmen have gone bankrupt at some stage or another  even worse than in Mrs Thatcher John Major 's Britain 
 Uhm it 's a period of profound insecurity in economic terms 
 Uhm security comes if you absolutely control all your industry 
 And that 's I think one of the basic kind of psychological motivations for most of the big trusts of this period 
 So I don't know if uh many of you came across this but there 's a very nice story in in Tarbull 's autobiography  
 Uh for the one and only time she actually went to see John D Rockefeller in person not not to talk to just to look at 
 And what happened was was she sneaked into the back of his church  
 He was always very diligent sort of immensely Christian gentleman as ever chiselled anybody out of five cents who taught his Sunday school class in Cleveland every week  
 And she went to his church and sat up upstairs whate what whate whatever they call it in church terms 
 I 'm not doing very well for this use of English here 
 But I mean in one of the sort of pulpits whatever upstairs 
 and she she waited for Rockefeller to appear 
 She was expecting to see a commanding sort of mogul type figure 
 and Rockefeller kind of wandered in looking very thin ascetic and nervous  
 and he sat with his back to the wall 
 And Tarbull said 
 he looked as if he was a man who was always on the lookout for enemies as if somebody was always trying to do him down 
 Of course again if you were John D Rockefeller somebody probably always was but that 's by the way 
 And I mean again the impression she got she was expecting massive self-assurance 
 What she got was massive insecurity 
 That was her impression 
 So actually what when we correlate what are we when we actually establish boundaries  what are we correlating  
 For example if you ever go to a to somewhere and choose a boundary for  a geological system  you either choose a boundary between the draft and application where would you go where would be a good place to go Jackie  
 What to find the actual boundary 
 Yes  
 You mean Wiltshire or something like that 
 Well uhm but where would you go in principle to try and get something you could correlate  
 You need a complete sequence 
 You need a complete sequence 
  yes 
 What sort of sequence 
 Uh conformable  
 Conformable 
 Yeah 
 And 
 With fossils in it 
 Deposited where  
 Uhm underwater 
 How far underwater 
 Shallow 
 Shallow 
 Shallow 
 Why shallow 
 To  fauna 
 three-or-four-words  
 You can tell from the fauna 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 You can tell what 
 Well best preservation  
 The fossils are there two-words-mumbled 
 Right 
 OK 
 Preservation 
 But isn't the shallow water situation one that 's likely to be more uhm changeable 
 Small changes in slea sea level might turn it into a sequence that has no deposition  
 Wouldn't it mean shallow  stable 
 Well what do you correlate 
 What is the best fossil to correlate with  in your  
 You know I 'm not just talking about one group but what sort of fossils are good for correlation  
 Give me some examples 
 Well  
 With a wide geographical range and well  easily preservable 
 Right 
   
 Yeah OK 
 For example  
 Ammonites 
 Ammonites 
 Ammonites or 
 Bivalves  
 Bivalves 
 Are they  as useful as ammonites 
 No 
 Right 
 They 're not quite as useful are they  
 What else  
 Palaeozoic 
 What do we correlate in the Palaeozoic 
 Uh with in the Palaeozoic we don't use ammonites cos there aren't any 
 Graptolites 
 Graptolites  
 Trilobites 
 Trilobites  
 OK 
 what have those  types of organisms got in common  
 Hard shell  
 Mmhm 
 Yeah 
 Uhm 
 Easily preservable 
 Well tho they 're  you see they 're very easy to preserve 
 But what about their distribution 
 Easily identifiable 
 Wide horizontal distribution 
 Yeah 
 Graptolites for example where do Graptolites  
 where do we find Graptolites 
 Black Forest shales 
 Yes 
 But deposited in what environment  
 Deep seas 
 Very deep water 
 Very deep water 
 or they appear to be deposited in uh well they they were deposited in environments that were preserved in relatively deep environs as are often ammonites aren't they 
 Ammonites are present ov in a lot of marine strata deposited at different conditions  
 So  we 're looking for sequences i in which we 've got a marine  a fairly complete marine record aren't we  
 And we would choose a marine sequence rather than a non-marine sequence  other things being equal  
 Right 
 So uhm  what happens then when we get to boundaries between different uh systems  for example at the end of the Silurian 
 What do we get in this country in the Silurian 
 What sort of rocks do we find in the Silurian  
 Mm 
 Mm 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Shales and  
 Uh yes 
 What sort of shales though  
 Uhm  
 Black 
 Black shales 
 I can't remember 
 Uhm South Wales 
 What about South Wales Silurian  
 Jackie  
 It 's a sort of very muddy 
 and  you know 
 Uh   
 David  
  
 If you go up towards Aberystwyth you get this thing called Aberystwyth  grits which are what  
 Grits 
 Yeah 
 Sandy 
 They are sandy but what 
 y You haven't seen them but you can actually just think about them 
 They 're turbidites 
 Mm mm 
 Oh right  
 But as you come southwards towards South Wales you get into a shale sequence  don't you 
 Mm 
 Mm mm 
 You get all these things like Wenlock limestone and all these uh uh shallow water local  which have become so important in correlation  
 Uhm the Devonian though 
 What is the Devonian in Britain  
 Mm 
 Old red sandstones 
 Old red sandstones 
 What do you think of as typical Devonian 
 Which is what  
  
 Uhm continental  
 Continental  yeah 
 So 
 And there 's marine deposits as well 
 So between the Silurian and the Devonian is  what  
 Bone beds 
 Big  
 There are the bone beds but what happened  at the end of the Silurian  
 Large mountain belts 
   
 Exactly 
 There 's a mountain building up a major orogenic eve event  
 Now if we were actually looking at the stratigraphic column then we would actually s recognise there was a difference between the rocks that come before and the rocks that come afterwards in terms of their  age and appearance and character and so on and we would say that perhaps is a fairly important break 
 Now how important is that break the Devonian-Silurian boundary  on an 
 Like the Caledonian  
 It is the Caledonian originally  
 And how important is it on a worldwide scale 
 Mm 
 Well very important 
 Very important  
 You couldn't 
 Across the North Atlantic anyway 
 Certainly across the North Atlantic 
 So it 's a fairly important event isn't it 
 Mmhm  
 Uhm  and uh  should it be should it be expected to be applicable to  China  or Australia  
 No 
 Not necessarily  
 So what would we expect to see in those areas  
 A complete sequence break 
 OK 
 So in other words  is th k is the stratigraphy that we have established in Britain because the Devonian comes from  where 
 Devon 
 Devon 
 Would do wouldn't it really 
 And the Silurian comes from uh Wales 
 Uhm why should the stratigraphic divisions that we 've established in Britain be of use in Australia  or  China 
 From Wales 
 There are certain elements of them are going to be aren't there 
 Why 
 Because we have got this worldwide correlation in some parts 
 Mm 
 The bone beds are worldwide aren't they  
 You know there 's a broad division between one and the other  
 I don't know 
 I 'm not absolutely sure about that  
 Well I think so 
 But why should uhm 
 What you 're saying is that we 've established a purely local stratigraphy which such as you 've established in your own areas in your mapping projects for example 
 but yet it appears that by accident it has some global significance  
 I think that 's just the fashion or fact that stratigraphy originated here 
 Is it 
 Mm mm 
 So in fact   the world 
 In o In other words you 're going to you would argue that perhaps  uhm  the stratigraphic column may not have been correctly divided up  
 Yeah 
 Mm  
 So are there any correct parts of it that we could agree on 
  
 The end of  
 Why 's that  
 Because it 's marked by a mass extinction 
 Mm 
 OK 
 Which is worldwide  
 Bit difficult to correlate mass extinction I think  
 Bit sort of negative rather than positive 
 Rather than correlation themes because you 're looking for their absence which is uh somewhat tricky because if they 're not there you don't know what it means  
 Uh what else  
 Which other bits do you think cope fundamentally  
 Mm 
 The Cambrian  
 The Cambrian 
 Cambrian what wh 
 Most of it 
 All Just the Cambrian in general is significant 
 Yeah I mean 
 Why 
 Well a at that time we thought the land was all s sort of slapped together 
 so therefore all the sort of deposits that are are there are going to be worldwide aren't they  
 You got You got uhm Archaean shields all over the world haven't you 
 Yes  yeah  
 Well haven't I have I not just answered your question or what 
 What do you want me to say 
 Well you 've said that the Arch You 've mentioned that we 've got Archaean shields that we 've got Cambrian  strata around the world but so what is what 's 
 why is that a fundamental division  
 Well because it can be correlated worldwide 
 What can be correlated  
 All the Archaean sediments  
 Uh  I 'm not sure that 's true really 
 I mean uh  what 's so important about the 
 There is an int uh something interesting about the Cambrian that might lead us to believe that there is uh  something of significance there globally  
 No 
 Is it the uhm the appearance of more complex life forms 
 Uh  certainly they are more complex 
 But what 's the characteristic of pre-Cambrian strata as opposed to ca post-pre-Cambrian strata 
 Pre-Cambrian are igneous rocks  predominantly  
 The Palaeozoic 's more marked by sediments  
 Well that 's what they use for dating anyway 
 Well I don't know 
 I think that may be an impression you get simply possibly because you 're seeing deeper levels of erosion in very old rocks 
 But I mean if you can go to South Africa and Australia and Canada and find uh pre-Cambrian flint stones these cherts and things like this which have got apparently some little faunal elements in them  
 And you 've seen the torredonian 
 What 's the torredonian 
 What sort of rocks are they 
 Are they igneous 
  
 Well OK but I mean the the ones that they normally use to date 
 I don't know 
 In the book I read they 're not 
 But 
 Right but what 
 It said they normally date uh in the pre-Cambrian 
 They date using the igneous rock 
 Right but why do they date radio-metrically in other words 
 Cos there 's no fossils 
 three-or-four-words 
 No fossils 
 Exactly because there are no preserved fossils  
 So there is a fairly fundamental division between the pre-Cambrian and the post-pre-Cambrian  in that all of the Palaeozoic strata have got fossils in them or generally they 've got fossils in them and in the era before they didn't 
 And there 's 
 But you pointed out something about the nature of the fossils that are preserved in Cambria  which is that they are  
 Yeah 
 Mm 
 More complex 
 Yeah they 're 
 They 're very complex organisms aren't they 
 I mean the first things that we find 
 If you read uhm  There 's a new book by uhm Steven J Gould on the  shale which is quite interesting and the photographs and reconstructions although the the text is not all that enlightening I didn't think 
 And he 's they 're describing uhm  the  shale fauna and pointing out how exotic they were 
 And there were these weird organisms that are well preserved 
 Mm 
 Mm 
 Mm 
 Got sort of five legs and eyes coming out of their 
 Mm 
 Yeah exactly 
 All these things that are no longer didn't appear not to have continued in evolutionary terms 
 Uh  and  they suddenly appear in the records at that time and they were obviously sophisticated organisms  
 Uhm  
 so there was something happened at that boundary which is of significance although we don't know what it is 
 What others have we got  
 We 've got two now  
 Uhm Permian to Triassic  
 Permian and Triassic  
 Uh do you know anything particularly that happens at that interval 
 No I can't see why that 's such a big boundary 
 Not really 
 Mm 
 Well they 've got primitive plants and animals to more modern forms 
 At the Permian-Triassic boundary 
 Mm 
 Uh so th 
 So it 's flowering plants mammals and birds  
 So in other words if you were to divide up the stratigraphic column today you would get  four  main divisions would it be  
 Mmhm 
 Just uh makes stratigraphy a lot easier anyway doesn't it  
 But uh might not tell us a great deal about the Earth 's history 
 Well let 's concentrate on some of those and see why some of those are so significant 
 What does anyone say on the Cretaceous cos that 's probably one you know more about in the sense of  more information around on this one recently  
 What 's happened at the end of the Cretaceous  
 David  
 Well you have a mass extinction 
 We have a mass extinction 
 OK 
 First of all I think  relying on lecture notes alone is not enough for for any work you 're going to hand in  
 Where  could you go to find out more material 
 How could you go about it 
 I mean I 've said this question to all of you  
 There now you 've got to find out about the question of geology in London  of London in fact  
 How do you find out more material about this  given that  could start helping you and   
 There are loads of stuff on London in the uhm architecture room 
 How do you find out  
 Libertas 
 What would you What would you type into Libertas 
 The geology of London 
  And when you 
 And you got 
 I  down the  
 On London there 's five thousand items eight thousand on geology 
 One item closely matches your theme 
 Exactly 
 Only it 's not quite  
 I know 
 There are certain things Libertas is useful at 
 But unfortunately when you get a very big topic like Geology or London it really isn't very effective at sort of narrowing things down 
 The key words aren't very good in fact cos all the students taking out the titles everything with the word London in the title is going to go 
 What else could you do  
 Try the  
 Try the local provenance 
 Such as 
 Outer London 
  
 Yeah 
 And quite often the local libraries are actually better equipped because they 're providing a more general uhm sort of  you know supply  
 What else 
 Anybody got any other ideas 
   
 On  Monday morning get that brain going  
 Geology in London  
 Do you need your caffeine fix before you  this  
 No ideas at all though 
 Frank 
 Emma 
 Uhm  there 's a museum in   
 Does the Geographical Museum have any books or anything 
 What 's the Geographical Museum 
 The Geological Museum 
 Sorry 
 It 's just beside the uhm Science Museum 
 You can buy geological maps from there 
 In fact the hydrogeological map of south-east England would be quite a nice starting-point  
 Have you heard of The Times Atlas the one that they 've just come out with that 's got some very nice diagrams 
 I mean it 's got a summary page there wholly on the geology of the south-east England 
 It 's not very hot in the essay 
 It 's all diagrams but it 's very good to conceptualize uhm the structure  
 Well you 've missed the most obvious one 
 I mean who do you go to 
 Who gave the lectures on this  
 So why don't you knock on his door   
 You 've You 've tried libraries 
 You 've tried Libertas 
 You know you you 've gone on the shelves 
 I mean the the simplest I mean usually the best starting-point is to go to the lecturer  who has actually taught about this topic and say can you advise me 
 Can you point me in the right direction 
 One thing 's for sure is that if that lecturer turns round and says no there 's nothing much written on that one all right at least you know that 
 I mean there isn't 
 You know you you 're not going to be sort of uh  rushing around looking for non-existent material 
 What happens is if there 's a lot of material you need to look into the geological memoirs and so forth but  
 So  you go and have a word with Ron and probably John French as well I suspect  
 Emma do you know do you know when his office hours are 
  
 They 're on the door 
 Uhm there are certain  hours  
 OK 
 And 
 You should give us an idea of how you 're going to tackle that 
 And what what are going to be your your main  arguments 
 Well 
 I explained  briefly what  really is 
 Why 
 Uhm it 's not because and uhm 
 and which   
 its uhm industries  uhm  
 Uh  there are some countries where uhm   
 What have you got there 
 A thousand words  
 I mean there are there could be books over there on global warming certainly a hundred thousand plus 
 How 're you going to get this down 
 How are you going to How are you going to say anything sensible in a thousand words 
 Mm 
  international so uh  uh law    if there is something done about it 
 otherwise some countries will do something  in some way 
 I 'm not de denying that you you you 've got ideas about it 
 but what I 'm really trying to do is see whether we can focus down 
  
 What  the answer oh global warming  
 What what what are the topics that come to mind 
 do you know 
 The ocean level line 
 Mhm 
 Uhm growing season 
  agriculture  to agriculture 
 So you 're going to the actual impacts of facts 
 What it means to me or 
 What are the grounds of that  
 You Duncan 
 Uhm  perhaps one of these years I suppose is h how much uh 
 how much is is uh global warming actually occurring and how to how does one how does one measure it 
 Mhm 
  
 You can actually break it down into into different uhm  different aspects of global warming and different causes as as you perceive them 
 I mean the destruction of rain forests uhm  and things like that  
  wide-ranging  
  OK 
 So So you 're you 're really interested in the in the scientific side of it  
 I 'm not 
 No 
 I 'm not really interested in that  
 I 'm interested in   uh 
 Mhm 
 Is that what it would what it would  bring to mind or where your interest would lie if you had to go and do something about it yourself 
 No 
 I think mine would be the implications for for the individual countries  
 Mhm 
  
 Impacts you mean 
 Yeah 
 And you 
 Yeah 
 The impact 's first the thing that springs to mind first 
 Mhm 
 I 'd try and pursue how much how much do we actually know  
 Do you think you can do the impact before you know what the causes are  
 Do you think we could actually discuss that  
 What What are the impacts 
 What  
 If you  
 I mean you 're you 're going to save almost five years I 'm sure through your A-level this this whole part of it 
 What What What are the impacts going to be   
 Sure 
 But do you do you have do you have a sort of a you know a feel for what  
 There 's  under water 
  That obviously rooted  
  
 Well how how much is that 
 Is that is that uh two centimetres 
 Twenty metres  
 That 's about a metre rise 
 Is that Is that the feeling people have who talk about it an or an order of a metre rise of water 
 More than that 
 Less than that  
 Something like that 
 Yes 
 About a metre 
 I don't know  
 No  
 I remember someone saying to you Alec  that sea level rise is one thing  
 Quite possibly 
  
 By how much 
  
 It doesn't actually have to rise that much 
 Isn't going to make a lot of difference 
 No  
 No 
 Not at all 
 I wouldn't agree 
  
 Icecap water  
 And then what about the actual amount of temperature rise 
 I mean how much how much has it risen over the last hundred years 
 I should think about two degrees  
 Is there any any advance or any reduction in two degrees 
 It had fallen 
 Four degrees  
 It had fallen 
 Fallen 
 Yes 
 Over the last a guess 
 Well it fell between nineteen thirty and nineteen seventy 
  
 Here we go  
 So there 's been a reduction of that time as well 
 But simply if I took a starting-point as eighteen eighty and the end point as nineteen eighty  what would be the difference between the temperatures in those two dates 
 We 're talking about you know a ten degree rise a point and a half degree rise a one degree rise  
 Any advance on that  
 In fact  it fell by about point four but rose overall by about one degree 
 It has risen of that order of magnitude 
 The forecast rise in sea-level was twenty centimetres  
 and the forecast rise in temperatures one point four degrees from now 
  
 Has this definitely been decided or is this just pure speculation 
 What 's the difference  
 Is there any 
 I don't know actually  if there is 
 Whe When does it change 
 What 's the difference between a speculation and a definite statement 
 Speculation depends on the present the present trends 
 No 
  
 There 's no such thing as a definite statement  
  as you can when you measure temperature 
 ARK has The organisation ARK has said that sea-level will rise by one metre  if present pollution levels and conditions continue  
 There 's a definitive  statement 
 OK 
 I say it will rise by two metres 
 Uhm  
 But the Government of the U K in its nineteen ninety-one report has said twenty centimetres sea-level rise and one point four degrees centigrade increase 
 So if you like that is the definitive statement for the time being  
 So if you go to the library  the report nineteen ninety-one looking at the impacts uhm on the basis of that  
 Emma what are you going to write about   
 Uhm  not individual countries but basically areas   
 So a spatial variation of of change  
 Uhm  yeah 
 Uhm well that 's the thing  
 Uhm  
 Yeah 
 I mean the point is you you can't write about impacts scientifically date likely scenarios  in a thousand words 
 It 'll just be a mishmash of a few points here and there 
 I think you need to focus now  on one aspect  whether it 's impacts whether it 's just temperature whether it 's rainfall 
 I I would not suggest you go for the spatial one because that 's the most contentious of all 
 I mean all areas in in Hertfordshire change compared to north-west Scotland 
 Uhm their resolution models just got greener  
 No 
 I meant I meant Europe 
 I mean 
 Well they 've only really done simulations of five regions in the world 
 They haven't done The temperature they 've done for the whole world 
 but for temperature of upper Asian soil moisture there 's only been five selected regions of the  changes done 
 So I don't think you 'll have a I think you 'd be you 'd find it very difficult to be honest 
 Can you specialise if if there 's a very big wide topic can you specialise into one thing in the in the essay title 
 Yeah 
 The point is you can do what you like  
 I 'm negotiating with you the title so that you 're choosing a title that I think you can produce coherently a thousand words 
 It 's because although you 'll be marked on style and presentation if it 's incoherent you don't get to the starting-point 
 If there 's no references if it 's not produced with some material of a of an academic nature then uhm that 's not good enough 
 So you can't put down drivel and just present it so that it 's all paginated nicely and you 've got nice margins or spacings and so forth and all the tab settings are right if it 's complete garbage  
 And I I just feel that 
 Emma 's  
 taking a topic there 's a lot in there 
 So I 'll I 'm going to urge you to try and focus down on a particular aspect whether it 's  carbon dioxide and and ignore C F Cs for instance 
 You could just choose the impact of the ozone layer 
 You could just look at rain forest 
 but don't try 
 and put all of those in 
 Is that what is required by the examiners 
 Yeah  
 Exactly 
 No 
 Well that is this is the problem is that many of these exam questions on international problems are so huge that you can only tackle them by narrowing down the scope 
 But in the exam question you 'd expect to do fifteen hundred to two thousand 
 Of course you are concerned with a sort of notion of of uhm representativeness too aren't you so that the arm is exactly there  and that the  figure is positioned in exactly that kind of way in space  
 and it is you know of a human being whereas David 's is  you know 
 by the colours you use you are also saying you know 
 I 'm not concerned with with uh a natural representation of the head 
 aren't you  
 Both of you are doing something  completely different 
 So then what are you interested in David  because this is 
 Yes what do you paint  
 I mean clearly everything you paint is a representation of something  you know and yet at the same time you say uh 
 Forgive me 
 Uhm I 'm sorry to kick this thing out of the way 
 Sorry  
 By giving Patricia a grey skin  and and the yellow and the green in the face etc you 're saying this is not about  her real appearance  
 No I think 
 What is it about representation that you 're interested in 
 I think it 's the structure 
 The structure  
 And it 's the  creations 
 You couldn't cover very well for  cos you would argue I suppose  Miriam that you 're interested in a structure as well would you  
 Yeah I I 'm quite interested in uhm trying to carve a figure by using paint uhm  so that you get a uhm a feeling of uhm a body being very solid 
 To paint an illusion uh of the three dimensional  
 I mean it 's the same old problem with two dimensions  communicating two-dimensional objects  
 It 's that kind of space that you 're interested in is it  
 Yeah 
 Uhm I don't want to give an illusion 
 I I I want to try uhm  try and uhm just carve use use the use the paintbrush and carve out the figure and see what the end result is but I don't want to try and portray an illusion 
 I 'm just I 'm just happy with what uhm what the carving achieves  
 Sorry 
 Why don't you use a  
 If you want to carve why don't you why don't you just carve it  with carving tools and   
 Uhm 
 I I find a challenge trying to   
 I mean it 's not really carving 
 I think you can 
 You 're not carving it out of the paint  
 Uh uh I think uhm  you can be you can use paint as a way of uhm  very similar to African sculpture  
 I mean I don't achieve it here 
 but I think it is possible to achieve it 
 For example which painters are you talking about 
 Picasso his uhm 
 his masks are very very carved and he uses paint  
 Uhm he does 
 he has this   one of three women at a window 
 and uhm I think it 's 
 There 's one holding a curtain back and the faces are very carved in that  and he uses paint  
 I think that Miriam brought up an interesting point when she talked about tribal art or kind of primitive  uh notions of representation  which I think is  something that 's more applicable to David who 's because he 's you know approximated the notion of the head 
 He 's developed a sort of a you know a language 
 I mean each one of them looks as if they 've been run over by a steam roller 
 There 's a a a Renaissance painter whose pictures look as if they 've all been steam rolled and I can't think of who it is 
  do you know 
  
 Somebody whose heads always always look flattened off 
 Who am I thinking of 
  
 Yes  yes 
 They look as if they 've all had a quick turn under the steam roller  uh and yours have that same quality in that you 've made up your decisions which  are  you know stylized 
 Patricia 's head can represent all heads  cos you know they 're almost a general voice for heads  
 Is that what you 're talking about when you talk about structure whereas for Miriam it 's quite specific 
 I mean there are occasions within the  painting  
 Do you see what I mean Matthew 
 Maybe it 's tribalist 
 David 's can be regarded as a  gesture whereas Miriam doesn't rely on light 
 Light  
 And so I 'd say that Miriam 's is a night painting whereas David 's is a substance painting 
  
 No 
 see 
 I don't agree cos I think that  everybody has the same picture plane on the first side and then  particular side of the picture plane that is imposed on David 's painting  
 No not at all 
 And uhm using the painting until you can see light 
 No I mean look look 
 David compositionally tells the whole  when he distorts the head in order so it will fit in 
 Squashes it 
 He 's making all sorts of decisions within this rectangle about the head which he believes important cos you know picture plane and colour and gesture etc he 's 
 he 's you know 
 There 's much 
 Maybe that 's to fit the canvas anyway 
 Yeah it 's an intimate thing isn't it 
 We 're almost You know forgive me Patricia 
 we 're almost close up to you 
 You know I feel I know you intimately whereas with with uh Miriam 's you know there is a distance you know 
 It 's iconoclastic kind of painting  
 It 's not meant to be close contact or intimate  
 It 's about distance and space  
 The distance you know 
 We 're away from it  in an academic sense 
 So why why then would you see    pictures been steamrolled whereas I see  as somebody who uhm paints something in simplistic terms  a specific  Rembrandt is just time and space  
 This idea of paint 
 He paints 
 Oh I agree with you then 
 I don't disagree  
 I agree 
 So on that point you 'd say that Miriam 's pictures have far more representativeness than  
 No no no 
 I just think that the way   's heads come out because of that they look more like David 's 
 You know they look  as if as if as if their space has been stretched whereas Miriam 's is is you know a fairly representational you know seeable kind of space 
 There 's very little distortion in the space  
 Now I don't know why  did what he did uh 
 but frankly it was a sort of  wouldn't he 
 It was useful  
 But you know that 's very very 
 Makes you think about it 
 You mention that 
 but if you a technical word the word substance 
 Substance 
 Yes 
 And I think that actually I hope  will talk to you about that although  the name  
 But uhm I thought what was striking about David 's paintings is the physical tactile substance the way he uses the paint  
 He 's very generous with the paint very strong physical person 
 and uhm  
 and uh uhm use a bit more  
 Uhm the way I sort of painted this picture is uhm I 'm very keen to to get uhm luminosity the light shining through and uhm have the background uhm and the figure almost sort of reacting with one another so the figure stands out and shocks you 
 And the way I 'm going about doing it is uhm I use a lot of turps and rub  rub the colour in into into the grey areas so I suppose that 's one of the reasons why it appears so luminous 
 Do you feel it worked 
 Uhm well I feel that uhm I do sometimes use thick paint but uhm I feel that you can kill the canvas and it 's very difficult to bring back this luminosity to it 
 It depends if the colours are uhm are dirty or not but uhm  
 Would it be   
 Yeah 
 How long have you been working on your green painting there 
 Uhm for about five weeks six weeks 
 You see there 's a danger with your painting the way you do in my opinion in that one could be sort of astounded by its virtuosity 
 Oh I wish people 'd stop saying that about David  
 and uhm it 's not that good anyway 
 If I can continue   
 That one could be astounded by your virtuosity and then  ending up with nothing else  
 I 'm interested in the structure that you 're interested in 
 I mean one thing I would sort of ask you Miriam is this  
 I don't know if I 'm how you agree with this but it seems to me that  you assemble the figure  over six weeks twelve weeks or whatever  
 At a certain point the painting goes through uhm a sort of  stage two when you find you can pull the thing together  
  in that picture  or the other one you had downstairs  and that one 
 Now is I mean is this so or not  
 Do you intend to assemble all the bits  and then at some point draw round the thing as a whole or find some simplified 
 No I 'm not actually aware of suddenly one day it all comes right 
 I just kind of uhm 
 but I do I do ignore a lot of problems 
 and say I want to fix this and get this right 
 and then I 'll go to this 
 so I I I know that uhm I haven't even started the uhm head at the moment 
 It 's very flat 
 and there 's a lot of things I 'm ignoring cos I want to get the structure of her bottom and her legs seated first of all  
 and then I I I 'm not aware of all the problems coming together one day and suddenly it works cos it doesn't  
 but uhm  I just ignore a lot of things until   
 Mmm 
 Is it pleasure that makes you paint 
 Yeah although I do some paintings and I don't enjoy doing them but generally I continue painting if I 'm enjoying it 
 Mhm 
 It depends because you like to paint 
 Do you paint because you like painting 
 Yeah I mean  
 In that small painting there are some very nice passages aren't there 
 This neck is is uh almost sharp  
 the way it detracts from the form it 's almost like a 
 Here 
 Lovely form here  
 I mean I would say this about both of you and I 'd say it about myself as well actually but I think you 're bad on colour  
 Yeah I mean I think that uhm particularly in Miriam 's case 
 I mean you you cannot but see that in the context of Cezanne  
 Cezanne would have found colour for the figure and the background and everything else and not such a sort of tonal uhm device that you 've used  
 I mean it 's the same thing with David 's 
 I mean even though you 've sort of  very arbitrary about  a background colour 
 You started off with the cream colour for the skin 
 Course you work it in on the grey and you sort of you 're drawing with the paint  
  marvellous work  
 I think  in both ways you 're quite similar 
 and I think  colour to be uhm 
 What do you reckon 
 I really hate the word background paintings like this cos they 're paintings not   
 and they should work as flatness 
 and uhm t just I know it sounds 
 but uhm you should be thought of as just as one thing not as foreground and background 
 How do you  
 No just me 
 but mos everyone most people say that to them 
 I just think maybe uhm sensation 
 I mean from what David said about colours uhm  in David 's painting it would be  the sensation from the tip of the nose to the lips to the cheekbone  to the grey background behind the hair 
 Which painting are you talking about 
 This one Wo 
 Works as a passage 
 Which one 
 the middle one 
 This the one next to the brown  with the yellow dress 
 Works as a passage but you actually have to uhm  spend time and just sit 
 You have to look at it to sort of see that  
 And so on on those grounds I 'd say that those colour values in terms of being a painting  aren't fully realised 
 but  there is a sort of acute sensibility about the way they 've been put down  whereas I do believe that I that that eyebrow is the most fluid sort of eyebrow  sort of a one stroke which says more about the pocket of the eye  than it does about probably the r the whole of the rest of the painting  
 What the top left one 
 Yeah it 's the top of the left eyebrow yes 
 In David 's 
 Yes And the neck is very good as well  
 That 's a very sharp line 
 uhm we will first talk about what would happen if you cut a peripheral nerve 
 what would be the  effects of that 
 Would there be loss of sensory information which would happen in the example before us 
 Numb 
 Numbness 
 That 's right of course 
 Numbness in the region of the cut  that the area that the cut nerve innervates would be numb 
 And what else 
 uhm  well  you you wouldn't have any of the innervation over here so  so you you you would get loss of emotion loss of motion 
 Loss of movement 
 That 's right 
 Loss of movement 
 Movement in that area of course 
 Yeah  that 's fine 
 And one last thing I want to ask you is do you have any idea of what would be the effect on the actual muscle itself 
 If you  If you took a piece of the muscle and if you sliced it up and looked at it under a microscope and that muscle has been  denervated in other words the nerve has been cut 
 It would just be  would be relaxed 
 It would be relaxed 
 That 's exactly right 
 And And what would it actually look like  
 Just what will the cells look like 
 Do you have any idea 
 They 'd be swollen up 
 Swollen up 
 Not swollen 
 but they 'd be  atrophied 
 The other way around 
 Atrophied 
 Yes 
 You were right they 'd be changed but they 'd be atrophied 
 They would be actually smaller and and a bit shrunken  
 Yes 
 And what would actually happen with the  muscle tone 
 Muscle tone would be relaxed 
 Is that temporary or is does that 
 Right 
 So does everybody understand why it would be relaxed 
 You understand why it can't  mo why you can't move it 
 You understand that all of you 
  the reason 
 What is it that normally provides 
 Can you sit down 
 Yes 
 Yes  
 What normally provides the muscle  tone  
 They I was going to say that they that they that they something to do with the vagus nerve 
 Not really because vagus doesn't go to to the uh striated muscle 
 What goes to the spine then  
 Yes 
 But uh just thinking in terms of sort of coming out of here 
 Do you know what what what what what it is that provides 
 Do you all understand what tone is 
 It 's a 
 It 's a slight  It 's a slight uhm resistance 
 So that it isn't just a flaccid kind of floppy  piece like like this rag 
 If If you pick up uh uhm liv I mean muscle that 's uhm living muscle it 's got resists a pull 
 All right 
 But if it 's just floppy like at the butcher 's shop it doesn't 
 it 's like a rag 
 It 's lost its tone 
 OK 
 Now the tone is provided by the gamma motor neurons 
 Does anybody remember what the gamma motor neurons do what they innervate  
  
 The The spindles don't they 
 That 's right 
 So the spindles are sitting in  in the muscle aren't they and they 're innervated by gamma motor neurons 
 And those gamma motor neurons have got what 's called a tonic firing 
 They 're firing all the time and they 're making the spindles contract  a bit and uhm  
 What 's the effect of that  
 What happens if you change the spindle lengths  
 Uh the 
 The alpha motor neurons 
 And why do the alpha motor neurons   change 
 What What gives them information 
 Because there are thousands of the   
 That 's right 
 That 's exactly what you should call what 
 Can you remember what they 're called  
 One afferent 
 One A afferent 
 Lovely 
 That 's exactly right 
 So one A afferents which innervate the uhm which innervate the spindle are sensory afferents called one A afferents  
 OK  
 Will then feed on to the alpha motor neuron  and that will cause the muscle to be slightly contracted all the time 
 These gamma motor neurons are firing in a tonic sort of way all the time on to the muscle spindle 
 and they 're  that 's feeding back  one A afferents and causing the uhm alpha motor neuron to  slightly 
 So in other words your muscles all the time are in a slight state of contraction 
 So when this nerve is cut not only will you be numb in the area not only will the relevant muscles not be able to move 
 but the muscle will be all floppy through lack of tone 
 And it will also as you said slightly atrophy 
 Now what do I mean by atrophy 
  it degenerates 
 Not specifically degenerates 
 It 's like the first thing it 's like it 's on its way to degenerate 
 but degenerating implies that they 're actually dying 
 uhm the cells don't actually die but the the the muscle cells become smaller and shrunken  
 OK 
 And you would actually see it 
 uhm anybody who had any nerve damage uhm you 'd actually have muscles 
 Actually I don't know if any of you ever had damaged a nerve but it 's noticeable that the muscle which was innervated becomes uhm what people think of in layman 's terms as wasted  
 But it 's 
 Mm  
 I I 've I 've had that 
 You 've had  
 So it is   
 OK 
 So what happened then after a while 
 It didn't last forever I hope 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 No I had 
 I had a month  
 Right 
 And then in time what happened was as you quite rightly say  this nerve degenerates as a result of the fact that it 's been cut off from its cell bodies 
 But in time it grows again  
 And as it grows back so the sensation reappears  so the movement reappears  tone is recovered in the muscle and uhm  and the atrophy goes 
 The The The muscle begins to   
 It 's helped by doing uhm some exercise to bring it back into its normal 
 Would the nerve actually regenerate itself 
 The nerve regenerates 
 That 's exactly right 
 It grows from the cut end across back to the tissue again 
 Now if if the uhm if when you cut a nerve and you look at the target of that nerve and in this case we 're talking about muscle and that target appears to  become uh to die slightly I mean not actually die but become wasted what what does that tell you about the interaction between nerves and their targets 
 uh  
 Yes 
 N G F is a good 
 You 're sort of jumping a bit ahead 
 I mean what does it actually tell you about 
 So if if when you cut a nerve the target which innervates that nerve  begins to show changes coming back it should 've become weaker and smaller what does it tell you about the normal function of the nerve on that target 
 Well apart from stimulating it it has a role as those blood vessels carry uhm blood or other things 
 So it has an essential role in its its survival then 
 Right 
 Exactly 
 And how would you how would you express it 
 What d' you kind of role do you think that is 
 That 's right 
 It 's doing something more than just exciting the muscle and making it contract isn't it 
 It 's needed for the normal maintenance and health of the muscle 
 Do you know what word is used to mean that something is life-giving or supportive in its function 
 Growth factor 
 Growth factors come into this but there 's a ge general word which is called trophic 
 Trophic 
 Oh yes 
 OK 
 So nerves have a trophic action on muscles 
 They don't simply just make muscles work  they actually keep the muscle healthy 
 And therefore in the absence of the nerve the muscle becomes weaker  and  there 're actually metabolic changes in the muscle 
 Its ability to to grow and utilise glucose and do all the things that healthy cells do change in the absence of a nerve 
 So So you mean that it 's the nerves that feed them 
 Nerves feed them 
 Exactly 
 That 's exactly right 
 There 's some kind of feeding process that goes on 
 Now we don't exactly know what that feeding process is 
 uhm we really don't 
 And it 's a two-way process because in fact the muscle is providing the stimulus to the nerve 
 So we 've got the nerve is having a kind of trophic action on muscle but ma muscle actually also a a a acts in a trophic way towards the nerve 
 But let 's just stick with the nerve affecting the muscle for the moment 
 We don't We just simply don't know what that effect is 
 All we know is that nerves do have a particularly important role uh o on the maintenance of their targets 
 It 's more important in some tissues than in others  
 A good example of where it 's absolutely essential is in the taste buds of the tongue which 're renewed all the time  
 but if your tongue is denervated if the nerve to your tongue is cut then the taste buds  are stopped being renewed all the time 
 So there 's a sort of very very very definite thing that you can measure there 
 Whereas in other tissues like let 's say skin denervated skin is in fact tends to be uhm a little bit thinner and slightly more sort of shiny in appearance 
 but it 's it 's not a lot different from innervated skin 
 So some some target tissues uhm it 's it 's more apparent than others  
 If a nerve A question 
 if a nerve doesn't regenerate  what happens to the muscle eventually 
 Does it atrophy 
 Oh but it does regenerate 
 I mean nothing could stop it regenerating unless unless uhm in an experimental situation you actually actively stopped it by say tying a great big knot in it or something 
 But I mean in a normal situation it would 
 If if if If in an experimental situation you did try and not allow it to regenerate then interestingly enough the nerve would atrophy sorry the muscle would atrophy to a certain point and no further 
 So there 's it 's not a total dependence on the nerve 
 it 's a partial dependence  
 OK 
 Now I said that there also 
 Sorry did somebody else want to ask something 
 What does the degener the regeneration depend on 
 Right 
 Exactly 
 So you were asking about N G F 
 Now there 's also an interaction the other way round so that this regeneration that I was telling you about where the cut nerve grows back uhm is dependent on again trophic factors coming from the target 
 And a very important trophic factor is called N G F or nerve growth factor  
 A nerve growth factor is released particularly from denervated target tissues and encourages  the nerve to grow 
 The nerve grows much more effectively in the presence of  growth factor  
  
 Yes 
 From the actual target tissue which in this particular case we 're talking about is muscle but it could be any target tissue which is denervated 
 It 's released by it and then to to help it to grow back to that source  
 Right  
 So  let 's move back a step then or or back towards the central nervous system and think 
 now what would be the effect uhm if we uhm keep the nerve intact but we cut uhm a dorsal root  
 And uhm Marilyn  could you please answer that 
 All right 
 Hmm 
 Could you tell me please 
 what would happen if uh  if if if if you cut the dorsal root 
  
 Right 
 Good  
 uhm so what would that mean 
  the output 
 Isn't that right  
 Why could you not have any motor output 
 I mean  if if if it was present  
   interact 
 Right  
 You 've got no sensory input 
 You answered that quite right  
 So that means that the skin  yes  could have an area of now let 's see 
 The muscle would no longer be changing its one A afferent input in would it 
 So what would that have 
 What effect do you think that would have 
 Any questions about what we 've been doing so far cos that 's a natural break 
 The Uhm the  
 you did yesterday 
 How How did that lump feel cos it was it was deep 
 It was so deep that most of these characteristics you couldn't  you couldn't accurately define  
 Uh I got the impression looking back at it now I got the impression that it was a small lump  which had no particular shape and which was firm  
 It wasn't attached to skin  
 it did not seem to be attached to uhm  or external   
 and there were a-few-words-muttered 
 She had a history as you know of having had an attempt to remove the lump previously and they found that it was very  to the nerve  
 This was because they hadn't been allowed to do a proper operation 
 You remember she had insisted that they only do a small incision under local anaesthetic 
 Of course they should never have done it 
 They shouldn't have a-few-words-muttered 
 and uh 
 so as you saw we really ought to get it out  uh  deeper because  it was few-syllables the nerve 
 It was a deep lump  
 but uh what was the whole principle of the operation meant to be 
 and one which I don't  entirely subscribe to in the end  
 To get the lump out alone or  
 To get the lump out alone 
 Uh I might have been very bad in my explanation 
 No it was saving the facial  
 Pardon 
 It was saving the facial nerve and also uhm removing the tract where the previous operat operation  uhm 
 That 's true yes 
 I remember I mentioned that you had to remove  the incision which had been used previously  because it had to be assumed to be contaminated with a tumour 
 The reason why I said it had been contaminated with a tumour was that in the previous operations which part of the tumour had been removed 
 And the whole point of the operation that we were doing was to try to get the widest possible margin of normal tissue all round  because  while so-called benign parotid tumours are benign in the sense that they do not appear  to want to spread by the bloodstream   glands  they have this nasty tendency to  to the wound  
 The cells are broken off   
 so I wasn't able to do as good an operation as I would have wished  on that lady  
 but I did the best possible without destroying her facial nerve as you could see  the facial nerve 
 There 's no question 
 And if I had sacrificed the facial nerve I mean in the normal way without a previous first operation I would have sacrificed those two branches of the facial nerve that were very tightly apposed to the lump  
 But my reasoning was as follows 
 She has already had tumour disseminating from the previous operation almost certainly  
 so  to sacrifice the facial nerve now  and risk dissemination now would probably make no difference to recurrences in the long term  
 and she will have failed to have a bit longer of uhm uh uh normal facial nerve function  normal in relation to the muscles muscles of facial  
 So that was my reasoning 
 but don't get thinking that that 's the right sort of operation 
 It wasn't 
 Normally I like to I like to never see the lump  
 I don't want to see the lump  
 I musn't see the lump 
 All I see is the normal tissue all round it  and the management of a lump in the parotid region  because you can't do this preliminary biopsy business  is to cut the lump out  with the widest possible margin of normal tissue  
 The preservation of the facial nerve  provided the circumstances of the operation permit by which I mean provided  the lump isn't growing into the nerve  
 It 's difficult  but you will decide  
 But did she have general swelling of the gland  no 
 It was just a tumour in the gland  
 What was the reason for not  wanting the general the first time 
 Was it just the scars or 
 On that lady 
 Oh she 's as mad as a hatter 
 Oh well 
 I mean she she answers yes to everything 
 Have you taken a history 
 No no I 'm sorry 
 Oh go and take a history  
 Go on 
 Do yourself good 
 Go 
 and take a history  because she 'll answer yes to every question you ask her  
 Oh yes she has  
 she has  
 she has  
 She can't lie flat 
 Oh yes 
 She had the anaesthetists so worried they didn't want to give her the anaesthetic  until we  reassured her 
 We showed her a letter in the in the notes 
 You see as far as she 's concerned she has the most terrible reactions to anaesthesia 
 She can't have anaesthetics  
 but we had a letter from a consultant anaesthetist in the other hospital to say she 's perfectly able to have anaesthetics 
 That reassured our anaesthetists here  
 They nearly said they weren't going to op let me operate on her 
 As you know she had the anaesthetic without  turning a hair  
 There was a point in your lecture you gave us  uhm on a lump in the parotid region  
 You mentioned that any lump should be excised  
 Would you refer  uhm that to a palpable lump rather than just a  swelling 
 Oh yes 
 You see  as I explained there on that diagram  if you get  a swelling of the whole gland  it can't be a tumour  because you can't visualize a tumour growing differentially in different directions so as to reproduce the shape of the gland  
 So what sort of lesions do you have  
 Well constructive lesions  stone in the gut  ascending infection  all producing a swelling in the whole gland   
 Syndrome  
 Have you heard of  Syndrome 
 Yes 
 Now  Syndrome produces 
 Well we don't know the nature of the disease but it certainly produces attacks of ascending infection  and it in any case produces a hardening of the glands and indeed if it doesn't swell it becomes palpable  
 So those are not necessarily any of them indications for removing the parotid  but you get a lump in the parotid and then it 's ninety-five per cent liable to be a parotid tumour  and therefore it must be removed because although ninety-five per cent of them are benign  five per cent are not spreading by the lymph nodes   
 You don't know  whether it 's one of those or whether it 's one of the five per cent that are malignant  so you 've got to remove it 
 You can't find out by a preliminary biopsy because you only spread it around if it is malign and hence make a an eminently curable neoplasm incurable  
 And so you 've got to  normal tissue 
 So that was the reason for my advice for a lump in the parotid region as distinct from a swelling of the whole gland  
 So a tumour could never cause swelling  
 Could a tumour not cause obstruction and hence swelling 
 I 've heard of a tumour causing uh uh swelling by obstructing the main parotid duct  
 All I can say is I 've never seen it myself 
 It must be very very rare 
 Stone yes  tumour no  
 Sounds like if those tumours aren't very radiosensitive then  or very chemosensitive 
 Not at all  not at all 
 In fact  there 's evidence that all uhm X-rays due to so-called benign parotid tumours just make it more likely to go malignant 
 You know there is a tendency for malignant change anyway  and one of the reasons for removing a benign parotid tumour is that it may go malignant  in twenty years ' time or so  
 Of course also it 's fair to say that as it grows if it 's growing slowly all the time it 's making the operation for saving the facial nerve technically more difficult  
 Why is it not radiosensitive 
 Why is it not radiosensitive  
 Science cannot answer the question why 
 Never can it 
 It can only answer the question how  
 Now the how is that tumours which grow slowly are less radiosensitive than tumours that grow rapidly  
 so the benign tumours or the more benign tumours tend to be radioresistant 
 and the more malignant tumours tend to be radiosensitive  
 But why  
 Well you need a philosopher there  
 you know it 's a great mistake to think that science can tell you why something happens  
 Yeah 
 Right 
 Mmm 
 I 'd have thought it being in such an easily accessible site under the surface and so close to the surface you could do something locally  some sort of local treatment 
 but there 's nothing at all you can do  into the the region of the tumour  
 Nothing at all to 
 Well that 's what I 've said about  the tumour 
 You just spread it around  
 You wait 
 On this firm I guarantee in five six weeks you will see three patients in out-patients who 've been sent up to me having had an inadequate operation for a lump elsewhere 
 and I 'll  
 Usually it 's a multiple recurrence and then it becomes much more difficult to save the facial nerves 
 You can't save the facial nerves 
 And all the time the patient is in more and more risk of  developing cancer  
 Yes  you might think you could 
 but the fact is in our present state of knowledge you can't  
 and unfortunately there are a lot of surgeons around  who don't realise that and who fiddle around with local operations and things like that putting needles into the  and so forth 
 That 's all very well isn't it when you 've got  cases where you haven't got to worry about  what you 're going to leave 
 but when you get things like breast change obviously the cosmetic side comes into it more 
 Uh uh when you get things like what sorry 
 Well if you get uh say uh a  of the breast then it 's obviously more difficult cos you 've got the consideration to take 
 You can't be so radical can you in your approach 
 Well 
 Well well I mean that is the modern trend as you know to do lumpectomy and major therapy for  of the breast 
 but  a friend of mine called Professor George up in uh Glasgow has recently done a study  in which he 's analysed  uh the psychological disturbances and so on produced in women with  of the breast  comparing two groups one in which a mastectomy was performed and another in which lumpectomy was performed  
 What do you think I 'm going to tell you 
 You 're going to say that the the people who had the mastectomy probably had a better prognosis than the ones that had the lumpectomy 
 Not prognosis 
 No they 're happier with it aren't they 
 They were happiest  
 They were happy  and the answer is you see people have always assumed that  women are confirmed are concerned about the deformity produced by a mastectomy  
 Now there are several answers to that 
 One is that they may be more concerned in fact about what how good a chance of cure they 've got  
 Do you see what I mean  
 I mean you speak to most doctors for  of the breast  
 and they 'll say 
 well you know let 's have it in the bucket  the sooner the better  
 And the other is that deformity  of a partial removal  uh a lump on the breast can be considerably more difficult to disguise  than a mastectomy 
 Mmm 
 Right 
 The prosthesis that you can wear if you 've got  
 You can't have a prosthesis  that 's worth its weight of gold worth its weight at all with a deformed breast  but with the breast removed you can have a beautiful prosthesis  
 No no 
 Mmm mmm 
 So it 's it 's 
 I mean I think that you 'll find that although the pendulum at the moment has swung completely over to the side  of uh local treatment for cancer of the breast I think you 're going to find that that 's a tendency which will come back again 
 Mmm  
 But that opinion though is one is one that 's been brought by patients that 've had the operation 
 If you ask them before they go into the theatre do they want a total  mastectomy or a lumpectomy they 'll probably say 
 a lumpectomy 
  people who 've had the operation rather than before  
 so they 've got 
 you know you 've got a sort of retrospective view rather than one that 's looking forward  which is probably I think 
 Yes 
 Right 
 Where are shares traded  
 At the Stock Exchange 
 The Stock Exchange 
 The Stock Exchange 
 It controls the trading of shares in public companies 
 and if you break the rules 
 I mentioned You remember I mentioned that the panel consists of representatives of The Bank of England the banks The old Stock Exchange and other financial institutions  
 So the Stock Exchange will suspend trading in your shares  if you break the rules on a takeover  
 If a bank plays fast and loose with the rules  
 What do you think will happen  in a takeover if the bank  does naughty things like funding secret purchases of shares  
 Same thing 
 You get struck off the Stock Exchange 
 Well banks don't require  trading in their shares  but banks do require something in order to practise in order to be a bank 
  
  
 No not  
 A licence 
 A licence 
 They require a licence 
 If the City Panel  on Takeovers  rules that a bank has broken the the code  financial rules 
 Where does the licence come from  
 I think from the Department of   
 It 's actually The Department of Trade and Industry 
 The Secretary of Trade and Industry will act on the recommendation of the City panel 
 This is extraordinary 
 Here 's a private body  u upon whose advice the minister acts to remove a statutory licence  
 Makes a definition of government   difficult to say the least when you see private bodies exercising public regulatory power governmental power 
 So the definition of government is is is not an easy one 
 What we are trying to get you to realise is that defining government as parliament or the legislature  the executive in the form of government departments and civil servants in the ministries is a in modern corporatives in Britain is a very difficult  thing to do to say that that 's all that government comprises 
 We have to look rather more widely  in terms of the constitution of what constitutes government or what the constitution regulates  
 What are the most powerful organisations  in our political system  
 Have a guess  
 The pressure groups 
 I am thinking of  three or four particular pressure groups  particularly trade unions 
 The E M A 
 Sorry 
 E M A 
 Again that 's like a a trade union only a professional organisation 
 But getting back to the political to the directly political  
  
 No we 're not involved in in that side of politics  
  parties 
  parties 
 Parties 
 Political parties  
 Surely our constitution ought to include  political parties  
 We are asking about 
 They 're not government  but they play a very influ influential role  
 It 's interesting that our legislation nowhere in legislation will you find a political party mentioned 
 They don't exist  As far as 
 As far as legislation is concerned they don't exist  
 What role do they play in in in our constitution 
 And where are they mentioned  
 When we talked about rules and legal rules  I wanted to expand your idea of what constitutes the the rules or the  the things which govern constitutional behaviour 
 Where will you find the parties mentioned  
 In the legislation of the electoral system 
 No 
 They 're not mentioned in the legislation at all 
  
 If the Government starts  
 Well there there is reference to the the leader of Her Majesty 's opposition to one of the salaries uhm legislation but it doesn't refer to a party 
 It just says  the leader of the legislatives ' loyal opposition 
 It doesn't mention a political party 
 Is the  the same as the Queen 
 and should  
 Well that 's that 's a convention that 's a convention about the non-withholding of royal assent 
 Yes 
 Although the Queen technically in law has the right to withhold  convention says that she doesn't 
 And no monarch since Queen Anne in nineteen seventeen O two has disobeyed that convention 
 But  you were you suggesting that parties could be found in in constitutional conventions  
 Yeah  
 Uhm where 
 Can you Can you give an illustration of where a party  matters in in constitutional convention 
  saying to John Major that he can't go into one of the the houses party  
 conventions ruling that the actual head of the Conservative Party  in power 
 Uhm there are conventions that stop him from doing so  
 Well those are conventions about being Prime Minister 
 Yeah 
 How is the Prime Minister selected  
 Through 
 Through his party 
 Through his party   
 Labour Party 
 The trade unions 
 Membership I mean membership of the Labour Party  
 Pro pro  
 The lead 
 Elections 
 Well the leader of the party is elected by the political party  whatever the definition of the constituency of that political party is is uhm 
 It differs from party to party 
 In the  Labour party it 's now a an electoral college comprising the  uhm  trade unions parliamentary Labour Party and the constituency Labour Party 
 In the Tory Party it 's only the parliamentary Labour Party 
 Members of the Tory Party in their constituencies have no say whatsoever nor does big business who pays 
 Uhm only the parliamentary  uh party has a say in the election of the leader 
 In the Liberal Party it 's it 's one member one vote 
 And every single member of the sorry Liberal Democrat  Party 
 every single member has has a right to to vote in the election of the leadership 
 So each party has its own different rules for election of its leader 
 But how does this relate to the choice of Prime Minister  
 Through election 
 Sorry 
 Is there election 
 Well  
 How do we choose our Prime Minister 
 We have an election and and what 
 By electing the party the head of the party becomes becomes Prime Minister  automatically  
 No 
 But how is the Queen required to 
 The Queen has to  call somebody into Buckingham Palace and say 
 please form a government 
 The amount of seats 
 The amount of seats 
 Yes 
 The amount of seats what 
 Gained by taking the party who has the higher majority in the House 
 Whoever has the majority of seats that party will form Government 
 And the head of that party forms the Government becomes the Prime Minister 
 The The official convention is actually that the person who can command the support of the majority of members of the House of Commons is entitled to become Prime Minister and form a government will be asked to become Prime Minister and form a government 
 But in practice as a consequence of parties ' uhm electing in one way or another their leaders uh there are arguments now that the convention has become that the leader of the party  commanding the support of the majority in the House of Commons shall be asked to form a government 
 The problem with that of course is that parties may not have a majority  
 But when you really do start going back to the person who commands the majority 
 Also given the way that some of the members some of the leaders are elected 
 Couldn't happen with the Tories because quite clearly a Tory party leader would have the support certainly the party leader would have the support of the members of the parliamentary party because that 's their electoral process  
 But the Labour Party  the parliamentary Labour Party only has twenty-five percent of the vote in selecting  the leader of thirty-three percent  
 It could very well be therefore that the leader of the Labour Party while he commanded the support of the trade unions and the the constituency party would not have the support of the parliamentary Labour Party 
 and even if the Labour Party won an election and had a majority of seats in the House that particular party leader wouldn't have the support of the parliamentary Labour Party and therefore wouldn't command the majority of the House of Commons  
 It could happen  
 Several articles in Public Law over the recent years uh  would suggest that as a consequence of that system we might well have a leader of the Labour Party who would not  uh be able to be asked  to kiss hands as they say uh  
 I don't see why it couldn't happen to the Tory party 
 Isn't that That 's not what happened last year when Margaret Thatcher was dethroned   
 Yes  
 But the new leader had the support of the parliamentary Tory Party the parliamentary Conservative Party  
 So therefore he was once he was elected leader he would automatically be asked to be uh Prime Minister by the Queen 
 Uhm whereas the Queen might be faced with a situation at some future stage where because of ructions within the Labour Party uhm a disagreement between the trade unions and the National Executive over  uhm industrial policy for example 
 The the The Labour Party refuses to repeal all the Tory or the trade union laws 
 Uhm the National Executive the the parliamentary executive refuses to change those laws and the trade unions say right we 're not going to support you 
 And they elect somebody else  as the leader of the party who doesn't command the support of the parliamentary party 
 Could happen 
 So the covention clearly is now going to involve parties 
 That 's the first time that parties 've actually become involved in the constitution  officially involved uhm through convention  
 So even if we try to say that the constitution is that body of of rules we discovered that it 's not just rules it 's  
 it 's systems electoral systems within parties  institutions and the way those institutions there are run and governed internally 
 It involves private bodies 
 Government can involve private bodies exercising public power 
 That 's the relevance of   
 It is very important to distinguish between public and private power as well as public and private institutions public law and  
 Those institutions have the exercise of public power even by private bodies  
 Now we 've said so far that it consists of the constitution consists of rules  
 What stops a Prime Minister  or government  from  passing discriminatory legislation  
 What What stops a government for example from disenfranchising Catholics or Jews or blacks 
 Well the law  
 Well the Parliament is supreme 
 It can't be the law 
 We don't have a constitution which stops  government from legislating certain things 
 We don't have a constitution which says 
 Congress shall pass no law restricting the freedom of press 
 or Congress shall pass no law uhm discriminating against religions  
 That 's the First Amendment 
 Considerations I mean 
 Consideration 
 Consideration for 
 What sort of 
 Consideration for the uh the idea that  the public  wouldn't really  appreciate that kind of legislation 
 It might cause an outcry or something 
 Cos the House of Lords couldn't stop it  and the Queen could only stop it in  a very extreme case 
 You know 
 Are you serious 
 Yeah I am serious 
 If the uhm If the Government was to do something like that people would stop it other people  
 In an ideal democratic society if the Government was to propose a a an action like it  of some sort it 's the people who would let their uh the elected members of parliament know and the elected members of parliament would vote that way in the House of Commons 
 So it should be the parliamentary members that stop the Government 
 All right 
 uhm I was reading your paper but I want to read it again  properly 
 Uh but I 've got a few questions  mostly relating to lexical phonology that might be uhm 
 I 've done lots of bitty things this week 
 nothing sort of very exciting 
 Sure 
 Yes 
 That 's fine 
 That 's fine 
 There are weeks when bitty things are the most productive  
 And there are weeks when you can get stuck down you can get down down to earth 
 Mm 
 Yeah  
 Well that that 's good 
 Well you get used to that 
 It 's a new way of working for you 
 You can't anticipate because you 'd find it  slightly odd at first 
 It is 
 Yeah 
 Mm 
 Yeah 
 It 's nice because you can fit it to how you feel you know 
 But I I really like that because I like working late  
 And uh  I in fact I 've taken to working 
 sort of I do an hour before I get up   because if I do an hour before I get up  I then have feel I 've already started and I feel very positive and I can slip back into it 
 But if I haven't done anything I find it really difficult to sit down so    
 And I tend to do bits late morning and then work late  late much later 
 Not too much in the afternoon  
 Uhm  but I I have an intention of doing a hell of a lot more from now on and and doing  
 Mhm 
 Mhm 
 Mm 
 Do you 
 Seems very reasonable 
 Fair enough 
 Mm 
 You 'll find it much easier when the place is emptied at Christmas 
 And at this weekend that happens everybody 's furious 
 It 's bizarre  
 And you won't notice it so much except in college  because in the department a lot of people are graduates anyway so y you know once you 've seen a face  
 I mean in college it 'll be funny  
 Very nice though  
 Yeah yeah 
 Mm  
 Yeah   
 Yeah 
 Mm  
 Yes  
 Yeah  
 Mm 
 Uhm  uh  as I was wondering about simple   
 I know and uh 
  
 Yeah  
 I mean I haven't got any  
 I was wondering about simple as well like for about the last eight years or so 
 Yes  
 Well I don't think language is simple 
 so that 's that one out of the window 
  peculiar 
 And with Lass I mean Lass nineteen ninety the acceptation thing put in uhm  Journal of Linguistics where he says that languages are just sort of cobbled together 
 They 're bits of old things left over and cobbled together 
 They are not perfect and they are not predictable  
 Uhm and yet well that sounds about right to me 
 Mm 
 Mm 
 Mm 
 I used to really think that uhm  languages did have to be simple 
 I mean I don't think that you should go the whole hog  and try and come up with the most complex linguistic theory that you can conceivably come up with full of sort of knobbles and accretions because it strikes me that language isn't like that either 
 There are irregularities  
 And you 've got to recognise the things that are regular and things that are completely irregular and suppletive 
 But there is a difficult set of things in the middle that are neither  
 And that 's where I have trouble and I think that 's where  has trouble  where you want to capture relationships but only between a few items for instance  
 I mean as for you it 's easier since Warren name set up a rule  
 Mm 
 And if we write anything that doesn't fit in directly 
 Uhm  it 's equally easy in a non-declarative model 
 you just set up everything and rely on it in a sense 
 Uhm  but it isn't so easy in a model like this where you 're trying to peer down on the  and stuff we have 
 But there 's things in the middle oh I don't know like uhm  some strong verbs for instance that you might want to say are not outrageously different from one another 
 but it 's not rule-governed 
 I mean in a queer way you 've got to have some notion of morpho-lexical rules or something like that  
 But that hasn't been worked out yet  
 Mm 
 Mm 
 Mm 
 Mm 
 Mm 
 Mm 
 Mm 
 Yes 
 Mm 
 Mm 
 I know 
 Mm 
 I 've written something only I 'm not sure I agree with it any more   
 Uhm   the only word which we can consider simple valid  the term simple valid is by asking  is by  assuming I think simple refers to the universality of the statement 
 Mm 
  
 Mhm 
 That 's one way of interpreting it 
 Another way is of interpreting it is to see it in terms of what speakers do or what languages do  by which I mean uhm how speakers learn or how they process about which we know a limited amount  or uhm how languages change  
 Uhm  so universality is one of several possible interpretations assuming we 've grown out of counting features which I hope to God we have by now  
 But I think that we haven't in the sense that we have just classification still  because Anna Name seems to me to be counting features 
 You know that 's what  really means to her the same as it meant to Chomsky and Halle  
 So anyway  
 If you want to answer on simple come back in you know forty years or so  
 Mm 
 Mm 
 Mm  
 Mm 
 Mm 
 We have 
 Yes 
 Yes 
 Mm  
 Yeah  
 Yes 
 Yes  
 Yeah 
 I 'll do that  
 So do you think the answer is to def define it for one 's own purpose and go and use that 
 What frightens me also is defining it for your own purpose because obviously I 'm going to define it in a different way 
 Right 
 Yeah 
 But as long as that 's all right because you know what you 're doing you wrote in a given  paper or something like that  
 Yeah  
 I mean by simple in that paper I mean coherence with external evidence  
 And by external evidence I mean what speakers do and what languages do  across time and synchronically  
 Uhm  and I don't mean  simple counting simple manipulation  
 But normally you can see that that 's fudging  
 Mm 
 And you can   which is why it scares me to death 
 Mm 
 Mm 
 Mm 
 Probably is fudged isn't it 
 so 
 Mm  
 You know well that was that one   
 Sorry 
 It It 's a bit awkward if you 're that unconstructive in that sort of thing   
 Uhm  oh yes 
 Oh that was a comment that you  went on to talk about anyway so 
 Oh good 
 As long as I go on to talk about it 
 There are several of those   
 Uhm 
 Perhaps my mind works in a rather unstructured way 
 No 
 It seems seems to work  
 Uhm I mean I 'm not saying I 've got the same ideas as as you  the same good ideas as you 
 But uh what what I mean is that that all the things I thought of you then went on to answer  
 so uhm  without sounding as if I 'm grovelling or anything 
 Sure 
  
 Good 
 No 
 Nonsense  
 I mean I do that all the time when I 'm marking people 's essays 
 And it gets it may get  maybe irritated after a while 
 They say 
 well why didn't you read it through first  
 But you can't 
 You know you can't do it all the time 
 Mm 
 Yeah yeah 
  
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 This was a first read so 
 Uhm  oh yes languages that are similar  
 Yes 
 Right 
 You answered that one  
 That 's the rest 
 Now there was something else though uhm on the lexical phonology bit uhm  which I 'm just starting to read 
 I 'm I 'm reading those two  uhm  but I haven't got anything to say  
 Sure 
 Good 
 Bearing in mind that there are actually two competing theories to some extent which is Mohan and uh 
 Actually I mean this sounds again like  pushing my own stuff  but I wonder if it would help if I gave you my thesis  
 Right 
 Yeah 
 Mhm 
 I should think so 
 Mm 
 Uhm  I mean it isn't necessar not all of it is going to be useful to you  
 And I would pick around it to some extent  
 But uhm  when are you going away 
 Mm 
 Mhm 
 Uhm  well Professor Greenbaum has got chicken pox so  I 'm not going to his party because it 's cancelled 
 So uhm  that I 'm not going on 
 I was going Sunday night you see but I 'm I 'm not anymore 
 I 'm going Tuesday uhm  because there 's the U C L Linguistics Society  uhm  Christmas dinner to which one 's in invot invited as an honorary member   
 Uhm so that 's then 
 And then I 'm coming back Sunday  
 Uhm  I  I 'm going to do  couple of days ' work in the Survey and come back Sunday and see and see if 
 In fact I 'm cat-sitting on Yeah I forgot that I 'm cat-sitting Friday night and Saturday night  so I 'm coming back Sunday  because my parents are coming to collect my sister  so I 'll come back with them 
 And then I 'm going to be here for another week until just before Christmas  so I thought that was the best way to do it 
 What 
 Yeah 
 That 's right 
 Mhm 
 Oh good 
 Oh my God 
 Yeah 
 Mhm 
  
 Oh 
 Right 
 Mhm 
 Right 
 So supposing when you come back on Sunday or say the Monday or something supposing you come in and get the thesis  would you feel able to have at least a look at it in that week and then give it back to me 
 I get paranoid about it 
 You see it 's like a baby 
 You know it just sits there on the shelf uh 
 I don't like to give it away for too long 
 It 's stupid isn't it  
 And it 's all on the computer   
 Goodness knows it took me long enough to actually think about handing it in in the first place 
 Mhm 
 Right 
 Yes 
 I 'd like to 
 Yeah 
 No 
 I don't blame you  
 Not really no 
  Is it 
 Is it bound like a book 
 It 's there 
 That black thing 
 Oh on the shelf 
 Mm 
   
 It 's a bit huge 
 This is the problem 
 But there will be bits of it that you don't want to know  about 
 Uhm  but there is just 
 All I 'm thinking about really at the moment is there 's an introductory chapter which talks about all the different versions of lexical phonology there are  and talks about what we might prefer and for what reason  
 And there 's about seventy pages of that  
 And that might be an ideal 
 Mm 
 Yeah 
 Right 
 That would fit in nicely  yeah with this  
 Well it it helps you with Mohanan because Mohanan and his circ Kiparski and Mohanan diverging wildly and on some things like morphological representations and that and it might just help you approach some  
 And the rest of it you can ignore largely because you 've got the papers that are now up to date versions of it 
 And a lot of it 's very dull because I I go through uhm  Halle and Mohanan and Chomsky and Halle and Halle nineteen seventy-seven paper on  and just basically take them to bits  
 Mm mm 
 Mm 
 Definitely 
 Yes 
 Yeah 
 Mm 
 Mm 
 Yeah 
 I 'll do that then 
 So 
 But during that week maybe you could just look at the first chapter  
 And it would be revision by then because you 'd have read quite a lot on this 
 Mm 
 uhm yes 
 Yeah 
 So it 'll be reasonably swift 
 Fine  
 Right this is general sets 
 and has uh visited including A and B here and we know these are differentiable 
 Now what 's what 's the sort of condition 
 I mean you if you imagine a function which is just 
 We can draw a which is 
 If you got you got a 
 If it  goes up like that and then it starts going down you 've got a problem  
 right 
 So wh what 's what 's the condition 
  
 Mmm mmm 
  
 What uh space   
 Strict yeah 
 It 's meaningless 
 Pardon 
  
 Strictly increasing or decreasing 
 Strict Strictly the increasing or decreasing  
 OK that 's 
 That 's the condition so 
 And once it 's strictly increasing or decreasing o over that then it 's certainly one to one 
 There 's no problem is there 
 Because if you have  F X one  is equal to F X two  and X one doesn't equal X two  say X one is strictly less than X two  then you know that F X one  is less than F X two cos it 's strictly increasing  
 So when you have a differentiable function which is basically they 're not always like that it could be a continuous function 
 but then the function has got to be increasing  
 And in fact it 's also true for continuous functions 
 You can then show that it must be increasing or decreasing 
 So if it 's continuous you can't  jump up like that 
 OK  
 Because it wouldn't be continuous there 
 So it 's actually a proper increasing function  
 OK  
 So for example if you wanted to supposing you 're looking at sine X  and you wanted to define  an inverse to sine X  I mean how are you going to do that how are you going to do that 
 That 's neither increasing nor decreasing 
 What are What What have you got to do 
 What 's the strategy 
 Mmm 
 You have to limit  
 Just You have 
 You have to limit it 
 You can only find an inverse for certain bits 
 And what sort of bits have they got to be 
  
  
 Between the maximum 
 So it 'll be between  
 Yeah 
 So one place would be here 
 Why 's that 
 Because the function 's increasing there 
 Equally as well we could do it between here and here  or you could do it between here and there 
 So there are lots of different ways you can find an inverse of sine 
 but  the standard one is to take it from minus pi by two  to plus pi by two 
 OK  
 So now we 're coming back to X cubed 
 And why are you stuck on that 
 You 're very good on this 
 so what I want you to be stuck on is F X equals X cubed 
 F  sends R to R  and X goes to X cubed 
 Well why 's that 
 Yeah 
 Cos 
 What 's the question 
 Right 
 Now 
 What 's the question please 
 Ah what 's the question 
 Show that the functions defined by F X by X goes to X cubed has an inverse K minus one but show that K minus one is not differentiable at zero  
 OK 
 Well let 's first of all show it 
 What How can we show it 's an inverse  
 It 's bijective cube 
 Cube 
 Well all right 
 So we 've got to prove it 's bijective  
 How we going to prove it 's bijectal  
 And you 're allowed to draw a picture of you 're allow and you draw you 're allowed to draw a picture if you want  
 It 's increasing 
 So how do we prove it 's increasing  
  
 It 's increasing 
 Uhm  general 
 The  
 Uhm that that 's the definition 
 but how would you actually do it 
 X uh X one is greater than 
  
  
 Yes but how would you do it 
 If this was A level you 'd be writing   
  
 What   
 for X  
 You you 've got a defrent You 've got a differentiable function 
 and when do you know a differentiable function is increasing  
 Oh if it 's less than nought 
 If when you differentiate it it 's  
 So So you look at its derivative 
 Right 
 And if that 's greater than nought then you know it 's a strictly   
 So  F dash of X  is equal to three X squared  
 It 's greater than nought so if X equals nought that doesn't matter 
 So you 've got a nice increasing function and you know you 've got an increasing function  
 OK 
 Now how do you know  
 Right it 's increasing so  it increases  so it 's indefinite  in one model  
 OK  
 Now how do you know what that functions on to  
 It 's something that we were doing two or three weeks ago  
 It 's defined for every X 
 and what I 'm saying is  that if you like here 's here 's your first bar along here  
 and this function is mapping this over here 
 So here 's your second bar 
 How do I know that every point from here comes from a point down here 
 When we draw the graph it 's obvious isn't it 
 You sit there and you have a look at it 
 It 's obvious  
 and of course anything that 's obvious in analysis there must be a proper rational proof for 
 So now what what sort of theory are we going to try and prove that with  
 Mmm 
 Theorem minus three 
 Theorem minus three  
 What does that say  
 What What do you know about X cubed as X tends to infinity  
 It tends to infinity 
 So this F X tends to infinity right  
 And supposing I take a value K  and I want to know if F X affects that value 
 Right  
 Well from X greater or equal to X  we certainly have a value where F X  will be greater than K  
 OK 
 Let 's call it F X two  
 And we also know because when X tends to minus infinity X cubed tends to minus infinity there 'll be another place where F X one is strictly less than  
 Because X cubed tends to infinity for some X two  there 'll be a value of F X two greater than K 
 and because X cubed tends to minus infinity  uh there 'll be a value here  not necessarily minus such that K is greater than F X one 
 yeah  
 Now  you see there K stuck between F is something F is something 
 a theorem should come to your mind like a flash of lightning  
 What theorem were we doing 
 Remember we had 
 not only is this function  interm 
 Brilliant 
 OK 
 Remember 
 if it was F A  and F B and gamma stuck in the middle or C stuck in the middle right then you know there must must be a value 
 So that tells you three-or-four-words 
 There exists  an X such that F X equals A  
 OK  
 I mean another way of looking at that is that if you have a continuous function when you apply it to an interval  it goes to an interval  and since you can get things up here as big as you like  this thing has to be an interval 
 So that tells you then that X goes to X cubed is  one 
 it 's injective cos increasing  
 It 's almost  essentially why you 're using the intermediate value theorem  
 If you like all all that that 's saying is you could if you were innocent and you wanted to prove that you 'd say 
 well every particular number has a cubed root 
 and actually what we 've proved is the intermediate value theorem that tells you every number has a cubed root 
  tells you that every number has a unique cube root 
 And the inverse of this function is going to be a cube root function  
 Right 
 If I can get the cubes and you then you get back to cube roots  
 OK 
 So now  we have an injective  
 We have a bijective function 
 That ta shows you that K is  
 Bijective is not too difficult 
 I mean all right you might not have got this  thing exactly right but you should have been able to do the rest 
 And so what what what why what was so difficult about it  
 Intermediate value theorem 
 I never know how valid the answers are   
 Yeah yeah 
 It 's very difficult isn't it 
 You know this is what you learn that there 's no you learn with practice  
 You know you keep getting  things and you put too much in  
 Don't put so many arguments in 
 and then you don't something in 
 Don't leave out the crucial stage 
 So there 's a sort of maturity here mathematical maturity 
 You 're putting in the right kind of argument and also not to have waffly arguments like saying 
 well it 's injective because it 's one 
 one which really is just saying the same thing 
 and you 've got to have a real functional argument to justify what what you 're doing 
 You know get down and really have a proper argument  based on the facts and theorems that you know  
 Now what about what about the uh  the theory that it 's not differentiable 
 I now know what theorem minus three is about cos I asked Professor Larman what it was  and he said it 's the appropriate theorem for this for this result  which wasn't very helpful 
 You see it appears in in the question doesn't it  
 So that was a quite good uh thing to to say 
 Right 
 Now  what i what is the result saying 
 Supposing we have  A goes to B  F 
 Supposing this is one one one two  and continuous  
 We know F minus one exists 
 B to A exists  
 What can you say about F minus one  
 If I know F is continuous 
 right 
 what can I say about F minus one 
 Oh yes 
 Mmm 
 Oh it 's continuous 
 Right 
 So one theory is that if you have a function from interval A to interval B which is a bijection then the inverse function will be continuous 
 If this is continuous then the inverse function is continuous 
 Right  
 Supposing this is differentiable  
 So this  
 Now if it 's differentiable  what can you say about F minus one 
 Well it 's differentiable as well 
 Differentiable  
  
 F minus one is differentiable always 
 Only when it 's got a  
 But when when when  will the derivative  
 Right 
 So when you differentiate F minus one if you like can look at Y is equal to F X  and therefore you have X is equal to F to the minus one  Y 
 So you 're trying to find out  uhm trying to find out what that is what is D by D Y  of F to the minus one  
 It 's equal to D X by D Y  and that is equal to  one over  F dash X  
 OK  
 But X is equal to F minus one equal to one over F dash  F minus one  Y 
 OK  
 If you like  D Y D X of F minus one X  is one over F dash  of uh  minus one of X at that point  
 OK 
 But the thing is  it doesn't work when that 's zero so you 're going to have the derivative not being zero at that particular point  
 OK 
 And of course what happens here is the derivative at X equals nought  
 F dash nought  is equal to zero and so you 've got a problem  
 OK 
 So that 's evident 
 If you look If you look at theorem minus three it says it is differentiable provided the derivative of that point is non-zero  
 Now did you look at the theorem minus three  or didn't you do 
 Only when it 's got  
 Gap in my notes 
 Pardon 
 You 've got a gap in your notes 
 What about the rest of you who asked  
 Yeah yeah but it was just you know like being sure that you had kind of like the right 
 Oh never mind a bit of insecurity  
  you should Listen you should be out on your own 
 You should be able to be adventurous and take your own sort of  uh things and make your own 
 You You 'll only learn how from your own mistakes 
 Uhm  now at this point I 'm going to  leave some more work to you  
 Uhm now here we 've got The Harlot 's  Progress 
 There 's a plate  
 And can you  uhm just point out some of the sort of satirical elements in this work what  elements of satire what ways of satirising 
 Again I 'm not really concerned so much with meaning but the ways in which the satire is  achieved  
 Well all right 
 For a start we 've got the uh pile of pots and pans in that doorway on the left 
 Yes 
 What do What do they signify 
 Well that 's the fall of the girl presumably from  well not from grace perhaps but you know from 
 Well uhm  yes 
 I mean it it it it  
 Everything 's topsy-turvy in the  
 Yes  
 Could suggest loss of virginity couldn't it because I mean often broken pots  
 Uhm something 's about to be broken 
 It 's not quite 
 It 's in the process of being broken 
 She At this precise moment she 's being taken in hand by a notorious bawd 
 So that could be what it it 's uh  
 Uh but it does suggest perhaps impending disaster to    
 Some of the clergymen mirror what 's the corruption that 's going on between the girl and the bawd Y 
 Yes 
 I mean yes there is a sense in which she is a sort of fa&ccedille;ade and then behind her is what 's really going on 
 In other words she is being a nice grandmotherly soul to this innocent country girl 
 but behind her is the notorious uhm  uh Colonel Charteris who was again supposed to have used prostitutes to procure innocent young virgins for him to seduce and then turn into prostitutes  
 Uhm so that 's uh so that 's so in a sense there is a kind of special strategy there isn't there of actually sort of making a foreground and a background as part of the point  
 Anything else  
 Yes 
 Does this bell there chequers mean anything 
 Yes 
 Well I don't know 
 Chequers the bell yes 
 What does the bell mean  
 Mm 
 Uhm  
 Well then could it be to ring out a warning 
 Well uh yes yes 
 I mean I don't uh uh 
 Yes 
 But I mean it 's one of the things that you get so often in these uh caricatures 
 After all one of the things it 's easy to forget that in the early eighteenth century indeed all the way upt within living memory that people actually knew the Bible very well and that they automatically when seeing a bell would think of  bells  
 Uhm and you find that uh i in all sorts of ways that that certain assumptions are made 
 Not Not always 
 Uhm and indeed some scholars have actually exaggerated it enormously and seen this as for instance a kind of uhm s satire on the Visitation of the Virgin and and seen the whole thing in terms of Biblical analogies  
 Uh that seems to me far fetched 
 But the the potential is there certainly  
 Uhm and often where you 've got uh inscriptions below it it sometimes signals Biblical parallel  
 In in In The Rake 's Progress for instance you 've got a commentary underneath the the the series  which is written by a vicar  
 And he actually signals Biblical parallels 
 And  it 's one of the ways in which uhm analogies are made so often in satire in the eighteenth century  
 Either with perhaps a classical parallel 
 that 's a parallel taken from an old master painting or from the Bible  
 You look puzzled 
 A bit 
 No 
   
 Obviously not 
 Uhm  again the the the the difficulty with interpretation of course of these things is that visual uhm signifiers as it were don't always uhm you can't always see what in fact they 're signifying 
 And you might see uh this on the one hand is  possibly meant to suggest uh the universal fate of mankind 
 but we do also know that coaches came in from Berlin as well  
 Uhm 
 and one of the problems with the sort of naturalistic mode of Hogarth 's uhm  modern moral subjects like this is that you don't you can't guess for certain the the the you know the these signifier these natural signifiers that aren't actually uhm simply what they claim to be  
 So they signal uhm signifies 
 On the one hand the Bell Inn 
 That 's clear enough uhm 
 But could it also signify uhm uh they 're in or whatever 
 Uhm  yes 
 What other modes of satire do you see  
 Right 
 Uhm the characterisation of the  forget her name now the old bawd 
 The way she 's sort of 
 Yes yes 
 Mother Eden 
 Yes 
 Yeah 
 The way she 's really poxy underneath 
 Yes 
 She 's sort of poxy but very well dressed 
 Yes  yes  yes 
 Which again uh could have a number of possible  uh  meanings 
 It could mean uhm simply identify her as a an old bawd as a danger 
 But it could also suggest the dangers of of what may lurk behind fine clothes as well 
 So a kind of moralising point  
 Uhm just as Colonel Charteris is a man of military rank and yet a a wanton seducer  uhm so she 
 And she was notorious Mother Megan for dressing up in Sunday best  at all times 
 And of course it 's not a Sunday generally  
 Yeah 
 Mm 
 What does this goose mean down here 
 Yes 
 I was wondering about that 
 Well uh all right 
 Well there we are 
 What does it mean  
 Addressed to her loafing cousin 
 her loafing cousin  
 Uhm 
 And a lot of people say that it 's deliberately misspelt I don't know to suggest her ignorance or innocence as she 's come from a very remote part of the country 
 She 's come from York  on the York stage  which is  no small distance in the eighteenth century  
 Uhm  but there is a possibility that it could also symbolize that she 's a goose a sort of silly goose   
 Was it alive do you think when she set out for the country was it 
 Was it meant to be dead 
 I 'm sorry 
 Oh I see yes 
 I mean I 'd ra I would imagine that that 's what people from the country would bring to cousins in the city wouldn't you think a a a nice fat goose 
 It wouldn't be It wouldn't be a 
 It wouldn't be a live goose though 
 Oh I see 
 No 
 Probably not 
 No  
 Uhm it may also of course 
 The other thing is that you 've sometimes these may refer to common expressions like silly goose or word or  something like that 
 It 's possible 
 She 's a silly goose  
 Uhm  and you can see that that again the problem with the the kind of attempted naturalism of of these things is you know how far are you meant to go uhm in the interpretation 
 And And one of the you know principal arguments   of Ronald Olson who uhm  who works really on the sort of principle that anything you can throw in is plausible and you can make a great deal of the irony of the visitation 
 He sees the whole thing series in terms of Biblical analogies and some of them are quite preposterous I think  
 Uhm  yes 
 Any other satirical satiric strategies here 
  
 Is that what the uh the young girl is going to become  
 Mm 
 Well that that that 's an an an interesting idea 
 Yes 
 three-or-four-words 
 Cos she 's hanging out looking word word 
 Yeah 
 I don't know 
 Uhm  it 's possible  certainly possible 
 Uh I think again the uh that 's a very interesting point that Philip 's made 
 you see that that quite often uh particularly in in 
 I mean there is a narrative sense in these modern world subjects which means that you can that often uhm  the future is signified in some way or another  
 or past  
 In this case that could intimate the future of this word girl 
 Yeah 
 Good  
 But of course in a narrative series the the question of time is very important  
 But again I haven't got I don't really want to go into that at this stage 
 I just wanted to establish that there are ways of analysing 
 And And of course there again the other form that 's worth looking at is is is sort of typecasting if you like 
 Uhm this is the country vicar seeking preferment 
 And he 's got a uhm a letter of introduction to the Bishop of London 
 And he wants to find the Bishop of London uhm to ask him for a resident benefice and 
 and in the meantime he 's totally neglectful of  the fate of of   but also all the other goals in the uhm  Church 
 So it 's like a sort of if you imagine in present day terms going to sort of King 's Cross with all these  coming off  the train    to Scotland and then uhm and then uh the vicar totally ignoring the sort of moral danger they 're in 
 And that 's the equivalent in today 's terms  
 So quite a lot of different sorts of strategies at work here  
 Now in a way the uhm uh  one thing that I think is quite clear about that one is is that it 's that the target is in some sense uhm  uh uh sort of of the mortal danger of of  uhm  sexual license or or whatever 
 But there is there are other possible targets as well 
 And there is a sense in which and Hogarth I think realised this that satire is also a form of entertainment 
 Uhm  I wanted to show you the uh one of the actresses dressing in the barn 
 Now what do you think is actually being satirised here would you say  
 Sorry 
 What did you say this was 
 It 's called Actresses Dressing in a Barn 
 Thank you  
 What 's actually going on 
 What is one observing here  
 There 's this fop on the left who 's been trying to seduce  
 Uh yes 
 I mean  possibly 
 But what are what are all the people here 
 what are they all doing 
 What 've they all got in common  
 Every single person  except one   
 What are they all doing  
 Well I mean they 're all acting aren't they 
 I mean they 're all uh 
 And so the the the joke is that you 're seeing uh this  uh figure of Diana uhm just at the point where she 's putting her shift on  
 And you 've got there Juno sort of declaiming her lines 
 And I think in many ways that the main 
 And there are a couple of uhm whatever they are putti or whatever uhm cupids uhm who are  drinking beer on top of a cardboard altar or something made of similarly flimsy stuff 
 And I think one of the wittiest bits really is the figure of evil there who turns out to be  a woman you see inside there 
 and she 's feeding a baby    
 So uhm  
 And then 
 yes of course this is a some sort of love scene going on 
 but you notice she 's got a sort of mermaid 's tail as well  
 uhm  and then there is uhm an angel or a cupid probably going up the ladder to see if his socks are dry uhm 
 and so on and so on 
 I mean you can just go on and on 
 And then down below you 've got some kittens who are playing with those props  uhm including an orb  
 Uhm and there are also crowns and bishops ' mitres and all sort of things down there  
 So what 's being satirised  
 The acting profession as a whole  
 Well uhm  
 Well is it the kind of plays they put on then 
 Well yes The the 
 They 
 Well no no 
 I mean we know what the play is 
 It 's called uhm  uh it 's called The Devil to Pay in Heaven or something 
 And it is certainly satirical of a play by Fielding or somebody at that time 
 Popular play you know  
 And then here we see the larger sort of themes 
 One over here  
 Is it about religion the fact that they can play act act at being you know religious or whatever including big word props 
 Well I think that 's that makes it sound a bit more puritanical 
 It 's certainly an attack on on sort of vanity isn't it and and artifice isn't it 
 I mean the contrast is everywhere being made even in the shirts hanging on a line and 
 and th th the fact they 're in this leaky barn with a peeping tom uhm is the the contrast between the pretensions of uhm the sort of these people who are acting as gods on Parnassus 
 and yet at the same time they are confined to this miserable country barn 
 Uhm 
 So it 's it 's a if you like a meditation  on on sort of pretence and vanity 
 So we might as well start by   anything in particular that you 'd like to discuss  
 Do you think these tutorials are a waste of time  
 The class seems to be voting with its feet 
 I think the tutorials are helpful 
 Can we have some like next term near the exam time 
 because at the moment we 've all got like so much work to do I haven't had time to like go through the lecture notes and things 
 I couldn't actually tell you What I 'm stuck on at the moment cos I 've got like  my project that I have to hand in  and you know all  all  all the assessments 
 Yeah that would be 
 I I 'm afraid I don't think it is going to be possible unfortunately 
 but I think it 's something that we 'll have to bear in mind for future years that  if if the tutorials during the course are not 
 Quite frankly it 's just not really worth our while running them for four people so that you know unless we can find an arrangement the whole class  finds useful then  
 You know 
 On the one hand students  find lectures rather boring and intimidating 
 and yet given an opportunity to come to a more informal tutorial they they don't bother to come 
 So we 're sort of caught in a a trap 
 Yeah  
 Uhm but I take your point and we can 
 You know I think it 's not going to be possible actually to to do that next term unfortunately 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 But I mean if I if I need some help could I still come 
 Yeah but I don't think there 'll be formal tutorials 
 You can ask specific questions on occasions but you know unfortunately we 've got major commitments  and now 's the opportunity we 've allocated to deal with that  
 OK 
 well anyway I mean you four are the people who 've come 
 so you deserve the the reward for your diligence 
 So let 's let 's take the opportunity to discuss our  the lectures which I 've given you recently which are dealing with the special senses 
 Is there any specific problem related to them or is the subject matter clear  
 From time to time 
 Mm 
 
 The primary in that sense means the first relay neuron which lies in the periphery  
 So in the case of the  sensory system which deals with the sensation from the whole body the primary neuron the central neuron is the neuron that aligns with itself in the dorsary ganglia and whose axons make up peripheral nerves and dorsal roots 
 OK 
 So that 's a primary sensory neuron 
 And the same with the auditory pathway 
 The primary auditory neuron is the neuron  the spinal membrane and whose peripheral axon goes to the hair cells 
 And the central axon makes up the cochleal nerve  
 So that it 's the first sensory neuron in the system that makes the primary neuron 
 Secondary pathways are the pathways that then run from the next neuron along  
 So they 
 These 
 And the secondary pathways are all within the central nervous system 
 They 're not  the system  
 Anything else 
 Any other specifics  
 Have you done the before the structure of the eye 
 have you covered that in any other course 
 Right 
 
 You have done that 
 
 And that was covered in what kind of detail 
 
 All right 
 Did you 
 And so in a sense I 'm asking you 
 I mean have you you 've never you haven't come across the structure of the eye before 
 Yeah I have 
 You have 
 So that you 're happy 
 Yeah 
 Can you go again through all the different layers through the  eye 
 I 
 In this giant cortex it 's simple complex hypercomplex 
 Is that right 
 Right 
 And then  in the retina 
 That 's where you have all your  ganglion bipolar whatever 
 But which order do they come in  
 What connects to what and 
 The two the two the two are not unrelated 
 You shouldn't confuse the cortex with the retina I think 
 Yeah 
 You know they have quite separate functions 
 But what 's like the hierarchical arrangement of the cells 
 I mean is it like bipolar joins on to horizontal to 
 You know what I mean 
 I I know what cells 
 OK well don't mix up the retina with the  cortex tha tha 
 That 's quite different 
 Well does anybody know what is the  the 
 If If a photon of light hits the retina what c what cells does it act on 
 Yeah 
 
 Right 
 It acts on the photoreceptors 
 So what is the nex 
 In a sense you 're asking what is the next stage 
 But doesn't it have to go through all the other cells first because of the arrangement 
 Well that 's 
 Yeah 
 Well that just happens to be 
 That doesn't matter 
 It 's not passing on information 
 It 's just It just so happens that these cells are transparent so that photons can go through them but it 's not  changing those cells or acting on them 
 It 's the same way with light coming through a through a pane of glass 
 You don't say that the glass was changed by the light 
 It 's only the photoreceptors that detect the light 
 So the fact that they are piled on top of the photoreceptors is irrelevant cos they as far as the light is concerned they they 're not there 
 That 's what transparent means 
 It goes through 
 The light The photon travels through without being either absorbed or reflected  
 Yeah 
 But I mean why 
 What 's the point of that arrangement 
 Is it just 
 Well ask evolution 
 You know that 's 
 What 's 
 The point is there was some advantage during evolution  to to create the 
 Well try and think about it 
 Why do you think we needed 
 The arrangement is The anatomical arrangement as opposed to the flow of information is that on the the innermost surface of the retina you 've got the axons of the ganglion cells 
 Then you 've got ganglion cells 
 Then you 've got the relay neurons which are the bipolar cells and the horizontal  cells and then you 've got the photoreceptors and then you 've got a layer of what  
 It 's the innermost layer of the retina 
 Sorry the outermost layer of the retina 
 Yeah 
 Is that pigment 
 Yeah pigment  
 So what possible functional advantage can you have from the fact that light has to travel through a row of at least three cells to get to the photoreceptors  given the information I 've given you  
 Well it 's the fact that the photoreceptors are immediately adjacent to the pigment  and  it prevents the light being reflected or and it abs absorbs 
 The light is either acts on the on the photoreceptors or disappears effectively from the retina 
 That 's what the pigment does 
 It absorbs the light and that 's why it 's black  
 So that it 's like in a camera 
 You need to get a a good sharp image 
 The light must not be scattered or reflected in in any way  
 So it just improves the image if you have a black surface on which the photo-sensitive elements ar arrive 
 and the only way it could then arrange it if if you 're going to have processing of the cells is to have the processing cells on top provided they are transparent 
 In other words as far as the light is concerned they aren't there 
 Makes no difference so it 's no problem  
 So wha what do like 
 I know you said 
 they 're all processing cells 
 But what do they do they actually do individually  
 Well when  photon interacts with the photoreceptor it changes the the ionic count in that photoreceptor  
 And the cell as we discussed does the opposite of all other sensory neurons and hyperpolarises instead of bipolarising  and that information is transferred to bipolar cells  
 And those bipolar cells transfer that information to ganglion cells  
 and the ganglion cells are affected by groups of photoreceptors via the horizontal and cells which transfer information horizontally 
 So you 've got both vertical transfer of information from photoreceptors to the ganglion cells and horizontal direction of information transfer across the the retina 
 In the end that means that your ganglion cell has a receptive field 
 and you know what a receptive field now is 
 It 's that area of the visual field where if it 's activated the ganglion cell will fire 
 And ganglion cells have what kind of receptor fields 
 Do you remember 
 Spiral 
 Yes 
 You have a concentric on-off cell so that you can have either have the centre of the field on 
 In other words when the light is shone in that on field the cell will fire a series of action potential  with an off surround so that if  the cell will be inhibited  
 We can have the reverse where it 's an on surround or an off centre and that receptive field is created by bipolar cells and horizontal and cells acting on on ganglion cells 
 You don't have a single photoreceptor going to a single bipolar cell going to a single uhm a single photoreceptor a single bipolar cell a single ganglion 
 If you had that you wouldn't have these receptor fields would you 
 Receptor fields are constructed from many  cells but the information is transferred and processed and converges on the ganglion cells through these bipolar horizontal cells 
 which  horizontal cells 
 Uhm from ganglion cells 
 Is that from where you get the optic nerve 
 Right 
 The ganglion cells give off axons which then flow out over the surface the inner surface of the retina and may then leave the retina through what 
 Remember 
 What part of the retina 
 Optic  
 Well the optic  is where they leave the orbits 
 but the actual nerve fibres to make up the optic nerve where do they leave the retina 
 At the fovea 
  
 No  
 Fovea 's the exact opposite 
 The fovea 's the most densely uh innervated part of  the most dense collection of cones 
 So it 's the blind spot or optic disc 
 Structurally it 's the optic disc 
 Functionally it 's the blind spot  because it 's blind in the sense that if you  you can map out if if if I mapped out your your visual field as a small little object carefully mapping out there is a  point  there 's a point in your receptor field but you will not see that object that small object 
 You will become blind  
 There 's a part of our each of us has a recep part of our visual field where there 's a hole and we don't see anything 
 and that 's the blind spot 
 and that is anatomically the place where the optic disk lies  
 OK 
 Can you explain about these uhm  columns in the uhm   cortex 
 Right 
 We can get to it in a moment 
 Lets Let 's just go through  the pathway just to make sure you 're happy with that 
 Are you 
 So tha that 's the basic arrangement of the retina 
 and then you 've got the optic nerve  
 and it 's 
 Wha What happens to the optic nerve when it it leaves uh enters the cranial cavity  
 You get decussation of the nasal uhm  field 
 Oh I don't 
 the optic track on the nasal side of both eyes 
 Right  it 's not the nasal 
 You must be very careful with that cos otherwise you 're going to get confused 
 It 's not the nasal field  that decussates 
 It 's the nasal retina that that decussates 
 So it 's the fibres on the nasal retina 
 What part of the visual field does the nasal retina serve 
 
 The lateral or temporal field 
 You see one mustn't confuse the retina and the field 
 They are opposite because the lens  turns the light upside down 
 If you look in a camera with a lens what happens to the image 
 It 's turned upside down and back to front 
 That 's exactly what happens in our eyes and that 's why the nasal retina actually sees light  from the lateral field 
 So what I see when I see my hand over here that is hitting my nasal retina over on this side over there 
 Last last week when we were in cognitive psychology and stuff things got a li just a little bit tutorialish  me doing much of the speaking  
 So uh this week 
 and what I 'd like people to do is uh give brief  summaries to the group about the contents of their essays 
 Now three of them I only got this morning so I haven't had time to look at  uhm but I still might ask someone to do them 
 To give people some forewarning uh Matt who did nature versus nurture generally could maybe start things off 
 Now when we s These are just people 
 I just want them to  summarize the contents of their essay so I could just start looking through it now 
 I don't want them to sort of just read it out in fact tell people  
 The The uh summary should be made to the to the rest of the group 
 and people on the basis of the voluminous reading which I know you 've all done are invited to uh ask the speaker questions 
 They probably might be to me in fact 
 It 's not up to me to sort of regulate what people say or what questions they 've got or anything  
 Uh  Colin covered 
 I would like to get a a balance of all the subjects 
 Colin was the  the only person who did anything of a cognitive nature and did language acquisition so Colin  can  summarize that after Matt  
 Uh we need something more biological 
 I 've got  uh it 's Esther yeah uh essay on uh well on homosexuality though I suggest it might be better thought of as on sexuality more generally uhm  
 Uh or  you could have depressive illness  or schizophrenia I think  
 Any votes for any of these  what people would like to discuss 
 Sexuality I think 
 We 've got one vote for sexuality 
 Anyone have  any other preferences  
 I hear 
 You 're obviously all galvanised by you your uh study and desperately wanting to talk about these things  uh  
 OK well given that there was one vote we will have uh  Esther can tell us all about sexuality uh later  
 And then maybe uh  we 'll see how the time goes 
 Uh couple of things we need t to uh consider  in this that the people want to   
 Uh one is  what just what are these influences 
 If s If you say something is influenced by nature what is it  how does it work  and  how can we test it 
 This is always a question in psychology for any area 
 Whatever problem comes up you always have this issue in experimental psychology of how we test it 
 If people can just make random assertions about some issue that you can just not possibly go out and do doing testing on it 
 It just isn't it 's philosophy or something 
 I don't know 
 but it just it doesn't become psychology until we can sort of do something about it 
 otherwise if people just say what they want there 's no way of telling what it 's like 
 and so so what you know it 's considered largely a waste of well not a waste of time 
 it 's just that  perfectly balanced way of spending your time  
 Somebody for nurture 
 What do we mean by uh  the environment of some kind 
 Most people in their essays say 
 well environmental influences 
 and this is the way people thought typically in uh well the past in texts and so forth 
 People just talk  about the environment as though it 's obvious 
 precisely what it is  would just be the sum total of everything that surrounds the individual 
 So clearly does everything affect people 
 or is there some selection process by which the organism selectively responds  
 Uhm again how do we test uh  
 Can we test these things  
 Someone says uh  to uh  social conditioning 
 so girls are told to wear dresses wear clothes and so forth 
 and that 's what turns them into  women 
 How do we 
 I mean maybe it 's not true 
 but how do we try and find out 
 find out  
 Well that 's an issue which is a crucial one 
 Is the  interaction in practically every case you get some interaction even when you when you can't test these things 
 When you do test them you never get  you never seem to fi find for psychological traits or at least that it 's either a hundred per cent correlated with genetics or it 's it 's highly uncorrelated cos you always seem to get some sort of mixture 
 And if there is a mixture uh  how does it happen  
 Uh this relates to  uh something we touched on last week when we were talking about the relationship between cognitive explanations  
 someone does something because they believe so and so such and such  and physiological uh measures 
 If I say that uh  uh someone 's someone 's heart rate is rapidly increasing because they believe they 're going to die  you have on the one hand the physical observation increase in heart rate on the other hand the inscription the belief 
 they believe they 're going to die 
 We have a problem in psychology in terms of how these two things can link up 
 Belief isn't does not say about a physical state  of the system so we want to know how come beliefs can change heart rates  
 Well  in this area we have the same problem 
 Nature is  is really just about genetics  about transmission of genes from parents to the offspring and genes just they recode for  things like proteins all descriptions on the genetic level known to be in terms largely of biochemistry  
 On one level the language of genetics is biochemistry  
 Language of the environment seems to say things  that 've got nothing to do with biochemistry  
 It says such and such a  these things just are not about biochemistry 
 If if the two are to interact how can these two languages  interact 
 Oh but they can't really 
 so by what means are we going to link them up if we if we are going to say that they there is a  uh interaction  
 Basically it 's the same problem with  biological levels of explanation for ordinary behaviour 
 Can't we link them 
 And you have the same issue for environment and genetics OK 
 So these are the sort of things that uh  you  might be thinking about 
 I mean you can think anything else you want 
 but these are sort of the central 
 or at least I I assume it is the central issue  
 So uh Matt did you uh  did you explain uhm 
 Uhm right  
 To start with then you 've got to decide what the environment and what uh what nature and what nurture is  
 Uhm nature basically means your genetics your hereditary what is passed down to you from your parents 
 Now this is your chromosomes and your genes 
 Now this within your genes is the information to uhm  to tell cells in your body what to do 
 Now basically what each gene does is tell a cell to build certain protein  
 Uhm that then makes the cell function in a certain way and all the cells in your body then need to work together to make you do certain things 
 Now uhm  genes in your body will all work together to produce certain physical characteristics if it  such as your height your weight your hair colour your eye colour 
 All of these things are uhm  genetically sort of decided when you 're born 
 That 's a fact 
 It 's years of study and it 's obvious that someone is born and they have to develop into a certain height because of their genes coded into certain proteins in their body 
 That 's enough  
 Yeah  
 So nothing that could happen to them during their life 
 Well basically you 're born with genes which say you 're going to be small or big yeah  
 Is everyone agreed 
 I mean fine if you don't 
 It depends as well if don't have enough food or  as you grow so  
 but the environment  depends what situation you 're put in 
 Well 
 Yeah but 
 But surely it means  
 Yeah but your genes still say you 're going to be small or big 
 If you then have like if you 've got plenty of food you then grow to be big  if you 've got the genes 
 Hang on 
 say you got a gene which say you 're going to have good bone structure you 're going to have good muscles and you 're going to grow to be big 
 You then have a lot of food 
 you 're going grow to be big 
 You then don't have a lot of food you 're you 're not going to be as big as you would have been  but you 'd still be bigger than someone who had small genes and didn't have a lot of food d' you understand 
 It 's interaction to set right across 
 I was just saying what genes were first of all 
 Mmm 
 Oh right 
 Uh don't worry about the people interrupting you  
 You 're gonna have to  sort of thing 
 Uhm right OK nurturing is what happens to you from your environment your uhm  
 First of all you 've got to say what your environment is  
 Environment is everything that happens to you which you sense happening to you as you grow up through life 
 All the things which occur around you and you sense through your eyes your ears your feeling 
 All of these things are your environment and they interact with your genes to uh affect the way in which you develop  
 Right so that 's what nature and nurture is 
 Now we can look through history at what people have thought which is the most important in how peo people will develop  
 Uhm  until the seventeenth century most people sort of believed that uhm  adults  humans were born into the world as miniature adults  that everything was due to the hereditary 
 They would be born in a certain way and whatever happened with their life they 'd grow up in the same way 
 Nothing that happened would change how they were going to turn out  
 That was until this bloke came along called uhm John Locke 
 Are you sure about this that this is what everyone thought as well 
 Yeah it was the sort of generally held thing that everyone came into the world just 
  I mean your source for that uhm  
 Well no  
 Anyway so we 've got 
 Does everybody else know that 
 Yeah 
 I mean uh uh where would you where would 
 how would you try and verify this uh assertion that uh 
 Well through what people who have written during the seventeenth century they have sort of said before John Locke came along uhm  they believed that humans were born into the world and then grew up 
 Whatever happened in affects the way they grew up 
 When when did Locke uh  write 
 Some time in the seventeenth century 
 D' you mean the seventeen hundreds  
 No   
 I think it was the I think it was the seventeen hundreds 
 Was it eighteenth century  perhaps the seventeenth century  
 The seventeenth century 
 It was seventeenth century  
 But before then I mean  you 're saying that before then  everyone thought that  it was genetics 
 Well not everyone 
 No I didn't say it was genetics 
 Also they didn't know what genetics was 
 They thought that it was that people were just born in a certain way and grew up  and that their environment played no influence in how  
  the stars or 
 All right 
 That doesn't count uhm  
 The the idea that that there was this that the people everyone then was some sort of genetic degenerate 
 Not everyone but generally hel 
 All right all right 
 It was a generally held opinion that people were born into the world  and the way they developed was then already sort of set 
 Whatever happened after they were born had no influence on the way in which they developed 
 So you don't believe in an absolute fate in themselves in the  
 Uhm well not fate in the way that sort of what happens to them but the way they developed into that type of person their physical characteristics 
 I think it 's all  
 Let 's say uhm that the support for this view found in the works of William Shakespeare perhaps a line where William Shakespeare agrees  
 Uhm there 's a I think there 's a line in Julius Caesar regarding the faults 
 I can't remember who he was talking to 
 OK 
 Are we ready 
 are we ready to start now  
 Right 
 What I 'd like to do this afternoon is to  have one of our interpretation sessions similar to the earlier ones that we 've had uhm looking at correspondence analysis that we 've not yet looked at  
 Uhm I 've got two two handouts  
 This one that we 'll need first  
 And then the the other one  is that one  
 And the first one comes from Winchester  and it 's all published  and you can easily read about it later 
 Uhm that 's that 's the article  
 It 's in Object and Economy in Medieval Winchester  which I don't suggest you buy as it costs about two hundred pounds  
 but I think the library 's got it 
 and then  if anyone wants to photocopy that they 're welcome to photocopy the whole article  
 We 'll just be looking at one small aspect  
 So what I 'll do  is explain  the  the handout what the various bits of it are  and then leave you to work together in twos or threes whatever you think 's appropriate twos I should think  to see what you can make of it very briefly 
 And then we 'll come back and talk about ha how how we actually interpret  these results  
 I 'm reasonably confident of that one 
 I mean I think I know what 's going on 
 Put it that way 
 Which one 
 The the Winchester one  
 The other one I 'm much less confident about  
 The other one is Portchester Castle 
 It 's a Roman site  and that 's much more of a problem  and that is in some respects still an unresolved issue  so you may need to have something which will  help  
  you need a couple of handouts 
 Yeah 
 That is the other one 
 I 've still got some 
 Which is that one 
 
 We 're doing this one first  
 That 's it 
 OK 
 Right 
 Right  
 The dat The data that I got from the Winchester unit  consisted of large numbers of accounts diff different types different types of finds  that were found in different types of site and were found in context of different dates 
 So it 's a three word word 
 We 've got type of find  we got date and we got type of site  
 But we 're only going to be looking at one aspect of that which is the date and type of find 
 We 're not looking at the type of site although that is in my view important  
 And in  the data actually came in the form of stretchy data 
 It was was a strange computer known as a Sinclair Q L  and  I don't know if anyone remembers them 
 They ran on microtapes 
 Mhm 
 And they were dangerous on the road too   
 So to to fill you in the first the first page gives you the names of the various  dates and then the names of the various types of artefact  and the date itself on the right hand side  
 So you 've got there the dates up the tenth century eleventh century and so on down to sixth seventeenth century plus  meaning seventeenth century and anything later than that  
 Then U S unstratified  artefacts which couldn't be assigned in dating context 
 All these are the dates of the context in which the artefact was found not the date that they think the artefact belongs to  
 And they correspond to the columns of the data on the right-hand side  and you 'll see there 's a full data set at the top and then a reduced data set at the bottom  and 
 Now hang on 
 Yeah 
 Mm 
 Eh 
 So those are the column headings 
 Those are the column headings about the tenth century eleventh century and so on 
  
 Ah  
 Right 
 OK 
 OK 
 Yeah 
 Right  
 And you 'll see that half way down it  shifts and there 's one there 's one column narrower  
 Yeah 
 And that 's because  the final column which is the unstratified stuff that 's been pruned off  
 Mm 
 No 
 uh 
 
 
 Uhm 
 Oh 
 Those are column headings 
 
 So what 's the one two one O four two which don't seem to be against the Up To Tenth Century 
 The one two  
 The top the top 
 The row the rows relate to the artefact types so that one two one O four two relates to beads 
 They 're not opposite each other 
 I just printed them out and photocopied them 
 Eh 
 Ea Each row of the table is an artefact type and each column is a century  
 In the order in which they occur here right 
 In the order in which they come on this 
 Right 
 Oh 
 Gawd 
 Yeah  
 Eh 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Eh 
 Oh 
 Eh 
 
 I dunno don't know 
 Eh 
 But there aren't enough columns in that because there 's more  
 Oh 
 Up to the tenth century is this 
 Sorry 
 because 
  
 
 
 Yes 
 He 
 That 's all right 
 Yeah 
 But then 
 
 
 And then once  
 Yes the  
 
 Mm 
 Mm 
 Aren't you clever  
 The next one is Doctor word 
 Can we begin  
 You notice that halfway down this trail of data there 's a line I 've drawn  
 OK  
 And you 'll note that it 's narrow 
 Now that is the reduced data set 
 I 'll explain later why it was reduced  
 I took out I took out some of the rows  and I took out the last column  and the  another set of names which are just a shortened list of the first list  
 And those are the types of artefact that actually appear in this reduced data set 
 So I took out some of the types that were causing trouble  
 Yeah 
 Mhm 
 You took out beads  
 Right  
 Yes 
 Mm mm 
 So that that 's the first page 
 What 's the little note on the right that says finds X date datable 
 Finds times date 
 These These are the final  that you can find on the computer 
 There 's a there 's a directory called finds times date  and then within that there 's a final reduced   
 And the other one is finds by date by full 
 Mm 
 What 's full 
 Four 
 Full 
 F U double L 
 Oh  
 There 's a full data set and a reduced data set 
 Right  
 If you turn over the page you get a pair of facing pages  which are to file find by date  results full 
 And that 's the correspondence analysis of the full data set  
 You get thirty-one times nine periods  
 And then if you go over that again  you 've then got find by date results reduced which is  another pair of facing pages   
 So that 's another analysis but on a reduced data scale 
 Eh  
 Why 
 Oh 
 Is there anything else 
 It says principle   
 OK 
 Yeah 
 Yeah fine 
 And to clarify that 
 I 've got another nasty little graph that I drew in a hurry  which plots out the   
 Yeah  
 Well I thought it was better than getting you lot to plot it out anyway  
 Cor 
 Yeah  
 But then we 've got to try and read it  
  
 Well you can always plot your own  drafts 
 You know  
 But that that that is the plot that goes with the second of the two analyses  no the first of the two analyses 
 Sorry 
 I 've only mentioned the first of the analyses 
 Hm 
 Mm 
 
  
 Now before you  uhm  break into groups and look at the results of the two analyses and try and see what 's going on  any any any sort of questions of clarification about what you 've actually been presented with  so that you really do know what you 're doing 
 Yes 
 Yeah 
 What 's it mean 
 
 Oh 
 You give the abbreviations at the heads of columns P E R C  
 Where 's this   
 
 I I know 
 Yeah per cent 
 Per cent 
 Oh 
 You know you 've got the colum they 're comp 
 First table principal axis inertia per cent cumulative per cent and a histogram  
 So if I just draw this out  
 
 All right 
 Yes  
 Simple 
 And then on the second table you 've got quality  mass  inertia 
  
 Yes 
 That 's noted on the back  
 That 's noted on the back 
 Mhm 
 Yes 
 That 's right 
 Oh there 's a note at the bottom too 
 Oh yes  
 You have 
 There 's a note at the bottom 
 Oh 
 what is it that inertia stands for   
 I mean uh wha what 's inertia in this context 
 Describes a pupil 
 In this context inertia is  is a combination of how much data we 've got and then how and how far away it is from the average 
 Describes a  
 Oh 
 Oh  
 I see 
 It 's it 's the  for the two 
 uh you did do that but it 's quite some time ago now 
 I 'll just look it up 
 
 
 Well it 's one times the other 
 It 's is is it 's the mass times some measure of the distant angle from the centre of the thing  
 centre of the block  
 So that something where the inertia is a lot higher than the mass which is something about freedom in distribution and something where the inertia is a lot is lower lower than the mass which is something which is a very average  
 Mm  
 Could you could you give the definition again so that I can write it down 
 Definition of inertia 
 Yes 
 About it 
 Y you said how much data plus 
 Now it 's  
 It 's mass times the distance from the centre if one 's being pedantic about it  
 Mhm  
 Times  
 
 
 
 It 's called inertia by analogy with uhm mechanics  where you have the inertia  of a spinning object for example  
 And  it it 
 I can remember going 
 In in the Science Museum there always used to be a machine where you had a had a whip and you turned it and there was a top to whip by hand 
 There 'd be a weight at each end  
 And there are two of these one steel weights and one with aluminium weights  
 And you turned it 
 And the steel weight it was very difficult to get it turning because the inertia was high and it 's a lot of work to get it turning 
 Once you do get it turning then you couldn't stop it  because the inertia with a heavy steel weight finds the distance it was from  wheel 
 The aluminium one was much easier because it had much less inertia because although it was just as far out the weight was less  
 But you could have had a steel one further in nearer the middle with the same inertia as the much lighter aluminium one further out 
 
 Mm  
 Ah   
 But it 's  
 But the way to look at it is if you compare mass with inertia inertia being a lot bigger mass things like A two 
 Inertia inertia mass gets very tacky sort of thing  right in the middle  
 I think that there 's one here 
 Let me see 
 Mm 
 Mm 
 I was just thinking about art because I was going to get back to painting after not doing any for a year and a half  
 So I was quite interested in the idea of what you could use instead of canvas and how uh you could use the thing that you paint on to be part of an environment or affected by the environment it was in  
 Because I 've been uh  
 I was going down to the Tate taking photographs of things that I couldn't buy postcards of like Sutherland 's Crucifixion  
 You had all these reflections in the picture and the picture is very much affected by its environment 
 The fluorescent lighting was cutting across the uh  crucified figure you know and uh disturbing the picture in some way 
 Mm 
 The glass over it 
 Yeah yeah 
 Mhm 
 And so I really 
 What I wanted to do was 
 the painting like was actually affected by its environment 
 so if it was hanging on an a white gallery wall then that would actually affect the painting 
 And if it was hanging on a piece of wallpaper that would actually affect the picture 
 The picture is part of environment that it 's actually in  
 So I decided to not use anything like glass because of the reflective value of it  and that that might interfere with the painting so I decided to use something that was  non-reflective and that would allow the light to filter through  
 So I used this uh mesh which is used for theatre design  called uhm  which is used for being painted on and uh being fronted back again to uh change the volume of in the painting  
 So in the painting like say the black one cos that 's the only one real one that 's been really been uh pushed anywhere yet 
 But the black one is uh 
 it looks sturdy in idea 
 and uh the thing about that is that  it 's still using natural light 
 the different uh 
 When it 's on this wall it 's just a solid because of the way it all works  
 it changes to a transparent if you 're in the light  
 so it 's just actually in uh 
 it 's using natural light of day  
 and then full of meaning the actual picture will change according to the light level  rather than the painting having its own kind of uh sense of light 
 In the painting say of  who painted the uh Mediterranean sun I mean the paint has no sense of light of its own really  
 Its light comes from natural light  
 That 's what illuminates it at the end of the day  
 So it looks different in a Mediterranean light than it would in uh an industrial tungsten light  
 And it doesn't have a light source of its own  
 But I mean all the it 's just something to playing about with the idea of the canvas  
 There 's no there 's no uh great message here yet because all I 'm worried about is colour and shape and uh testing that out on this fabric  
 Not really worried about making a great statement  
 Yeah 
 Just seeing them I mean 
 if I saw them somewhere without you know talking about them I mean I think I 'd think they were very much about uh sort of searching and  depths really  and  particularly the red one lots of uh suggestions of depth  
 It 's almost like looking into water somehow uhm  and as you say it would vary enormously on what you put it 
 Mm 
 Yeah 
 Exactly 
 But at the end of the day there 's no uh  
 The real space is the space between that gauze what 's that 's got the paint on it and the wall and that 's the space that 'll affect it at the end of the day  
 Mmm  
 And so  
 I mean do you are you making this work into a position of detachment 
 In other words you make it and  in a way you wouldn't maybe care where it went 
 No no that 's the whole point of it yeah 
 Yeah 
 So if somebody 's uhm depending on what their wallpaper is or there wherever it goes that could even make or kill the picture 
 Indeed 
 I mean seeing the uhm writing on the wall there relating to the  scribbling on the picture   
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah when I was hanging downstairs when I was painting it just had sort of yellow and pink paint behind it 
 and so it 's just completely different wherever it moves 
 Yeah  
 So rather more than being anything as I was reading it uhm about the spatial  it 's actually much more like context 
 Mm  
 I was interested in the fact that you could uh the only real space that you could you could perhaps make something there with paint 
 and there was no kind of painting space that you was were trying to get in it 
 but the only space you could get in the picture would be physical space  
 and that 's what would give it the sense of space you know  rather than using any kind of spatial contraptions or anything in your painting  
 You still uh use the sort of shapes that you 've still drawn on the material 
 Yeah 
 The material by itself has quite a lot of space that you draw on 
  
 Ah because of the  stretcher makes an edge 
 Yeah I mean it 's there 's on the border there 's a space there where the light 's going through the different materials which I quite like 
 and in particular the bright background colour that comes through  
 That 's why I like the idea of painting on a stretcher and having the stretcher you know be seen cos then it gives you a sense of its construction 
 But also you know there 's a lot of paintings you know 
 a lot happens at the edges of paintings doesn't it  and in a way that 's taken away from you isn't it here 
 Mhm 
 Mmm 
 I like the idea that you know you all the time you have that continual uh rectangle  in the picture so your rectangle could al would always be in it 
 So that 's why I 've been painting geometric shapes things that either set off or uhm kind of associate themselves with the rectangle that 's going all around the edge  
 I think without the  uh the sort of scribbling or the shapes that you 've added there 's a very strong sense of  in it 
 Yeah I  quite a bit 
 Mmm 
 That sort of uhm physical look to it  
 Do you think you need the sort of uhm  the scribbling or 
 No no no  
 No they 're just uh no really it is just it 's just getting back into painting at the end of the day  
 Mhm 
 Mhm 
 Do you think you need the gauze 
 Yeah  definitely need the gauze  but not necessarily need the marks that 've been made on the gauze at the moment   
 That 's the question uh I 'm thinking about now 
 It 's not well whether to paint on this thing but actually what to paint on it and what the marks are going to be 
 Yeah 
 Mm  
 I wasn't sure to what extent particularly on the black one to what extent the the the shape made in the middle or the scribbling were just sort of uhm  oh I don't know anti-art gestures really and a rather aesthetic  uh position you made for yourself there  
 I mean if one uhm an attempt to vulgarise it by being you know what could be a rather quite a serious sort of  scene as if one wanted to see  something like that 
 Cos the little one I feel your  seems to me again to be poised between I suppose aesthetics on the one hand 
 but the imagery often is just  
 Yeah that 's the thing about that black one 
 I was thinking today it looks like something from a Habitat house  
 Looks kind of too chic doesn't it  
 Yeah 
 Mhm 
 What the red one 
 No the black one  
 What do you think of them Chris  
   
 Well they 're not  well they may be a hundred miles from your work but they 're not a thousand miles from your work 
 It just doesn't    
 Trying to do something with  with the objective   
 I think the object stands 
 I think it 's like a a language that we build with 
 and I find it uhm  around a bit because of the nature of uhm 
 Could be a  storm in a teacup 
 I dunno don't know 
 Mmm 
 Well let 's talk about 
  cos I think it may be that we 'll come back to Don 's work  
 I 'm not talking about your work really 
 Uhm  why the light angle  
 That that was  I suppose a sign of frustration I suppose cos I had two canvasses working in a space 
 and uh I 'd seen something I wanted to re-present 
 and you need two canvasses   one on each wall 
 and uh 
 and then I pulled them out flat and then shoved them into a corner cos this is the way it would work in an abstract  you know 
 I felt that this term I was gonna going to play with some kinds of images 
 You know affected a lot by the environment and the economics of painting as well 
 I mean I realised I couldn't actually afford to  vinyl paints  what was going on here 
 Uhm  turns out you know as an experiment in which  pleasure as well  
 It was twenty quid for a pot of paint 
 Mm 
 Mm 
 A pot of paint cost twenty quid 
 Yeah 
 Pot of oil paint 
 I didn't realise 
 Well how big was it 
 I think the one I asked for was something like twenty three pounds 
 and he said   
 But it 's uh 
 Yeah I think that painting 's got a lot to do with the strictures of being in this place and working obsessively there 
 and uh you need a sort of  
 in a way working with those strictures and not being  
 I mean I find it ridiculous the things they 've told me  
  
 Yes 
 Can't you  
 Mm 
  
   is over 
 There 's quite a worrying one in the  for me 
 It means that you 're a  
 I think you 're going to have to change it totally that what you were working on originally is not how it 's gonna going to end up 
 And I thought of taking it out putting it out up there till   
 I mean I guess I was kind of frightened at what happened there cos I did actually  manage to balance them at one point 
 and I thought 
 it 's doesn't 
 either it 's not working or I 'm just uh  enough space  
 Mm 
 Mm 
 King Charles the Second has returned to England  and uh the restoration of the monarchy occurred in your work  
 No see the thing does exist cos I know I can  I can obliterate it 
 I think that 's why it 's there 
 Cos you can obliterate it 
 Yeah that 's how it comes out 
  paint the surface  always knowing that I could then  black it out again 
 Well in a way you 've made more decisions about the surface than you have been doing before  
 You seem to have committed yourself to some kind of you know pictorial sensibility  
 And I find I think the strongest thing about it is the fact that it 's in a corner in a way 
 It uh  the one surface is almost reflect a reflection of the other and of course it 's not true  a true reflection and uh  that gives it its you know dimension of originality  
 And uh I I 'm normally oppressed by such paintings but in yours I 'm not  
 It 's 
 That 's 
 What kind of statement are you making 
 Uhm  
 When you 're painting  are you thinking of things like well that bit of red seems to be a bit closer than the other bit of red 
 and  in front of the yellow  
 and think about gold 
 Yeah 
 Mm 
 I mean I 'm composing the painting uhm  but I  
  do as well  suspicious   
 Well where are  
 Well I 've got a feeling you share the  
 I mean I think this is quite a pleasant 
 I mean correct me if I 'm wrong 
 but there 's quite a lot of cynicism and suspicion in in  
 Mhm 
 But the barrier is you 're painting on a phenomena phenomenon that we can't see happen  that maybe doesn't happen 
 What you mean a phenomenon of the light 
 No your gauze 
 the gauze that can disappear and and then reappear 
 Uhm 
 Well then you 're dealing with the  that uhm 
 you 're dealing with the  that if you went into a gallery at a certain time of day or you went into a situation and it 'd look different  so  
 You know if you wanted to actually photograph it what do you photograph it on a white background wallpaper or whatever 
 How d' you represent them  
 Because there 's no one way of representing it at the end of the day 
 It just changes wherever it goes because it 's environment dependent the picture  
 Well  when you listen to a messenger telling you what happened on the mountain  you have the messenger 's speech  more or less uh being presented at the speed that you would expect of a piece of uhm a news bulletin or whatever 
 you know that that uh it 's like that 
 it 's like you listening to uh to the to the news bulletin 
 But of course it 's actually doing something more complicated because it 's also evoking for you a whole stretch of time uh which you are supposed to uh  which you imagine having taken place off stage 
 and you may link it with something that the chorus has been covering when it was singing one of its lyrics 
 So there 's a lot of manipulation going on of the audience 's sense of the happening uh of this play 
 and one thing that uh I find interesting is that that the dramatists both tragedy uh the tragedians and the comic playwrights tend to use the framework of the single day don't they 
 They say 
 in this day  uh X is going to find out who he is 
 or something like that as in the uhm Oedipus Tyrannus uhm Tiresius says 
 this day will bring you forth and destroy you when Oedipus says to  
 who are my parents 
 Uhm  i in fact the plays don't take a whole day 
 they take an hour and a half or or that sort of thing 
 But they give us the sense that the action that we are witnessing is concentrated into a single day or into a short  period that it 's more than just an hour or so  
 Uh and they give us that sense not because there is any sort of rule about unities  and that was a sort of latter-day re reading of Aristotle and we 'll come to that you know in Poetics 
 Uhm but it 's to concentrate the action 
 Now often that sense of everything having come to a head and going to be sorted out in the action of the play depends on  the  dramatist being able to evoke through the lyrics and through the narrative speeches of messengers and so on a sense of what has happened before that it 's all coming 
 Mmm also a sense of the audience that they have no control because things are happening at such a speed that you know that whatever is going to happen is going to happen at the end and the end is going to be very soon  happen 
 Yeah 
 Yes yes yes yes 
 and one of the things that a playwright needs to do is not only to give you a sense of danger and excitement and dramatic climax but also to give you some sort of shape of things to come isn't it so that you know how long you 're going to be sitting there for before you find out what happens to Oedipus 
 or 
 Uh in in broad terms you have something to expect 
 Uhm isn't a lot of this time though 
 it 's not only chorus 
 I mean like there are monologues at the beginning of speeches and also in the middle of speeches by some of the char by some characters who actually say that  say that whilst the scene 's been happening then this has been happening in say in the other part of the palace or somewhere else 
 Yeah yes  that 's right  that 's right but when they do that it 's like us listening to our neighbour who comes in and says I 've just seen an accident in the street  or a news bulletin over the radio 
 But when the the chorus is performing its lyric 
 Yeah the chorus don't 
 they tend to uh all make it as if it 's  what 's happening at that very time because they 're able to uhm mimic because they were trying to say mimic in voices so they would be able to mimic some of the voices 
 They some they sometimes do 
 Yes  or at least they can act out  uhm uhm when they recall something like the the duel between Heracles and Achivaras or  
 They can they can sort of evoke that uhm as a piece of timeless lyric so it seems  
 Uhm uh i it 's sort of uh  performed for us almost in the songs or dance 
 Yeah 
 Uhuhm 
 Also they might have been sort of symbolic movements to suggest sort of certain actions which the audience would understand 
 Yes 
 Yeah 
 And that is going on at the same time something else is going on uh 
 somebody can come in at the end of that chorus and say 
 oh uhm Herus has arrived 
 and here he 's got news about Heracles or whatever 
 and so it the chorus has this very peculiar kind of function of being able to cover  uhm  sort of unlimited amounts of of of time that are passing in the intervals between the the dialogue scenes  
 And it and it 's because they are using song and dance and the conventions of lyric that the audience can relate to that and feel perfectly comfortable with this interchange 
 and that 's the thing that for modern audiences is peculiar  isn't it  the the sort of formal interchange between ordinary uh uh dialogue exchange 
 and then these sort of uh  detached  lyric performances coming at fixed points during the during the play 
 Yeah 
 It 's also very useful isn't it because uhm it means that anything which really couldn't be staged any action then can simply be put in the choral  passages and like uhm well Odysseus 's and Silenius 's description of the uh how the Cyclops kills the sol the the sailors and how he eats them which really couldn't be performed on stage but is crucial 
 and in that way the sort of the satyrs are able to  mimic the fear of the 
 Yes yeah 
 Yeah yes yeah yes yes yes yes yes 
 Yeah and they can make it more vivid yes yes 
 It 's also easier to understand I mean what 's going on in the play 
 you know presumably I mean the audiences at that time knew all the legends and were all very familiar with the play 
 but it also gives you sort of the basis of understanding 
 Cos they give you a summary of what 's going on and who 's who or 
  so you know it 's easier  
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Oh I think there are a lot of ways in which 
 I mean after all when you think that you 've got a an audience of fifteen thousand people a lot of ways in which the play has to be very accessible  
 Uh you never know whether everybody there is going to know some of the background to a particular story 
 In any case each dramatist can change details of the story so long as you don't make  Orestes marry Clytemnestra or something like that 
 So long as you keep the broad outlines it 's clear that they do all sorts of things and they introduce  characters  
 Uh I mean just take the later plays  to illustrate that 
 So  there 's a lot of clarifying that needs to be done 
 and I think this point about the sort of  dramatic  enacting by the chorus acting out dancing and singing certain key moments in the background to the story is something that we should take into account 
 But with all the dancing and singing isn't it more a just a visual and uh an aural break anyway because the intensity of the dialogue so often is is quite heavy going 
 so it 's not quite light relief because in most of the tragedies it definitely isn't 
 but it 's uhm 
 a change is as good as a break in a way  
 and so a change in style is going to be keep the audience awake 
 Yes 
 Oh yes yes 
 I think that the uh uh the the lowest common denominator must be variety and uh relief and  aesthetic pleasure to be got from the song and dance and the last time we were talking  about the implications in New Comedy by the way for the changes of choral practice that instead of having a written out chorus  which is related to the themes of that play you get a musical troupe who comes along and does its  repertoire  uhm uh which may be a standard New Comedy repertoire that this particular group has for a number of different plays 
 Now uh that would provide uh the the the point that Eleanor has made that it satisfied the need for relief and variety and so on 
 But there was a long period when they seemed to think that there was more that you could do by making the chorus sing and dance things that were relevant to that particular play and only that play  like in the Agamemnon 
 I mean all fifth-century tragedy uh and uh the fifth-century comedy that we have the chorus each ode is evidently designed for that bit in the action 
 Then later they seem to have got a kind of multipurpose   
 Mmm 
 I I mean it was there purely as a uhm just a break 
 I meant it 's all part of that the same action it 's just as it 's a completely different style from the dialogues that you do far more with it that 's it  
 Yes  yes I see what you mean 
 You 're making a formal point yes yes 
 Giving the audience  time to think 
 It does 
 It wakes your senses up anyway if you 've got a whole load of some vast numbers singing and dancing 
 Yes  yes  
 Oh I think that 's true and and I don't think we should overlook that 
 I mean we tend to because we haven't got the the choreography  
 That 's one of our difficulties 
 It strikes me that there 's a fundamental difference say between sort of the uhm Old Comedy  choruses that they seem to all be a character in their own right 
 There are a lot of characters in their own right I mean particularly in The Birds where the  point out every particular bird but whilst uhm the ones in uhm sort of uhm tragedy  really don't seem to want to step out of the action a lot more easily 
 Yes 
 Yes 
 Oh yes  yes the particular  yes yes 
 Yes 
 More from watching the script 
 And they don't get individualised I mean 
 it 's true that in comedy not only do you have the different varieties of bird  in The Birds you also have in the  uh individual members of the chorus named  
 and in The Wasps 
 Now in tragedy you don't ever get in say the Oedipus Tyrannus  uh Oedipus saying oh hello X and how are you Y and this kind of thing 
 and that would seem quite inappropriate but it 
 and it 's partly to do with the notion of what is  the degree of decorum uh appropriate to tragedy isn't it that it 's more dignified if that group is not broken down into individuals  
 And so comedy is exploiting other sorts of possibilities that that aren't really  quite available to tragedy 
 I think that 's true 
 Yeah 
 Mmm 
 Mmm 
 Yeah and in The Wasps 
 Yeah 
 Mmm 
 Yeah 
 Mmm 
 Mmm in Old Comedy they don't seem to sort of like uhm mirror the emotions of the audience either in the same way that in tragedy they do 
 In tragedy there 's a definite sense that they uhm sort of play yeah they sort of bring out the emotions  or they emphasise what the audience should be feeling also predict  in certain ways uhm in in minor ways how the play is going to go  
 Things which are very covert  but which sort of suggest that 
 say  the play is going to take a sudden surprise and what they 're suddenly going to observe is going to be slightly different from what they might  have first thought 
 but it 's still a surprise when it happens 
 No 
  
 They speak they speak for the audience 
 Yes 
 Yes 
 Yes  a sort of guide yeah 
 Yes 
 Yes  
 What what was the example you had in mind 
 Well uhm sort of uhm just 
 I can't think of any particular ones at the moment 
 It 's something I was doing  
  but isn't there a part in uhm  in one of the uhm  
 in one of Aeschylus 's trilogy there 's a part where Iphigenia 's prophesysing prophesying what will happen and the chorus also  
 sorry yeah Cassandra and 
 and the chorus also uh  have a moment of prophecy  
 Cassandra 
 The chorus are often talking about themselves in the Agamemnon as if they were prophetic  uhm and they they use language about themselves  
 Uh they talk about their prophetic heart 
 Uhm when Agamemnon has gone in for example uh they they 're worried 
 they express their fears as if they were prophetic  
 but there 's a kind of irony because when Cassandra is offering them some much more hard uhm clear-cut uh predictions they 're saying we don't want prophets round here thank you very much because they 're afraid of the kind of things that she looks as though she 'll come out with  
 Uhm yeah there 's a there 's certainly some play in the Agamemnon with uh with the chorus 's attempt to interpret being expressed in in the metaphor of uh of prophecy 
 Right 
 So so you 're making a distinction between an executive summary within the executive report  is that right  
 OK 
 So within the executive summary you 're going to make a a pithy comment about or s synopsis of the  economic viability of the the project  
 and you 're also going to put the project in in relation to existing  demands for this particular uhm material 
 Yes 
 Yes 
 OK  
 So having established that part of the  design then what are you going to do 
 What are you going to do after you 've introduced the summary  
 What else  do you think needs to come out of the work that you 've done on the on the design  that it 's important to note  
 Things like timescale  or  
 Well you 've got your costing   
 Strikes me you you 're putting all the emphasis at the moment on on the costing 
 I think there are some other things that that came out of the design that uh were also important to note  
 Special features  
 By which you mean 
 
 How easy it is to get the equipment 
 
 Right 
 Well the the flow sheet with the equipment on it is just going to be uhm essentially a statement of what you require isn't it  
 But I suppose what I 'm trying to get at is just as with the economic analysis you said  
 this is the world market 
 and this is where we fit in  
 uhm  you ought to be saying  identifying if there are a any particular problems associated with the equipment or any particular technical  aspects associated with the equipment  
 So for example when you 've been looking at the design of your process are there any uhm  features of the equipment that you 've had to pay particular attention to  
 Are there any particular  issues associated with the production of penicillin which are perhaps you know perhaps make it different from other processes 
 What sort of things have you have you had to think about very hard in in the design process  
 Can anybody give me some ideas as to what those  features might be  
 I think what you need is some sort of list of what these fe features are in fact  
 Anybody going to ma get the ball rolling  
 The fermentor 
 OK but what about the fermentor 
 Is there anything particularly distinctive about that fermentor  
 Well it 's it 's the one equipment that we designed and I mean to detailed design and uh 
 OK but why did you design the fermentor  
 It 's the core of the process isn't it   
 Yeah  
 OK 
 Well that that 
 That needs to be specified more than any other piece of equipment 
 Right 
 OK 
 Yeah 
 As you say it 's right at the heart of the process isn't it  
 OK  
 Isn't it true to say that if you get the get the design of the fermentor wrong  the costing wrong then the rest of the process is is a little bit academic isn't it 
 Mm 
 Mm 
 Yeah  
 OK 
 So you would actually say I would have thought within your executive summary something to the effect that  your the detailed design work you 've done has been focused on one the the key element of the design uh sorry the key element of the process  which is the fermentor  
 Now what about you John 
 There are some particular details of that fermentor design which are  important  
 
 So  taking those points is there anything that within the penicillin process that you had to think about particularly carefully or that you 've actually put quite a lot of thought into  in terms of the design of the fermentor  
 It 's 
 
 Right  
 OK 
 So one first off is the influence of the of the organism type on the fermentor design 
 Yeah 
 Good  
 Can you think of any other categories which come out from that 
 There are some other properties of the organism aren't there 
 What about the  the rheology of the broth 
 Does that make a difference to the way in which the fermentor is designed or and operated  
 You 're nodding your head  Victor 
 What what particular problems does the fermentation broth  pose 
 I think relatively high power requirement  cos of the  
 Right  
 OK 
 So what I 'd be looking for then in that section would be for you to pick out those details that you think are  peculiar or or particularly important to the design of the penicillin process  features which mean that you couldn't have just gone and bought a bog standard  fermentor off the shelf from somewhere else and just expected it to work  
 OK  
 But at the same time are there other things that you need to put in the des in the executive summary  related to  errors which have still got question marks over them  
 I mean are there still some problem areas I mean on the design  apart from the entirety of the thing  
 Can't think of anything offhand  
 Surely if you went back over the design now you would and looked for the number of times you used the word assume  it 'd be those assumptions which would be the things things that you 'd need to pick out in your executive summary because clearly where you 're making an ex an assumption there 's a  you know there are question marks aren't there 
 You 're having to make certain  uhm  guesses or estimates of of of the properties of the fluid or or  making estimates as to the way in which the process is going to perform 
 So are there any particular areas which are  more prone to you know have got more guesses in than than in other areas  
 Mm 
 The recovery process  
 Mhm  
 Yeah 
 But that 's a pretty big term isn't it 
 I mean that 's two thirds of the process is is recovery 
 Are there any 
 Could you be a bit more specific than that 
 Could you home in on 
 Mm 
 Yeah 
 Polishing stage and uh  broth extractions 
 OK  
 So you could again then identify that there are particular elements of the downstream process where  you had presumably insufficient design data on which to base your design  
 and you could go further than that and s and perhaps make some recommendations that those would be the particular areas that you 'd require to to invest some more research and development in it to to actually tighten up on the cal calculations in those areas  
 Uh I think that 's quite an important point isn't it that maybe when you come up with these areas where there are question marks and you 've made key assumptions that those are perhaps the  you need to try and relate those assumptions and the the errors in that area those areas back to the economic sensitivity analysis 
 So for example you could say  
 if the downstream processing calculations were are in error by a certain amount then this would be we can accommodate tho those sorts of inaccuracies because within our sens our sensitivity analysis has shown that the project is in fact viable with plus or minus ten per cent or plus or minus twenty per cent  error  
 Why do you think it 's important to try and tie the  tie those two together  
 Or do you think it 's important to tie the two together 
 That 's the meaning of the sensitivity 
 Yeah 
 I in relation to    
 And also like cost estimation  
 It 's not a completely   calculation 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 It it 's not it 's not acc it 's not an accurate thing 
 You 're dealing with a feasibility study which is plus or minus thirty per cent  at best perhaps even  plus or minus three hundred per cent  
 Uhm  but you you 've got to sh try and show that the the bits where you 're plus or minus three hundred per cent are not critical to the overall success of the project  
 Is that right 
 Yeah 
 OK  
 What about aspects of the uh  plant layout or the way in which the actual process is going to run 
 Are there any key details that need to come out of that that you need to report in your executive summary  
 
 Sorry 
 
 Toxic 
 
 Well where does toxicity come from 
 
 Yeah 
 Right 
 OK 
 So I think within the executive summary you ought to be making a statement about the way in which you approach the design 
 What 's the design philosophy in terms of the layout  
 You know you 've made a distinction between flameproof areas and non-flameproof areas and you need to justify that as well 
 You need to explain why you 've done that 
 What are the advantages  of dividing the area like that  
 Does the production of penicillin impose any particular constraints on the sort of land we can use 
 I mean if I 'm going to look for where I 'm going to site this plant are there is there anything that I 've got to have available  
 Does it have to be near near a water source for example  
 Does it have to be near a supply of lots of electricity 
 Are there any other constraints sort of geographical types of constraints that you can think of  
 You need water  uhm in cooling  
 You need water   
 Electricity    
 Right 
 What 's the other thing you need to have in order to operate this process  
 Availability of materials  
 OK 
 Availability of materials 
 But there 's something else even more 
 Manpower 
 Right 
 Manpower  
 Have you thought at all about the  nature of that uh  labour force  about the composition of that labour force  
 I mean how many people are you going to require to run this plant  
 Any ideas John  
 
 And on what on what basis do you assume two hundred 
 
 
 Right 
 It 's a continuous process 
 I i it 's a moot point 
 but I I I think uhm you probably wouldn't be able to get people to work effectively for up to twelve hours 
 so I think you 'd have to have a three-shift day 
 otherwise you 'll have people falling asleep on the job  
 But is this plant going to be uhm highly automated or not  
 And what implications does the level of aut does the level of automation have on therefore the  the level of man manning and the sort of manning you require  
 More computers 
 Less people 
 Right  
 So what sort of process have you got here  Victor 
 tell me 
 It 's a process 
 An automated process 
 Yes 
 OK  
 So then what are the implications  
 Are you really going to have around two hundred people like John has on his penicillin plant 
 or are you going to  try and get away with fewer 
 Uh fewer  
 OK  
 But something 's going to happen I think 
 If you go towards a more automated plant I think the nature of the skills that the people will have will be different  apart from the fact that they 'll need to be able to stay awake like hyenas    
 What sort of people are you going to be employing  if it 's going to be an automated plant 
 Uh skilled people  
 So now does that make a difference 
 If I decided I 'm going to put this plant in a Third World country is it going to be as easy for me to find  relevant personnel as as it is if I 'm going to put it in a developed industrialized country like uh this one 
 No  
 You might do 
 
 Right 
 So you need to think carefully about the  the quality and the sorts of training these people would have had in order to to be able to be competent to run your process don't you  
 But it 's not on a green field site no this plant  
 I can't remember 
 Was was it a green field site or or was it adjoining an existing  
 Yeah 
 It 's joining an existing plant 
 OK 
 But have we said what that existing plant is doing  
 No 
 Except 
 And it may be old technology as well mayn't it 
 So I I think you need to raise the question at the board level don't you 
 Yeah 
 So uh you 've got somewhere within this exec executive summary a statement to the effect that this process will require this sort of level of manning  uh by these sorts of people  and for these reasons we believe that it will require to be situated  in a certain  s sort of location  in certain having access to certain sorts of people  
 I think John your two hundred 's an order of magnitude out  
 I should think the number of people who would actually run a run a process like this would be really quite small 
 But you 'd need to think carefully about the number of support people required to actually administer  a process like this 
 Because you 're going to be producing material for clinical use  eventually there 's going to be quite a lot in terms of quality assurance and backup  uh taking samples  those samples in in a laboratory in laboratories
