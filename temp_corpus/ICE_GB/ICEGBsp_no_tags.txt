
OK Adam uhm  what did you see as missing from other  activities for the disabled which might have  got you into starting this group 

I think the main things that I saw as  as absent from disa from work with with disabled people was

Sorry could you start again

OK

Did you not 



Ten second

medium speed

Three two one

OK 

So what did you see as missing from other  types of activities for the disabled  which might have influenced you into  starting this group 

I think the m  the main perception that I had of of  what what was described as integrated work was that the the contributions from  able-bodied people and disabled people were often  uhm  unbalanced 

Uhm something that I I saw a lot was  that when people were  uhm 

I 'm blanking



Can I can I can we take that again

Yes 

Excuse me I 've got to do what I did last time

I hate this

I 've got to get this out

I won't be a second Richard

I 'm just going to go berserk for a while

and I 'll then start again 

Ah  thank you  

Can we dance for a bit actually 

OK Adam 

What personally do you get out of the integrated dance 

I think that the  what I get out of integrated dance is uhm is exactly the same  in many ways as what I get out of other forms of dance

Uhm  the difference  I think the main difference that I feel  uhm in the work that we are doing  uh  at the moment is that  what sets it apart is that  there is a sense that nobody is left out of this group

This this is a dance group which does not exclude people

Uhm  and I think one of the things that I felt when I was studying dance  was I very much enjoyed the work that I was involved in

I enjoyed the the time that I was given to to study and to explore

But I also had a feeling that uhm  that that there were two strands

One was that I was being given the opportunity to  uhm  learn and develop  uhm physical skills 

The other was that this was  in some ways isolated that  the dance world or the world that I was working in and studying in was  in many ways very removed from  the rest of life a and from from all sorts of other people 

And so I had I had the feeling that here were people learning to use their bodies learning to develop a physical language  uhm 

and yet that language was being channelled into a very narrow  field

and  the the  the opportunity tha that has arisen through the group that we 're w we 're working with now is that those  movement skills are  uhm are allowed to be used to communicate  rather than to develop a a a narrow band of activity that only certain people can be involved in 

Uhm  the movement language that 's being developed is one which involves different people with different skills to talk to each other 

Uhm and I think f for for myself  that 's where the great the greatest enjoyment comes from 

It 's about being able to communicate and relate to th to to anybody that comes into that class

That 's the challenge uhm

How how was it  relating  to disabled people in the beginning 

Presumably you 'd never danced  in an integrated thing like that 

How was it  your initial reaction  towards each other

Uhm

Well  to begin with uh I s the the initial work was was the work that I do with Celeste and  uhm that work  that was work that we set up before we actually opened the class

We decided that we would work together  and and  find out whether whether what our what our thoughts  told us were right could actually be done

So uhm that was an interesting period in which uhm  I I was  brought up t I was br  I was brought to

Let 's stop it for the moment

Let 's stop for the moment shall we

How do the able-bodied members  of the Mike Heafy group feel about working with the disabled people 

I think that would be  that 's going to be different for every able-bodied dancer

And and I think the question can  is  is bigger than that  because it 's from both sides

I think that the problems of working together  are not just for the able-bodied people  coming to work with disabled people but equally for disabled people coming to work with with able-bodied

Having said that  uhm  I can really only say how it was for me when I came to work

I 'm aware of  the things that other s the students members of the group say 

uhm certainly when I first came to work with Celeste  uhm  I was I found myself confronted by  uh  what what I looked at as as the disabling effect  that a wheelchair has on on a non-wheelchair user 

so  the the word disability which is this  nebulous thing that that exists somewhere between the two people  uhm  has has a part on each side

There is the part that that I feel is how do I get to dance  with somebody who is in a wheelchair

And for a while  that  awkwardness existed  uhm 

But then through experimenting through through trying things out we gradually overcame our awkwardness our embarrassment uhm  our reluctance to try things our fear of doing anything that might in any way endanger the person uhm in the chair uhm that might endanger me as a as a as an able-bodied person 

Uhm  and by working very slowly and gradually uhm developing a trust in each other uhm we were able then to move into much more exciting work 

And I think that 's very much  the pattern for people coming to  the group uhm o or when people hear about the group and say

I 'd like to but  I 'm just not sure about a i what how I could  how I c how how I can dance what I can do 

Uhm  so I think there is there 's a a difficulty an initial difficulty uhm but I think that very very quickly goes and people  uh begin to dance with each other

Mm

How do they see it within each other

Uhm does everyone view it as just being involved in dance o 

or is it that some people just see it as  being involved in therapy or 

Some peo I think some people come initially to  to  help people in wheelchairs dance

That 's the they hear about this group where people in wheelchairs are dancing and they think oh I 'd like to help those people dance

Uhm

But I think they very those people are very quickly  disabused of that uh  of that notion uhm  because the requirement from them will be that they dance  that primarily they have to find a way to dance themselves

and when they when they 're dancing and when they 're moving and they have some kind of physical language  then they can begin to dance with people in wheelchairs

The people in the wheelchairs in the group are all very already very proficient dancers uhm

so it 's very often  the able-bodied people coming who have to  let go of certain notions 

So is it you see it as art  as another dance  form within its own right 

Absolutely

Uhm  that 's not to say that there aren't  in inverted commas therapeutic  side effects or therapeutic effects from from from from from the dance 

But  that 's a natural part of of art 

And it 's it 's it reflects a

I 'm rambling

Let 's just stop there

Mm

No

That was good

OK 

I was I saw myself launching off into a philosophical treatise 

I was lucky 

Speed

Speed 

Uhm  do you find  a lot of difficulty in getting finance  for the project 

Uhm  currently the the class runs uhm on a subscription so that people that come to the class pay for the class uhm

And that was a conscious decision that Celeste and I took when we set the the class up that it was going to be  a dance group and a and a uh eventually a performance group uhm that it wasn't a charity and that it wasn't therapy 

and therefore people that were coming we would expect them to pay

just like any other dance group we would be self-financing 

Uhm having said that uhm the Mike Heafy Centre have given us the use of uhm  the the the hall there once a week uhm which which means that the the pressures on us are slightly reduced

Uhm 

Yeah 

What wou what more would you like to see in the way of uhm  this type of activity being  you know more institutionalized in colleges or  more of an a well-known

Yes

I think at the moment there 's there 's a  a lot of awareness within  uhm within the teaching world within uhm educational establishments that dance can be a wider uh  can have a wider  influence and use than it 's currently having

Uhm  now having said that  at the same time the dance institutions  are still very restricted

You either study pure dance  or you study dance therapy  uhm and there seems to be no connection between the two 

Uhm  what is a common occurrence is you 'll have somebody coming into a college to do a workshop on work with the disabled or dance with the disabled and you 'll go along to that that workshop and it would be full of able-bodied students  who are on the course wanting to find out about how you do  this new thing

Uhm there will be no disabled dancers in the class 

Now  this highlights the at the moment the the  polarised uhm situation that you have a dance world that is becoming aware  of the scope of dance  uhm and yet has very few  inroads has really made very few inroads into getting anybody with disabilities in studying on their dance courses

Most of the places aren't accessible uhm 

The teachers aren't perhaps aware of how they can work with the disabled student 

So at the moment  uh disabled dancers are still  sh shut out of the dance world 

Uhm  they may be allowed into dance therapy

but why should they want to study dance therapy more than  an able-bodied dancer

Right 

Let 's move on to uhm  what independent dance or dance  of this nature offers the other  activities which would normally be associated with the d disabled people what more

what do you think this offers 

I think 

I 'd like to answer that in a s in a slightly different way

Uhm I showed  uh a sp a a video of some of the work we 'd done to some of my college students who are on a dance course

And  uhm their response was  uhm very positive uhm 

but they sp we are not sure how we could what we could do

you know what can we do

Uhm  and  it transpired that none of the none of the students in that group that I was talking to  had met or had any involvement with anybody with a severe disability 

Uhm  so  one of the things that that the group offers is  is a meeting of people  who have been in some way segregated and falsely segregated uh that these people with disabilities are somehow placed to one side and we the able-bodied get on with our physical activities  which are separate 

Uh I was  I mean I wasn't shocked that the that the the students had not met people with disabilities or people in wheelchairs  uhm 

Many of us don't 

Uhm so one of the things that that happens in the class is there is this meeting place of of  almost two separate worlds  and  the the communication between those worlds is  powerful and moving uhm 

Can you tell me how did you both get involved in the Mike Heafy project 

Shall I go first

Yes

Well I got involved through Celeste who  I used to dance with with London Contemporary  going back  twenty years or so 

And uh she told me that she was starting this class with Adam and uh  asked me if I was interested and I said yes it sounded interesting

Uhm it 's nice for me to do something where I 'm moving  because I teach now

I teach dance but I don't get the chance always to be in a class

So I thought this is an interesting  uhm idea of bringing disabled and abled together and uhm  it was a chance for me to explore movement myself out of the context of a a uhm dance class  or m so much of a technical class where I because I teach more technique  now  so

And and I got involved because I went to college to Middlesex Poly with Adam and finished last June and haven't really done any dance since then 

And he was he told me about it and I wa was really interested particularly because he was saying that  it was a lot of a lot of the leaning was going to be towards choreography and that was my particular interest

I  I really didn't like technique

I mean I 'm too lazy really for that I think  and that was my  interest in it

That 's how I sort of got started in it

Is this the first time both of you  have been involved in disabled people in dance 

Yeah for me

Yeah

Uh I 've worked a little bit with mentally disabled 

But uhm I it 's uh more working with other people

I haven't really taught them directly

I 've just been involved in classes 

That 's all

What do you get out of it as compared with working with  uhm able-bodied people or whatever in a normal dance sense 

Uhm  well I think I think it 's interesting because there 's limitations put on what you 're able to do and it 's finding ways around those limitations

And I think when you 're  choreographing  uhm with very able-bodied people particularly because I 'm used to  working  with very able-bodied people who are capable of doing more or less anything you ask  then uh you don't have those restrictions you uhm  whereas within this particular class you there are limitations

and it makes it fa in a way far  easier I 'd say to be able to create because  you can't go off at in all tangents or in e every direction

You do have to keep yourself controlled within the within the uhm structure and I think that 's that 's an interesting way of working 

And it also makes you so aware of your own ability  and other people 's abilities  and how the body works whereas  uhm when you 're uhm working with a very able-bodied people you become very blas&eacute; about it I think and you forget  how complicated the body is and how  wonderful it is to be able to move certain parts and ways of doing it and the various different ways you can do it and even when you can't actually  uh you aren't capable of moving how you can get around those problems and become capable of moving

I think that 's fascinating 

Mm

So it 's not necessarily uhm uhm a hindrance

Mm

Oh no no no well no no

No not at all not at all

It 's it 's fascinating

I find it fascinating

Uhm

But uh you you were saying that working so closely with other people that 's definitely true because it really means that you listen  with your body I suppose to to to people that you 're working with  and that 's of as you were saying you become blas&eacute; about that

Uhm

often you you d you don't do that because  in a way you you don't have to in other situations

Uhm

Uhm

There has to be a l a greater sensitivity  to that person because it 's very easy  uhm to hurt someonedy somebody who has a disability because they haven't got so much control

so you have to be very very sensitive to their particular  uh disability in order to s stop them from damaging themselves

And I think that really brings you closer 

Uh able-bodied people can always turn and save themselves where a disabled person might not be able to 

And I think that that closeness uhm makes a a more interesting choreography 

Uhm

Have your attitudes changed toward towards disabled people  since both of you come becoming involved in this

have you consciously been aware 

I think it 's it 's uh more of an increase in awareness really  rather than a change in attitude

Uhm

Uhm 

Yeah definitely 

Definitely

Uhm

And within the dance field that you were both  in before this  uhm  would you say the attitude is is fairly  uhm  rigid towards no not even thinking about including disabled people

Oh yes sure

Definitely

I mean it 's

I think there 's I think there 's a greater awareness

there is becoming a greater awareness far more so  uhm than there has ever been

When

I I stopped dancing I guess about  six seven years ago with the company  and we didn't at that time we used to go out  uhm and do small performances around and work with the local people in the areas we were  in doing residencies 

And we very rarely at that time worked with disabled

But now it 's  almost always when the company do go out the company I was with do go out they do work with disabled

and it has become a a much greater part of of of the of the work that they do and I think uhm 

so I think there is a greater  awareness of it in general much greater

Uhm

Uhm

But on o  on other levels I mean  you c you 're there aren't

How many classes are there that disabled people can go to  you know I mean i just in terms of access

and that 's one of the main p the main things  that that prevents that  I 'm sure

Uhm uhm

Uhm uhm

Uhm uhm

Uhm

That 's right

That 's not enough obviously but uhm 

Uhm

Did you uhm both feel awkward  in the beginnings  as in what the expectations were of  the disabled people you were working with and theirs of your  of you uhm 

Uhm

I don't know that awkward  is the word

Uhm  I felt quite ignorant 

But then t the only way to get over that is to is to  to find out really  so

Uhm

I think when you start working in a new class like that everybody is ignorant

You don't know what to expect and I think we 're all in the same situation  uhm uhm uhm

Well yeah yeah

That 's the thing anyway I mean wheth wheth

when you 're working with someone whether they 're disabled or able-bodied you 're still  it 's still new to work with them and to learn to trust them and learn to  sort of have contact with them 

Uhm

I mean I I suppose that is awkward but then that that is awkward anyway 

Uhm

So you you 're both interested in performing  within this integrated  dance group yeah

Uhm uhm

Uhm uhm 

That appeals to you both 

Uhm

Yes

Uhm 

And for the future would you want to continue  with this group



Yes

Well yes certainly

Uhm uhm

For  however long it

Well we 'll see what happens really

It 's all I mean it 's all very exciting really

We don't know  what will happen but  we can only sort of work and see what happens

And it 's a it 's a very nice group to be working with because I think everybody it 's not too large  it 's uhm and everybody

you do get to know everybody quite well 

And it it becomes like a little family organisation  and uh  that 's nice 

I think that 's what everybody  hopes for  within a working situation  uhm

Uhm uhm

Uhm

Can you tell us how you first got involved in this project 

Uhm well I knew Adam from  last year when he was at college and I saw uhm  his poster up about the group 

I thought oh that sounds exciting interesting and when I heard that some other people from college were going to go along  and yeah I thought  I 'm going to go 



Has it been a ne a new experience working with disabled people I pres

I presume this is the first

Well I 'm actually involved in an integrated youth group uhm called Unity uhm  which is  just a general youth group  uhm for everybody  uhm  so  the disability side of it is not new for me uhm it 's just

but working  in this group uhm  it 's  different in terms of uhm  the way  that you have to dance

Actually you have to be much more honest about what you 're doing  uhm





Hold it for a moment 



Wh what do you personally get out of  this particular dance 

Uhm  it  I find that I have to  be more honest about the way that I work uhm 

in a lot of other contact-based dance work you can actually cheat and not  give your weight fully or uhm take weight fully  and it becomes a bit  sort of nothingy whereas with this you 've really got to  put your whole body  into it and you can't sort of just be thinking  sort of intellectually on the side thinking

oh yes this is a really good idea 

You 've actually got to find out what you 're actually doing 

Uhm so as a dancer it 's already given me a lot 

How do you see  yourself being involved in in the group in the future

do you want to continue into the performance

Yeah I will

I 'm graduating in June uhm  so  it 's given me some direction already

I definitely want to  perform with a group and also  do some choreography f for my final assessment uhm 

On this group

With this group yeah uhm 

so  I think i i it 's generally  kind of become a bigger part of  of life really because I 've got nothing else

How do you like to see this type of dance uhm  being more publicised and  you know spread further amongst different colleges 

Uhm  I think that one of the main points about this type of dance  is that it is a form of dance

I it 's contact work uhm

and the disability side of it is  uhm  secondary really that

if you 're working honestly with your body and with your weight uhm then it doesn't matter who 's involved uhm 

Therefore I think that 's  that working with people with disabilities  means that as I was saying before that you have to be  uhm more honest about what you 're doing  uhm 

but it is a form of dance which already exists uhm which is spreading  already to other colleges 

But I think  making people aware that  anybody can do it  uhm  is  is quite important uhm because it it is still it is very much people who are already studying dance  that suddenly found contact work  uhm 

but it 's s there for so many more people 

I think that just about does it really because we 've covered 

Hol hold on

One more thing

one more thing

We 've got from the Mike Heafy  uhm that that you 're working closely with is it Dindy

Dindy

Yeah

Uhm

Is it Dindy

Yeah

So uhm just say something about that so that we can  have some voice over f f for the work that you were doing

Can you remember what you were doing when you were there filming 



Uhm  yeah I wasn't doing very much I remember I wasn't there

What was av what was available to you  prior to the work that you 're doing now 

What sort of activities physical activities were available

Well I suppose uhm the  the standard kind of physiotherapy  when you asked for it  uhm  and well sports I guess 

But  I mean I 'm not necessarily interested in doing sports

and just because I became disabled  it doesn't mean to say that I suddenly had a surge of interest in  going to play  uhm I don't know basketball or anything 

And actually at my level  of injury  certain sports I would think are  would not be you know accessible to me 

Uhm  I like to watch sport 

I I enjoy watching it but

and I enjoy any kind of physical exercise  that is you know stretching or uhm  working out  building on muscle

but i it 's uhm

it sort of  stops there  uhm

With working now in movement and dance  you can use all that 

You need as much as you you know you can  you need some strength  to to

Oh this is terrible sorry 

Right well 

Uh  OK

Uhm  why do you think physiotherapy is really  important

Is it important

Is physiotherapy important for someone

It 's very important very important and

and what happens I think is that  uhm while you 're for instance like me as a spinal injury you have physiotherapy 

all the time that you 're there  you 're having to build up the muscles that you  you have got working for you because  to push a wheelchair is you need muscle power  uhm

and I always had preferred to  to push my own than to have an electric one 

Uhm  and really you need it all through your life

I mean it doesn't mean to say that when you leave hospital  that 's it 

You know I I think you still need to go back uhm  maybe do something at least once a week

but that 's not always available  because there 're so many people who need phi physiotherapy 

Uhm so what I 've always tended to do is to do my own stretches at home 

And I have a  a m a machine

It 's called a a what 's it called oh God  called sorry 

Can we stop a bit I 

Oh God

Yes let 's leave that 

Let 's leave that

Yeah that 's not that 's not very interesting though



No that 's all right we 'll we 'll

we 'll move on 

We think we 've got the main point about that

Uhm 

unclear-discussion

Yes  uhm  what is the Mike Heafy centre 

How did it come about

How did it start

Uhm

It started uhm  because  well quite  by chance uhm 

God this is hard too how it started 

The 

Who was Mike Heafy

Oh right

Mike Heafy  uhm was a man who worked  uhm for Allied Dunbar 

And  he died  in his  forties quite recently  and uhm  Allied Dunbar were keen to  to  either name a building or uh some kind of memorial to him

He was  apparently a very popular  person uhm

And I suppose Aspire at the time the charity uhm were thinking  of an idea of of building an integrated sports centre  and rehabilitation and arts and leisure centre which was  uhm attached to the sp London Spinal Unit  uhm in Stanmore

and  I think Allied Dunbar thought it would be as Mike Heafy was interested in sport  it would be uhm  a great thing to put his name to

And they have supported and  you know greatly funded  the building of it  and uhm  the rest was you know by public donation  uhm built this two million pound sports centre which was uhm designed by an architect who who himself was a a paraplegic 

And so it 's  totally accessible  for anybody 

Uhm it 's linked to the Spinal Unit so that  patients from the Spinal Unit can  uhm associate with  the public and get back into  life all the more quicker because of the contact with  with people  instead of just you know the  the hospital staff and other patients 

Think it 's a a vital  need 



Will it uhm will it run out of money 

Will it uhm will it run out of money 

or is it safe

Has it got a safe future

Well no

I it 's not a safe future

I mean  I 'm I can't tell you exactly what  how much the the government give

but for instance the twenty-four hour marathon we did  we 've just completed that was raising uhm hoped to raise about ten thousand pounds

and you know we need to  to to make to fund running costs for each year

I mean it is Aspire 's job is to raise money  for not only the Mike Heafy centre but for research  uhm  which you know

there 're many projects that they have on hand  uhm 

and also yes to to to to fund the Mike Heafy centre where  it doesn't generate its own funds

But I mean it 's working extremely well and I think  hopefully that will continue 

With this uhm  does this the kind of work that you and Adam and the group are doing go on outside of that sort of

I mean can it go on

could it go on without that context 

Is that how much is that context  uhm necessary for that work to  to happen 

D' you mean  having the space there and uh

Yes

Absolutely

Uhm or whatever they provide

Uhm  well they I mean they they do  things like aerobics and  basketball  uhm and they have a a whe a wheelchair  team of basketball players uhm

But th I don't know 

I don't think there 's much integrated classes going on at the moment

That 's what they 're trying to do I mean

And really it 's the interest from the  disabled people in the community  who want to join in

They 're the ones who  will have the voice and and to go in and want to join the classes 

Uhm but then you still have to have  the teachers and the instructors who are able to  uhm adapt  movement for those people

And I think that 's you know I think people need  uhm skills for doing that and uh  I think Adam certainly has those skills for for our group  uhm

And the work that I 've done with him  in the early stages has uhm  I think helped  a lot I think

It 's you know  I think it was quite some of it was quite new to him

so  I mean we 're both 

we 're all of us building on that now  and uh  taking away the the obstacles I think

You know wheelchairs can be seen as obstacles but they 're also  amazingly mobile and  they can be quite sculptural  things to have on on a stage or  whatever

In the early uhm stages when I was there uhm there was quite a lot of use of the wheelchairs and it 's quite uh  apparently risky  mo movement involving tipping wheelchairs over and rolling out of wheelchairs  and so on

Uhm

Uhm

Now more recently the work that I 've seen seems to 've been away from the chairs  and uhm exploring a different dimension of movement

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Well I Well I think it 's

Uhm   in the early stages it is important to ex explore  yourself

and  contact with other people out of the chair because as as you know it can be  uhm  used as a uh an interesting element of course but i it 's also  good t for people who are in wheelchairs to actually get out

It 's such it 's a freedom in a way although it 's sort of a a contradictory thing to say because out of my chair I cannot move across the room

In my chair I can get there fairly quickly

But it 's the sense of freedom of being able to just lie down if you want to roll over 

It 's it 's liberating in that in that in that way 

and uh  to be able to use somebody else as a support rather than your chair  or f for for you to be a support to someone else which is to somebody able-bodied which is even more interesting 

Because uh I think  some able-bodied people  may think we can be too fragile to touch  to push over  to tip out of our chairs

but  if we say what we 're what we 're capable of and people are careful I mean  I don't think it 's that risky

I think it 's exciting 

Yes

Is is there anything else that  is there some is there anything else that 's that you found particularly valuable about  this work 

I think yeah I think uh  I think it 's it 's a way of giving  as well

I mean  I think  we 're all used to taking 

I mean it it sounds   sounds a bit holy doesn't it really 

No but I mean it 's it 's very good to  to share  things with people  and to share what you know  and to  to learn what  other people can give to you and what you can give to them 

And it 's

I don't know

I I I really  love it

I I look forward to  to working each week

I I mean I 'd like to do it every day  but you know such is life 

And the physical contact  out there is the is the only  problem of being isolated in your  wheelchair

Uhm

Uh uh in a in a chair

Uhm

I think so

Yes

I mean I think uhm space is you know I mean  you know just the obstacles that you have in a room 

You know I mean  in in my lounge I have a place where I sit if I 'm not going to get out of my chair

It 's like my corner

and I often think  you know

here I am sitting in my corner 

uhm everyone is sort of on a seat somewhere else

And yes i it 's like you know you have this little frame around you 

And I mean  I think that  it 's not the first contact I 've had with people

but whenever Adam and I hug and say hello he sits on my knee and he you know he puts one leg on either side and we hug and we 're close physically 

Normally when people hug you you 're sort of hanging on the side somewhere you know

and you 're sort of  neck craned

and you know it 's not comfortable

it 's not a warm  thing

If you give and take when there 's that close bodily contact  it 's great 

And you know we  there 's a lot of that happening 

Uhm  uhm I think that 's that 's good it

it 's necessary 

You can't communicate with people  solely  through  you need 

you need physical contact too  in everyday things not  uhm  not just once in a while  I think 

Can you cut there 



First of all  uh how do you see the future of the group 

Uhm  well we 're sort of working towards our first performance  which will  be  not just Vicky 's uhm choreography

but we 'll hopefully be able to do  two others that we 're working on  and  also to do a workshop  that day and uhm a talk with the students at the Middlesex  uhm

and then hopefully  we will get some more pieces together  and uhm then see where we can perform 

Uhm  personally I I would like to  to do that very much 

Uhm  I always keep saying I wish it had start

I wish I 'd got involved  ten years earlier because you know  I 'm getting old

 and uhm  you know I mean 

There you go

you see I am talking about the stereotype dancer 's  life aren't I life span of of dancing

but uhm I don't know I

I think I would like to go on as as long as I feel that I 'm enjoying it and  and informing  giving people other people pleasure  in seeing our work

And and maybe  I 'll be more experienced then to take on a more  uhm uh a more of a teaching role 

Uhm  but we 'll just have to see how how it goes I mean 

But it 's certainly  at the moment it 's it 's my the biggest interest in my life  right now 

So uhm  what  what was your interest in the visual arts

I mean were you pursuing that at Middlesex Poly 

Well when I was uh  studying for my degree I was doing a joint a  a joint course  part of which was visual arts or fine art and part of which was dance 

Uhm  what I found happening  over the period of study was that  I began to bring those two areas together so that  uhm the work that I was doing in the in the fine art part of the course was beginning to spill over  both in terms of  choreography and also in terms of  art work  in relation  to people moving 

Uhm  I think one of the the  the most interesting areas about  uhm that relationship between art and dance  is  that very often artists are involved in a very private  uhm personal  investigation and that they work in a very solitary way 

And the  curious and delightful thing about working with a dance group is that  it 's a bit like opening doors of the studio  and  having people come in and actually have  those people involved and engaged in in your work

Uhm  so for somebody involved in  the visual arts it 's a very liberating process to suddenly be  going public in a way working with ideas of movement and shape and form  but with people rather than on your own 

Uhm 

So do you see the stage as a canvas 

I think it 's much more than that

I mean I I think  in a very simp in a simple way yes but it 's more than that

It 's it 's a a space in which  uhm people can  interact and  uh  feed off each other and and I can hear voices coming out from all over the place

I 'm hearing voices  

Yeah

Anyway uhm  yeah 

All right

Just an aside there

Uhm the voices are coming over quite loud over the cans

Can can you speak bit quieter Steve maybe

Be easier for Adam to concentrate 

Did you catch that

Did you catch it 

OK

You can hear him all right can't you 

Speak to us 

OK 

We 're getting there

Yeah

Fine

S 'alright

Are we OK Steve

Everything OK

Yeah

Carry on

All right 

Can you keep still Bob 

Uhm 

Have a seat 

Uhm  so then how did uhm  your  work in dance come to  include disabled people 

Uhm  that came about by the  uh the circumstances of of  finding myself working as an artist in the Mike Heafy Centre 

Uhm  while I was there  as a pai 

Sorry can I stop

Shall we

Sorry we have to stop

This is making too much of a racket 

Tell him we are waiting for the order 

Interviews with Adam take two   

Well we 're heading to 

how d' you get into working with disabled people 

Speak up 

Uhm  so how did you get involved in working with disabled dancers 

That came about uh through my work as a painter as an artist

I was working  in that role at the Mike Heafy Centre 

and while I was there  I was introduced to Celeste  uhm who is on the board of Aspire  which is the organisation that set up and ran and runs  uh  the uh the Mike Heafy Centre 

Uhm  Celeste  as well as being on the board  uh uhm uh was a dancer with London Contemporary

I 'll stop you there

We don't need all this

I 'll stop I 'll stop you there OK

So uhm  so what from from the point of view of  an artist 's  s choreography  then the next step was working  with dancers  and and a mixture of able-bodied and disabled dancers

How did that come about

I mean what what is artistically your interest there

Yeah



Yeah 

I think when you 're when you 're working  when I work with dancers  my interest  whoever they whoever the dancers are is  not just about the shapes that they make  uh and the way that they move but the way that they relate to each other 

Uhm  finding myself  in the the Mike Heafy Centre where there were  able-bodied people working alongside disabled people  uhm  I  became increasingly excited about the possibilities of working  with dance  uh in that setting  simply because  a lot of what I saw happening there  didn't seem to really  uhm  engage  both sets of people to a maximum of their physical and their creative abilities

There i there i there was lots of activity that goes on there and some very wonderful things that happen there 

Much of that activity though goes on within the framework of competitive sport 

And  I felt that through dance we could we could  uhm  take the work that was being done there  another step further  uhm  involving people in a in a in a in a much fuller way 

What sort of dance training did you have 

Uhm my initial  interest in movement grew  a long time ago out out of athletics and sports 

Then I became interested in something called Tai Chi  which is a a Chinese movement form  uhm  which involves a lot of relaxation and a lot of attention to  to  can do a huge edit here a lot of attention uh to both detailed and careful movement 

Uhm  I also studied some Japanese movement forms

And then  over a number of years uhm  my interest became increasingly  uh focused towards dance

And I went and studied dance at the Middlesex Polytechnic  for three years and did a joint degree there in dance and visual art 

Uhm 

All right 

So what 's uhm  what kind of what kind of uh aspects of the dancing that you did there do you think has been helpful in in working the way you 're doing now 

Uhm  certainly the the the the work that uhm we did  uhm in areas of release and contact improvi improvisation

That was uh with teachers like Judy Sharp Clare Hayes 

Uhm  developing b both those areas of work were w I think were vital in  developing what I what I usually refer to as a movement language  developing the skills of a dancer to  such an extent that that they can relate to other dancers no matter what  level  the other person is is uhm  no matter what level of skill that other dancer has 

Uhm it 's a very  it 's a dan both dance forms are very much involved in  creating a dialogue between people  uhm and they 're not so concerned with  the  solely with the excellence of a dancer to be seen  up on a stage 

It 's a much more uhm  engaging interaction in which both dancers ' creativity is called upon 

Uhm alongside that work  uhm I I did more formal dance training  uhm which uhm particularly with uhm Leslie Maine Humphrey technique which again has an emphasis on the use of the whole of the body and the use of breath 

And all these elements uhm  I 've f found have  uhm been very useful in the work that I 'm now doing  uhm  which involves disabled people 

So do you think that this work with disabled people uhm is is is th therapeutic work

I mean it sounds like there 's uh technical  things like release work and it sounds like some kind of therapy that you 're doing

Yeah 

Uhm  I think the answer to that is no

it 's not therapy uhm  and I 'm certainly I 'm not trained as a  as a therapist

I 'm trained as a dancer and a creative artist 

Uhm I think a lot of the way that that the arts and dance are progressing is  uhm  is towards an awareness that  part of art and dance  a central part of art and dance is to do with the  recovery of the whole person  uhm to do with making people whole  that that 's the role of art and dance 

And uhm  I think f what 's been happening for for a quite a period of time is that therapy  has been  uhm put on one side dance on another

and people now do things like art therapy and dance therapy  uh which is great

It 's very good work but I think  that art and dance actually include  the idea of therapy within them 

When you say recovering the whole person it suggests that there is something lost

I mean you know is there something incomplete

I mean  uh what 's w what 's what 's incomplete  

Yeah



Why is that necessary

Right

I 'll answer that  in a in a slightly longer and roundabout way

Seventeen years ago I met  for a day uhm  a young man called uh Nat David Schwartz

This was in America 

He was the first person in a wheelchair that I 'd ever met  uh

And he had cerebral palsy 

And I spent a day with him 

And  he  was unable to talk was un ab a ble unable to feed himself 

He communicated by looking  by signalling with his eyes 

I spent a day with him and that day has stayed with me for seventeen years and it and it left a very large question mark  as to  why that should be and how I could be with him in a better way 

The the day left a very strong impression  on me 

Uhm 

It 's now come full circle seventeen years later  and I 'm working  with  a group of disabled and able-bodied people 

It 's a forum where  we and they  all of us can get together 

That one day seventeen years ago was  a one-off event 

It was the first time I 'd met anyone in a wheelchair and it was the first time I 'd spent any time  with a person in a wheelchair

The opportunities didn't seem to be part of the way I was  brought up and educated 

I think  coming back to your question  what makes us whole in that group is the opportunity to be with each other  uh and to work together and to  experiment to try things out to get things wrong together  simply to be together 

Uhm  that really was the answer that  to the question that meeting that David seventeen years ago  uh  had set 

There wasn't really any answer o other than  I should be with these people more often 

Uhm and  I think that 's the only  that 's the crucial thing about the group 

The nature of the work that we do is no different  from  any other creative arts group 

The way we work the way we experiment the way we design choreography  uh  all those things  I think are similar  to other dance groups 

Uhm so if the group isn't uhm primarily concerned with therapy will it perform 

Yes yes

We 're  uhm 

Since you filmed since you did the filming of of the class and the activity that we was going on in the class  we have been working  since that time to develop pieces to perform 

And the first performance will be uhm  in about a month 's time 

So we 're we 're we 're heading that way now 

And uhm  how how do you

I mean how many people are coming to the classes 

The group has has  stabilised at about ten people 

Uhm  so that 's that 's the kind of  our number at the moment

We work with with about with about with ten

And are they all going to perform 

Uhm  a couple of people can't make the performances but the majority of them yes 

And there 's a very wide range of disability

Uhm  does that is that difficult

I mean does that present problems performing

Uhm  absolutely  absolutely uh

But that 's our our bread and butter really

I mean in terms of the way we work we 're constantly confronted with  new challenges because people 

We can never make assumptions

Just because one person comes up with an idea a movement idea  and we like it  the likelihood is that  the seven other people in that piece  can't do it the same way

So we constantly are dealing with  finding ways of  maintaining our connection maintaining the uhm  integrity of a dance piece  with people of of  hugely different abilities physical abilities 

 So it was OK in fact 

And it went all right

so I 've decided that uhm I 'm as far as that bit of the paper goes  I 'm just going to modify a little bit the bit that goes on about element theory  rather than not element theory sorry feature geometry rather than develop it there 

Because me and John said

well he said they they they could definitely handle it  but it because they 'd get round it by underspecifying this that and the other and having tricks as to where the underspecified bits got put in 

but there 's so many different forms of it that they 'd easily manage it 

So basically I mean I said to him  well the rea I want to keep element th uh feature geometry in  I said because not  because  you know I 'm pandering to people who support it

I mean I actually think element theory handles it better

and I think when you look at Bruce Hayes 's analysis  which John didn't take very seriously

Mhm

uhm

What his what does he

What Bruce Hayes was saying

Well I mean he he is a bit weird to have a to combine  particl par particle  theory with a you know feature theory

I mean he 's a bit odd

Uhm 

But uh 

What was I saying

God I 've lost my thread 

I wanted

About you wanted to keep the fea uh feature geometry stuff

Oh yeah

And I said well you know I mean a lot of people wouldn't be necessarily be interested in uh  element theory but if they if they thought that it c it could be handled in feature geometry  then they would probably read the element bit as well and they might ultimately become interested in it 

uhm

And he said oh yes I agree with you

I mean I think that 's fine but you either have to develop it quite a lot or take it out

So what I 'm going to do is say classical feature theory handles it 

But of course you see I mean if you say classical feature theory handles it then of course then you 're back to all the old problems because I mean actually that 's bad for th that in 

Well it 's bad for feature geometry

Feature geometry ultimately can't handle it  because I mean obviously feature geometry took over from all that anyway 

But this I mean they they can they can do

It 's just uh it 's just it 's so convoluted and  all the rest of it that it can't possibly be right

And then he worried me about what about about next week

Yeah

Uhm

Uhm

Don't let him worry you

No no no no

In not in a bad way really

Just you know be careful what you say which is fair I mean you know fair comment 

And then I rai I rushed over to the library to get a couple of the  uhm books that Robins had recommended  uh to just have a look at just so that 

Because I mean I 'm going to say what I 've said before basically

but I 'm not 

Are you going to go to all uhm the day on of the phonology lectures

I think I ought to do that

Yes

I think you had

Yeah

I mean I don't know how much I 'll take in

I think I 'll go to most of them 

But I won't go to all of pragmatics the day before

I 'd go to the Robins one because I mean that like kicks it off

Do you think so

Yes

I would 

Yes

I would because to me  it seems

I mean I 'd go to that and I 'd go to the Palmer one if I was you

I know they 're early  but the thing is they 're like sort of quite  they 're almost like the introductory lectures so I think they 're quite important for scene-setting

Yes

They 'll  pick the thread up won't they

Yeah

Yeah

Uhm  that one actually worries me a little bit

I suppose so

Are you going to go to that 

Which

The first two

Palmer and Firth

Yes

Oh definitely

I don't know what else I 'll go to though 

No 

Because the thing is I 'm going to be absolutely knackered

Yeah

You are

Yeah 

uhm

By the time and by the time it gets to my paper I mean I shall fall asleep

I don't know how I 'll cope with anybody else 's

Yeah

I know

Yeah

Do you want to go and see the film that evening or  just have the 

No

I think uh

We could have dinner that evening or something or just collapse

I think we should I think we should have a

Well I mean don't f

Kaye doesn't even finish till late but I don't think I 'll still be in the  land of the living when Kaye 's stopped talking to be honest with you 

Oh yes

That 's true

No

No

Uhm

I mean I 'll see s let 's see how we go because we got we there 's about three talks after me  I think isn't there or more

There 's tea and one or two other things

Yeah

But we can't walk out because it 's after yours there 's another one

Someone else

Yeah

Then tea which we could clear off at

Uhm

But uhm

I 'll be completely uh

I mean I 'm going to go to Kaye 's to see w if he 's got anything new to say  after thirty-five years of the Turkish data   

But uh there 's a there 's a relevance theory workshop the following week since Sperber is over  which I shall go to  anyway

Uhm

I don't think I 'll join you 

I might go

When when exactly is it on

It 's the twenty-seventh

I think two o'clock in the afternoon  I think

Just that just that 

Yeah

Yes

It 's just a question and answer session

And I just really want to go

I you know I want to s hear it from from his point of view as well

I might pop along then

Yeah

Uhm 

I don't know

it depends whether my brain 's got back engaged by then

Oh

It 'll be six days so 

I 've got to see John  on the Wednesday

and remember

he 's going to start setting me deadlines

Oh

Don't let him upset you before the talk 

He 's away all next week

He doesn't think he 'll even be at the talk

Oh right 

Oh right

Oh well

So 

I just met Xepe and Marcella and had a large ice cream

Oh Xepe turned up did he

He 's in most days 

What they 're doing is they 're working on the  Pascal thing which they 'll have to  uhm do at Cambridge because  from Agnieszka 's point of view it was so difficult despite the fact that she 's  really good

Oh

So she 's advised them to to get a good grounding before they go

I don't know that she 's advised them but she 's put it in their minds that it 's going to be really tough

So who 's who 's they

Xepe and Andrew

And they basically getting this under their belt before they go

I think that 's very sensible

So do I

Yes

Uhm they didn't give themselves a break though after the deadline

They went straight into it the next day 

Well but they 'll they 'll probably you know they 'll probably hit a point where

Actually it 's not necessarily such a bad thing because the chances are that if they leave it they 'll never do it

Well it was totally different

Yeah

I 'm very surprised at their commitment and pleased

I mean it 's nice

uhm 

It 's very sensible actually

Yeah

Cos I was just thinking about Pete at Edinburgh the A I thing 

I mean one of the problems there was he was spending most of the day just trying to catch up  because he said that the A I thing that he went on to was gea was supposedly geared towards people  who didn't have a computer background

And it wasn't

And it wasn't at all

No way

No

And every single person without a computer background failed

Failed 

Uhm

And I mean that 's ridiculous

And th and I mean if you have a course like that then you 've got to start looking at your course 

You 've got to you 've got to  uh do something about that because that 's you that isn't P

I mean Pete was Pete was clever

Well I

Yeah

Well I think the thing is that with computers

and I feel this from a from a a layperson 's point of view 

a person who specialises in computers one way or another or even just uses one every day  more than I do I mean you know 

I don't do anything with it really

I just sort of word process really 

But someone who 's who 's computing  they forget  how  difficult it is for you to understand anything

And you know if you don't know the sin sin simple command how to get out of something  you 're sunk

But I mean to do a course in it I mean I

uhm

uhm

I think

Yeah

But I mean it 's it yeah it 's even at a higher level than that though because I mean Pete could do basic things on a computer but it wasn't enough 

And he was very intelligent and it still wasn't enough

So I think it 's probably as well that they 've gone straight into it because I think if they 'd had a break  they would never have got back into it

uhm

uhm

uhm

Philip 's not actually doing that course you know

I thought he was here

What 's he doing

He 's doing computer science course 

Ah 

M S C

Well that 'll still be fairly tough

He went for a job yesterday as an uhm London Tourist Board information giver

I thought he 'd got a job with someone

Well he had but he 's he keeps going

Super high-flying

Well he told me it 's this super high-flying uhm uh updating computer software stuff

I 'm sure it 's the old job he used to have cleaning them  

But it went off OK last night then did it

Did you have a good turnout

It was really pleasant

Yeah

We had a very good turnout

Uh we charged a quid in the end

Oh you did

Because we otherwise we would 've been overdrawn and then I would 've been out of pocket

Oh well

Right

Well right that 's fair enough then

Well the thing was that the whole point was that we were going to have strawberries and cream

I mean it 'd been left to me to organise it

so I said right does everyone fancy strawberries and cream

Well I think it 's a good idea

It 's a summer theme

Yeah 

Yeah

And uh Xepe and Sandra were  yeah  Xepe and Sandra were going to go and get it

Bob was going to go and get the Pimms 

And I was  just going to be telling people what to do which was fine 

And then what does Philip do

He he arrives in the morning with six bag nine even baguettes  uh a whole brie two lots of pat&eacute; and  a tub of marge

Pre-Wimbledon

So you didn't get the strawberries and all the rest of it or you did

Well uhm he 'd already given Xepe to the money to get the strawbs and Pimms

So I I said  get it anyway

and Philip agreed 

So of c I knew we 'd be out of pocket over it but I was blowed if we were going to have just that 

And it went down really well

Uhm

Philip has no right not to agree

D' you have anything left 

No

Well yeah

I 've got a lemon at home 

And we 'd you know we put cucumber and lemon and orange in the Pimms

Uhm

Lots of people turned up

It was really good

I had letters from people who didn't who couldn't  uhm Neil and Dick 

Oh

Neil didn't go

No

Uh apparently he had a lecture

I don't know whether he was giving it or or taking it

Oh

He 'd be giving it  I would imagine

Or whatever

Yeah 

Uhm  and then we just went to the bar

How long did you do English for

Uh I did it for about half a term 

When

In s second

Yeah

But you weren't doing you weren't you weren't really doing English though were you really

You were doing 

In the second year

I was

I was doing a unit

Officially I was doing a unit of English

Of what

English

Uh d' you mean of what kind of English

Yes

What do they call it

Uh  I can't remember uhm

Something terribly arty no doubt

Uh  I can't remember

We had a lecture by that guy Rene Weis over there

He 's uhm  he was a really nice guy

Lovely 

In the common room that 's a lovely place to have it

Mm 

What 's actually going to be happening on uhm  Sunday

What are we going to do

Is is the idea that we just go for a walk around Richmond Park

Well Xepe seems to love this idea of having a picnic but I 'm not too sure about this

Not if you 've had lunch

Because I 'll have eaten anyway

Well I mean part part of the reason I am eating will be so that I we don't have to have a picnic

Yeah

Why

Because you hate getting anything like that prepared 

One 

I haven't got anything like that anyway

And Xepe 's going on about ooh I could cook an omelette or something

What in the middle of Richmond Park

No no no

I mean previously cook an omelette

Oh I see

It 's just this

If we have a picnic for a start it 's going to cost us cash  which I haven't got and secondly  uh it is going to uh  to mean Xepe 's going to bring along some 

Yeah

Mm

No

Me neither

Plus it might rain or something  and we might not want to do it

Yeah

So I 'd rather eat beforehand just to avoid uh  any problems there

Yeah

Yeah

Wise move

And then we 'll probably get a vid out or something

Oh that 'll be really good

Like Oak

Like 

Have you seen The Silence Of The Lambs 

Yes

It 's only just come out in the cinema

There seems to be this this misunderstanding with people that things that come out on video

No

No no

No no

I understood that it 's not out on video

No

I just wondered if you 'd seen it

Yes

I have

And you oh you were the one who

I was the one who 's seen it

Oh Marcella has as well

She thinks it 's brilliant quite frightening

Really quite groovy

So you can't not only can you not get that out on video   but you can't go and see it at the cinema either  because I 've seen it

So we 're going to have

Because you 've seen it

I 'm sorry

Well we 're going to have a we 're going to have endless discussions over what kind of film to get out aren't we

Can you set it up on your  uhm uhm sort of stereo thingummybob that you

So you 're stuck with it aren't you

Well it 's all set up anyway

The only thing is if uh  arty

Because it 's going to be an arty film almost certainly because you like arty films  and Xepe likes arty films

And you see Xepe doesn't like drossy rubbish like Back To The Future 

He he got really pissed off when we were watching Back To The Future Two

He sort of sat in the corner

He di he di he didn't give it a chance though

I mean he didn't even think about it so

No no no no no

Not necessarily

Not necessarily

Yeah

No no

Well

Yeah

No

It 's not the kind of stuff I find

I mean I don't mind sillyish American films if they 're goodish sillyish Americanish films

Well I  most of them thought Back To The Future Two was utterly brilliant

I did certainly

Oh but it was just so predictable

Have you seen it

I 've seen o one of a bit of one of them

But I 

And you condemn the series having seen a bit of one of them

No no that that no no that that bit where he goes shooting off in the car up the road and they he has to catch on to that electric bit and then that that flash of lightning comes and it knocks the thing down and it 's will will that mad professor get the thing back up in time to

Yes 

Yes

Yes

Have you seen the whole film though

Well he has this stupid girl he falls in love with doesn't he or something

No

No it 's his Mum and she falls in love with him

Oh 

It 's all very well done

Oh

And the second one is excellent

It 's very very very similar

No

But when he 's back in normal time with his parents there 's this girl who ogles round

Oh she 's called Jennifer

Yes

Is that her

Mm

Mm

He falls in love with his Mum back in time

It 's his Mum falls in love with him

Oh

But he knows it 's his Mum

Oh he knows it 's his Mum yes

But she obviously hasn't the faintest idea

Ah

Oh

No

Because the reason

But wouldn't she remember him

I mean wouldn't she have a grown up son and think god he 's exactly like the bloke I fell in love with

No no

She hadn't had him at that point

No

I know

But when she has had him

I mean she fell in love with him the fifteen-year-old him back in time

Yes

Yes

Yes

Don't you think that when she sees him as her son she 'll recognise won't she sort of recognise him as the same person 

I mean you have to completely suspend belief

Who knows

Who knows

Oh you do

Oh absolutely

You have to susp completely suspend everything in fact

Oh

Yeah

I 'm I 'm not saying it 's a it 's a completely intricate part

Can we

You 've seen you 've seen Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles haven't you

I have

Yes 

We can get that out if you want

But I d I don't think

I don't think Xepe would

I wouldn't mind seeing that

No

Well it 's not that wonderful a film really 

let 's be honest

I 'm sure we 'll find something

No

Xepe would like Doon but I think we had this or Dune

We had a big chat about this before didn't we

Mm

Why do you want that

Well I don't know

I just think he 'd like it

Because it 's David Lynch he thinks it 's going to be really arty

I don't know

I don't

Is it David Lynch

Dune is

Yeah

Is it

Ah

But it 's completely un-David Lynch really

Oh

After all his weirdo crap

Yeah 

I don't know

So 

You see Xepe 's going to be reluctant to see anything that he hasn't heard of

And and he hasn't heard of much either so uh  

I expect there 's just as much going on in Galicia

There 's not much you can do about it

Oh we 'll find something

I mean a quid

Doesn't matter if it 's really crap 

Haven't wasted much cash

No

That 's true

We could come round with a bottle of something and I could bring the odd bottle of cider

We could do that but then I can't actually take you back to the station 

Uhm oh that 's true

Or coke coke will do 

Yes

I could probably manage to take you back to the station on some coke

Yeah

On coke

Yes

Anyway if it 's really bad weather we 'll just  you know stay in 

Or watch two videos

Absolutely

Stay in and watch two videos

Yeah

That 's all you 've got to do

I 've got nothing

I 'd quite like to go to Richmond Park because I was reading about it in this novel

I isn't it where all the the the last century upper middle classes used to drive around on Sundays in their their uhm what are they called uhm 

What are the names of those horse-drawn carriages

Uhm 

Did they

I don't know

Uh hansoms and chaises and things

Yeah

Hansom cabs

Yeah

I mean uh hansom cabs were like taxis actually

But the the posh ones 

So that would be

Didn't there used to be deer in Richmond Park

Yeah

There still are

Are there

Oh what sort of park is it 

It 's quite a huge one

She says trying to sound really interesting for this tape

It 's just a big park

Yeah

It 's a huge great expanse of green you know 

It 's very it 's very big

I mean it 's not like a

I mean is there much is there much on it

Is it just green like just like a park

I se

Well it 's very hilly

I mean lots of lots of little woods and stuff

Ah

Ah

And there 's a what 's there 's a little bit in it  which is called something that I can't think of at the moment

Some kind of pond or something 

Yes

There 's a 

It 's a garden a botanical garden type thing  and I can't remember what it 's called

Ah

I bet it 's busy on Sundays 

Probably is

Ah well

It 's pretty hard to park there anyway

No

But there there there there 's lots of deers and lots of rabbits

It 's not deers

It 's deer

Deer

There are lots of deer and lots of rabbits

I do apologise for that

I 'm sorry

Can we can we scrap that 



Edit that one out 

You won't you probably won't see them though

They tend to keep themselves to themselves and well away from the roads

I had to  I had to correct this American outside the National Gallery yesterday because I was waiting for someone and uhm  he

Who shall remain nameless

 And he started talking to me and said uh said he 'd been to Edinburgh and I had to tell him that it was that it was Edinburgh

Had he

Oh dear

And he 'd been there

And he 'd been there

Mm

He was standing outside in front of the National Gallery going isn't it beautiful we just don't have anything like this in America 

That was a bit sad

What a shame

And then uh 

Because you haven't got a history mate you should 've said to him

Yeah

I should 've 

Moosh



Mm

So

Yes

Anyway that is what Richmond Park is like

Oh good

And it 's not that far away

But I 'll have to drive

How far

About three miles probably

Oh

It 's not out then

Oh

If it 's a really nice day we could walk

or is it just too far to walk

Yeah

No

You have to walk through the middle of Kingston as well

When 's your Mum coming back

Uh  Friday I think

Uh hu 

Friday very early morning

My Dad was trying to convince me to to meet her uhm

No thanks very much

Be leaving about half five or something I think

Uhm lovely idea

But think I 'll stay in bed



I think she should wait at the airport

I mean instead of getting people up so early she could stick around and have breakfast for an hour or two

Oh

That 'd be great

Yeah

Father doesn't mind

She 'd be terribly offended if we didn't come and pick her up

Well I think it 's a bit unreasonable

If it 's something like half past five in the morning when you could easily sit down and have you know

By the time the luggage has come through and planes are delayed anyway you might as just might just as well say well come and meet us at eight or something and make it a bit decent for everyone

Well I don't want to go anyway

Don't you think 

Mm

So  I don't really want to go anyway so  I don't see it makes a difference  really

I 'll leave those wallflowers in as w to the last moment

What

So all the flowers have died on them

Well these other ones are not coming along very well so

The ones on the right hand side you can just cut the tops off and leave them

They 'll come up next year then

I 'm peeved about that giving her that window

I was a fool

I was wasn't growing seeds then of course

What window

Piece of glass

Her next door when she was down or something 

A glazed uhm sash window

I could 've used it to bring these blasted seeds on 

Could 've cleared that square yard on down that right-hand border in the sun put the seed boxes on the ground and the uh window glass over it 

No

You can't blame her for that really can you

If you gave it to her Dad

No

Well these damn plants have shot up in price so much over the last year or two

Yes

Those few begonias were a pound

Yes

Absolute daylight robbery really aren't they 

It is the only way to grow them yourself really

I mean and plant them out 

What you want 's a little greenhouse really  don't you

No that that 's frame a little cold frame

No

I don't think so

What

Not in his shed even

No no

I brought that from Bow because I got it from the place next door when they threw all their window frames out

Oh 

I got two

But I I can't I think I left the other one up at Bow

Didn't want it

What 's happened to the door we had out there

Can't you  saw the lower bit off and use that

Still out there

No

It 's all frosted glass

It 's almost opaque

Oh

Oh

Almost opaque 

Well can't you buy a piece of glass somewhere

D' you know how much glass is now

It 's not very much

It 's expensive

It 's not because they bought a piece to go in their window

Yes because because I broke that window

I think it cost them three quid or something

No 

Cost a lot more now

It was something like one pound eighty 

No

Glass is very expensive

I 'll tell you

And that was fancy glass

I tell you what I could look out for and that 's a picture frame  because that 's got glass in it hasn't it

Wouldn't be very large but it 'd be big enough to go over a box of seeds

Or a clip frame

those are quite cheap

Well I I I want something bigger than one box of seeds

No

That damn thing would 've done ideally well it annoys me to see it there sitting smugly growing her seeds

Well does she use it

Well she 's using it

Well you can't blame her lovey

You gave it to her 

That just sh shows you the policy of keeping things 

Meany



Well I mean

Well at the time you weren't growing seeds so you didn't want it

I mean you can hardly ask for it back

I mean that 's not on is it

I had it in that garage for nearly thirty years

Did you really

An awfully long time anyway

Haven't you got any more glass out there at all

Well I don't think so

Only small pieces

But that 's convenient

I mean just lift it up  water them down again just like that

Ooh I could kick myself

Well you can't ask for it back dear

Don't you dare

No

But if he pegs out and she moves I 'll have it back

Oh mm

I expect she had any amount of glass panes down the bottom there

Windows

and Lord knows what she 's just broken up 

She got rid of a lot of glass

Yes

Yes

But that 's convenient because it 's edged with wood isn't it

Exactly

Well don't uh glower at me

I didn't give it to her

Good job I didn't isn't it

otherwise I wouldn't be  

Why don't you uhm replace one of the back doors here and use the pane from that

Well if I ever have to replace a  back door I shall do so

Well they 're rotten now Dad so one day you 'll have to

Well I 'm just putting that off for as long as possible

They 'll fall out into the garden one day

It 's a hundred and fifty pound job to replace a door

That 's quite cheap I would 've thought

Cor dear oh dear

Well no it 's not cheap

But I mean 

I don't think it 's cheap 

Well I 'll look out for something in the antique market that

What you want y y I 'll tell you

where you 'll find something is a car boot sale something like that

No no no

There used to be places where they sold secondhand building materials and all that sort of thing

Yes

There still are I 'm sure

No

I know where I got that one from

When  w a large house was demolished on Westmoreland Hill

Oh I thought you got it from got it from Bow uhm

Oh yeah I know

Yeah where we found the tiles 

What tiles

Oh I don't don't know tiles but I that 's where I found that

Richard and I

 Richard and I uhm found some ti bits of tiles Victorian tiling

Oh

Oh

You know blu white and blue stuff

Mm

Ugh

It wasn't very exciting

Ugh

I don't want you dribbling on those

Don't think we should 've been up there

Probably not

No 

But I still got I got some even larger ones at Bow but I left those behind in the attic when we sold 

Along with the other things you left there 

Such as what 

Oh I had some large picture frames with ancestors

Precisely

Exactly

Couldn't bring everything

 do we

Thank you very much

You should keep your ancestral paintings

They weren't paintings

They were uh just photographs

Daguerreotypes

There 's no

Just big photographs

I don't want great big life-size photographs of relatives hanging on the wall thank you

Especially not that side of the family 

Any side of the family thank you from that era

They were a large dumpy looking

Because the same era would 've been horse copers on your mother 's side

Yes exactly

Who

I mean your mother there was a large picture of your mother 's mother wasn't there in a sort of wig looking as fierce as anything

What

Uhm

What 's a horse coper

Well a horse breaker

No

I don't know that they all were

I mean that was just an uncle

A sort of 

Glorified gipsy

That was one uncle that uh that was nothing to do

He wasn't a gipsy 

Nonsense

You 're a snob Dad

Yes

You 're such a snob honestly

You 're wearing that battery out

Leave that battery alone 

That looks  if somebody comes down and starts 

What

Swearing and cursing 

Which is the the off switch

It 's all right

I 'll deal with it

Why is it that everybody I interview starts discussing the equipment 

Do they all do that when you interview them

Well I interviewed Andrew on Friday

And uhm  he was fascinated by it because he tol sold them in Boots

Kept wanting to look at the peak flow meter or peak yeah

Oh

What is the time

Can you see over there

I can't see over the flowers

Twenty twenty to one nearly

Twenty five to one

Twenty five to one



Were you going to do something about the dinner then  

Now let 's see

Now today is  ninth ah

As from tomorrow I can get my M O T done 

Think I 'll get that done first of all as number one priority

I think 

Sunday

Come on in there if you want to 

Turn it off

That 's enough isn't it

How much more do you want

No

I need half an hour

Oh for heaven 's sake

Can't keep on gassing on for half an hour

I 've got to go and see to the dinner in a minute 

That 's a bit of a tall order isn't it 

Don't like her at all 

Not that much

Well what 's all this about do not  

Always poking her damn nose in isn't she

I haven't heard that

Many students do not realise they can use the careers information resources of any local university or polytechnic

I 'm sure they 'd be delighted if you came from another university and wanted to use them 

Don't you think that 's so Laura

I 've no idea 

That 's good that is

Simon doesn't pay but Laura the student does

Uhm well it 's not his fault is it if he hasn't uh been sent the forms

I wouldn't pay it either

And yet she has to put on her form you see that he she 's living with him in that address

Doesn't get sent the forms

Why

Because you have to fill in how many members there are in your your uhm  thing

I it 's a question on the form

Yes

Is it

I don't remember that

Well she says she has to anyway because it 's in the form she gets anyway 

Well she probably has to put the number of people occupying the whole property  presumably

Well I don't suppose she knows how many people are living in the whole property

Me

Mhm

Well at least ten or twenty people 

Well that 's a bit of a difference 

Well there are ten flats

I 'd love to see some of the forms they get in

I bet there 's a lo load of old rubbish put on these forms don't you

How on earth do they tuck ten flats into that one semi-detached 

Here

Has Richard filled that form in that he 's got

I don't know 

He 's been sent a tax form so

Has he

Mm



Mm

Oh 

Oh I should have thought he 'd 've had one before now 

Mm

So would I

But there you are

No

First time he 's had one

I 've never had one

Who you

Nor 've I

No you wouldn't Stuart because you don't pay tax 

But of course now they 're going to send everyone one aren't they regardless of whether you  pay tax or not

Uh I don't know

They 've got a tremendous job on if they do

I was going to say

I can't afford to pay it

They sent one to my mother after she died or something

Well  it was sent to her home and then it was sent I mean to her own home uh and she 'd moved from there of course and was in the nursing home and they sent it there

And then they sent it on to Keith

But Keith lost it so we never sent it

Yes I know

You told me at the time 

Did I

I don't remember 

Lost in the post  in the reposting

Nothing 's ever happened about it

No 

I mean they surely they don't keep hold of everybody

I don't believe it do you

They can't uh  keep tracks on everybody

Shouldn't think so 

That 's a shirt isn't it or  supposed to be

Yes

It 'd look nice with a belt or something or wouldn't it

No

I really don't mind

Have you



Have you taken something off or put something on

What about tying that scarf round the middle of it

Or would that look funny

Oh yes

You 've put a skirt a skirt on 

Oh it was only an idea Laura

Oh yes

I couldn't see

I thought it was the same thing that you were wearing before

I had a lovely gold belt once a sort of link belt once

D' you remember

I sold it though

No I don't

No

I was programming in Pascal which really wasn't very exciting I 'm afraid

Oh what d' you mean by programming in Pascal



Well actually Cilla

No uh 

No I was just trying to get  the thing going because we 've got uh 

Well the book 's about two hundred and fifty pages long and we 're not really doing what we should be doing at the moment

Xepe and me have had about ten minutes yeah ten minutes over the last week or something

So we haven't really got very far which is a bit sad

Uhm

But why d' you have to do any before you go on the course

Well because otherwise we 're going to be completely lost

Agnieszka was having so much trouble uh because she only knew  syntax or whatever 

In which case you ought to be doing some phonetics surely

No because I plan to be out of phonetics as quickly as possible  really

Yes

But it might well help if you 've uhm actually done some

Uh no I don't

Well they 're not interested in phonology apparently which just seems very odd

and I don't quite know how how they can how they can get away with with doing any any form of analysis without phonology

but that 's their own problem

Uh no they were they they do basics of phonetics and articulatory phonetics as well

You would 've thought so

 

I don't know

No



Uhm

So that 's

Yeah I I 've done extremely basic acoustics so I 'm quite happy with that really

You didn't did you do that here

Yeah

I did that

That was the horrible nine o'clock one on a Tuesday

Is that the one that Philip 's just done  and Jane

Yeah the one that Philip actually

The one that Philip got very annoyed because I always used to do the experiments twice as quick as as him

Oh so you actually did it this year

So why didn't you do the exam

I only did for the first term

Oh you didn't do it for credit

I did I did the sort of uh acousticky bit of it

As soon as they got on to doing phonetics I left uh partly because it was nine o'clock in the morning and not really a very good time for me or or or my bank balance because it costs me like a a fiver more to come in for nine o'clock than it does if I come in for eleven

So I thought sod it I can't be bothered

Or anyone

Mm Mm

Plus it 's two hour practicals which took 

There were two hour practicals on Wednesdays which took me ten minutes because I wasn't bothered with the accuracy of my  results

The idea was you know we were supposed to do all these graphs and stuff

You saw what happened

I saw what happened

so I plotted a few dots in thought ooh yeah that 's right that 's what it 's supposed to look like

Mm

And uh somebody who who 'll remain nameless I don't know if he 's going to hear this  is going is going to be  sitting there with his little  little bit of paper crossing all the things off exactly and making sure and I you know 

No he 's not going to

so stop worrying

Bye see you Sunday

Yeah

But he 's a perfectionist

I mean there 's a

I 'm not saying you 're not

but I mean uhm plus the

Yeah

Well not when I don't need to be

I just do what I have to do

No

Plus the fact uhm

I mean where he learnt acoustics which was at the Speech Therapy college it 's looking for a different thing  altogether

Yeah

And that I think that is why his attitude was different 

But that was one reason why I never wanted to do that again actually

Yeah I don't know

No but it was very silly the things he used to do

like we were all

You just had to plot the response curves of the tape

And they give us a couple of tapes and say

right plot the response curves

And he would take stupid amounts of measurements which you really didn't need  you know

No

To get an idea

To get an idea

It might have changed by one D B perhaps over seventy seventy whatevers 

So he 'd make all these points and they were all the same

So I just made one there and joined them up and it it 's hardly any difference

You just guessed that it was sort of a gradient that did that

And then you were there

Uhm

Uhm

Yeah

Well I 'm surprised you didn't all make it a group effort and all go and look at all your graphs and in that way save all doing hundreds of points

Well there 's only

Who was doing it

Jane Osborne was doing it uh but she didn't sort of turn up much which was a bit of a shame

She never made it for for nine o'clocks

She 'd uh occasionally walk in about quarter to ten uh

and  she popped in to the odd the odd practical

but she was actually taking it for credit

and it was a whole unit

Uhm

So poor old little Janey

Yeah

We were having a discussion with Bob actually about the uh  yeah the organisation of the course 

And he was

Bob 's in today

Oh

Oh did you go to that meeting

I didn't

But he went

and there 's there 's a bit Dick 's written on the on the the minutes or whatever student action on uh what do the students think of the course in general and the B A and and what could be done to improve it

Uhm uhm

And so Bob drafted this questionnaire and gave it to Dick

And Dick basically said he didn't like it because it was there were questions like were you given enough guidance and were your personal tutors good enough

And these are of course the the sort of questions that Dick doesn't really want answered because if someone says no the guidance wasn't good enough and our personal tutors weren't good enough then Neil 's going to say to Dick

right that 's your job

No

Mm Mm

And Dick 's going to be completely stuffed

Mm

And he 's going to have to go round and  you know hit John Harris and people like that a lot and say

why don't you

Back from Barcelona I think

Is he

Oh Bob was going to try and find him today

Yeah he is

He I think he 's been around

Mm

This is a perfectly good conversation as far as I 'm concerned

I don't know why you 're

No

It 's absolutely fine

You seem to be taking it more more recordedly than me

Oh no

Hello

I don't know whether to check whether it 's working or not

Wouldn't that be a  pretty pretty odd sort of proposition like have a look to see if it 's going round would always be  a good one

Practical

Yes

Yeah

It 's going round

Well it 's going round and the record button 's down

That 's probably

Yeah

That 'll do

What is it

It 's a it 's a it 's a machine

Uh is it a D C Six

I don't know

No

It isn't is it

How would you know what make it was

It 's got a bloody great Sony sticker there

No I mean you know  apart from the fact that it has Sony written on it 

Why have you got lots of experience

What what numbers



Oh this conversation 's getting really bad isn't it

Why can't we just talk about linguisticky things anyway

Yes go on then

three-or-four-words

Are you going to

Oh the linguistics thing

Monday the the computer room is all booked up

Don't worry no no

nothing nothing else to say

I w I can't

No it 's booked up with the word processing thing from half past nine till five

So r it 's a complete waste of time me coming in

Xepe 's coming in anyway because he 's got to do some teaching on Monday

Oh all right

So you 're not coming in right

Well is he still meeting me uhm

I think so

Yeah he said he seemed quite quite happy to meet you

I 'm I 'll attempt not to turn this off

Well I mean it 's no problem because if he doesn't turn up if he doesn't turn up I 'll just uhm  you know go and get some sandwiches or something

Mm

Are you going to be in on Tuesday then or just leave it till Wednesday

Uh  I might come in on Tuesday depending if I 've got anything to do

It is a D s it is a D six

I thought it would be

There you are

D' you know how much these cost

Yes

I do

You do



Round about two hundred and fifty

They 're not too bad

That 's why I 'm worried

I 'm taking it out on the street

And I 'm a bit worried about it

Well not the street but



No they were they were given a fairly good write-up

Are you recording

Ah yeah you you 're recording in C then

D' you normally record in C

I 've no idea

It 's the first time I 've done it 

No

It 's just if you 're doing phonetics analysis you know you should never record in Dolby 

No I know

but if you 're doing

I know

I know

But if you 're doing phonetics analysis you should never record in C so I 've been told

No it 's not phonetics analysis though

Right I shall bear that in mind for future reference when I 'm recording for phonetic reasons 

Yes

Yes

Hello

I 'm just wondering if this is actually picking anything up

Mum said she thought you she saw you earlier 

Did she

Where did she see me

Uhm I don't

I think through the cloisters or something

Right 

And Xepe met my parents today

Uh

And what what did he did he charm them

Uhm 

Mum said ah yes the one who doesn't sound as if he isn't English

Sorry

Run that past me again

the one

Uhm Mum said oh yes the one that

Yeah right OK

The one that doesn't sound as if he 's

Yes I 've got it right

OK

Uhm

So why isn't this giving a peak level reading

You don't know that either do you

I don't know that either

I wish you 'd stop looking at it and  leave it alone

Why

Well nothing 's going to happen to it really

It 's only two hundred and fifty sods

I mean who cares

Three hundred and fifty

No it 's not

Two fifty

I think somebody 's been leading you up the garden path

Well they were certainly they were certainly two fifty 

when did I buy my camera about two years ago

They 'd just released the six then

There 's the top of the range 

Very nice certainly 

Oops

Yeah so

Prod prod

We 're recording 

It 's very exciting as well

I can tell you

Yeah

Yeah

So I won't be in on Monday but he will

Bye bye 

Uh  I still don't know about this this rather dodgy idea of sticking my car in but

Oh I

Yes that reminds me

Oh yes

I 've forgotten to tell you all this

Uhm Matt Street phoned while I was out

He 's the guy who is supposed to have left

And he had my papers and so that was the problem over the party

Uhm he phoned

Anyway he phoned back

and he said

look I 've got nothing to do

I thought well no it 's not surprising really considering you 've given up your exams

Uhm and he said can I pop over

So I said yes here

So he came over here and he got the cheque off me

He said it 's fine

He got a cheque off me for twenty-four pounds ten which is for the beadle 's taxi home the beadle 's overtime and the bar  and a deposit of ten quid which is in case the bar doesn't take more than fifty pounds

Who

Oh the one who 's left and 

Yeah



What here

Yeah

And the bar for a start

Right

Which is unlikely let 's face it

So I said so I said to him

well look the thing is that it 's I can tell you now it 's highly unlikely to take more than fifty pounds

We 're having a few bottles but that 's all

But they 're not an alcoholic lot so you know

More than fifty quid yeah

And there aren't that many of them and everybody everybody 's got to buy two drinks really for us to to get fifty quid

Yeah

Yeah

So he said well look if I might be really generous and waive it

Oh you know when you were in France did you uh take any good photographs 

I took lots of photographs

I don't know if they 're any good though

But we shall see

Oh  I 'm sure they will be



uhm mainly chateaux and places like that

And even interiors you know

Uh do you remember the ones you took of Napoleon 's bedroom

Mm 

I took one or two uhm 

Some places are a bit funny on 

Well they don't like you taking interior shots   but uh  I have got a few

Mm

No

If you took the 

the Balda 

did you need flash 

No I load up with fast film

Mm 

Oh

No I don't like using flash because it  causes unnatural lighting  plus it also means that the the correct brightness is focused 

So for instance you 're taking a  ph photograph of a line of people with a flash gun right  going away from you 

What you 'll find is that people who are nearer the camera will be bleached out  people midway if that 's how it 's all been set up will be correctly exposed  and people falling back will be dark  uhm

So I prefer to use uh  natural lighting

But that has its uh  problems as well  uh with regard to slow shutter speeds and and movement of  people and camera 

But most of my my internal shots are usually static

and people out of the way

so it 's  it 's most successful on that

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah

Mm

Yes

Mm

Yes

Yeah

Yeah 

Any decent wines 



I had quite a bit

Uhm I can't remember any specific names but  they 're usually very good in France

Mm

Mm

Mm

Well yeah yes 

You can say that again and again and again

Picked up lots of uh Badoit 

Did you mm

It 's only about thirty two pence a bottle out there for a litre

Mm that 's worth saving

Do you drink quite a lot of it 

Use it as a mixer for my uhm  lemonade  and lime lemon lime and

Someone introduced it to me the other day

Mhm

It 's uh this pink grapefruit thing at Sainsbury 's

Yes that 's nice

Just find it a bit just find it a bit just find it a bit sharp uh taste

Yes that 's all right 

Well I quite like that sort of quininey taste that grapefruit has

Slightly bitter taste you know

I find it more refreshing than those sweety things

That 's good but

Yeah

I also ticked up picked up some tins of uh cassoulet  and  choucroute royale 

That 's a cabbage thing

Oh yes  mm with frankfurters and sausages and things

Mm that 's right

Yeah I 've still got those things which Shar brought back  in in the summer

I must  eat them

Yes

You ought to use them

They 've got sell-by dates uh use-by dates on them

Yes

Well that 's all about three years in advance

I don't know why but uh it 's sitting there

I was sort of saving it for a rainy day and the rainy

Well touch wood

the rainy day 's never come 

Yeah

You were staying at this sort of

Was it a converted farm house or a a farm house which was still being used 

It 's been converted just to ordinary  domestic living accommodation 

It 's about  fifteenth or sixteenth century 

They had a  photograph album showing all the stages having uh of it being  renovated 

A very very major job  uh relaying floors redoing all the beams uhm 

Took them uh I think some some something like ten to fifteen years to complete it

Mhm

Mm

Yeah

Mm

Yeah

Well yes 

Because they were doing it on their own you see

Mm

Could they get the right sort of materials  you know to make it tone in

Yeah I think they got  stonemasons to do their bit

They had a very

They had a lovely large fire  which opens out into the living room kitchen which is all sort of open-plan  uh very large similar to the one in Norfolk 

Mm

Mm

Yes

Mm

What Cath 's and John 's

That 's right

Yes

Yes well that 's fifteenth century isn't it 

I think so

They 've got a salt box haven't they over the near the fire you know sort of hollow beam where you keep the salt or used to keep the salt dry

Yes

Oh Cath was in this afternoon

she was showing me some photographs of uh  herself and John in the Lake District and uh oh various ones of Chris and Zo&eumlaut; and uhm also some  of the cottage

They 've had somebody in to sort of strip back the uh  plaster to the beams inside as s 

Yeah yes

One side

Yes that 's right

Downstairs

Right

And uh  sh she showed me some

Oh quite nice that 

Good mm

What was the grub like 

In France I mean

Well we had uhm 

The people we were staying with they  uh cooked us a traditional Normandy dinner 

Very very free range chicken 

Tasted quite dark 

Cooked with apple and uh potatoes

And a very nice sauce to go with it

Mm

Mhm

Mhm

Oh yes

Very Normandy yes

Very good mm

What was interesting was the uh breakfast  petit d&eacute;jeuner uhm

They made their own jams typically r runny like French jams 

Uh one was black curr red currant 

One was pears

That was an interesting one the pears one

Yes

Yes



Not tasteless

No it was nice

And quince

Mm you like quince

Mm

Mm

Doug makes quince jelly sometimes doesn't he

That 's right

Yes

And crabapple jelly I remember

Yes yes yes right

Yes

Yeah

It was nice 

Pear sounds as though it might be more flat you know tasteless as though it might need something to spike it sort of

Lemon or something added to it you know 

Maybe she did do something to it

It certainly tasted strong enough

Yeah

Oh well yes yes

Had this slightly uh well granular texture 

Well wouldn't it be a granular texture because pears are granular aren't they syllables-or-words

They 're not smooth like an apple 's flesh

Mm yes yes mm

Yes yeah

What did you have it on

Brioche croissant

Yes I know

Mm that 's right yes

Right

No their homemade brown bread

Ah le pain complet oh the complete wholemeal yes

Complete

Yeah

Very nice 

Heavy 

It was good

Mm  mm sounds delicious

They had a tendency to cook their coffee in saucepans 

Make their coffee I should say in saucepans

Well they bring it to the boil and whip it off the stove

Mm something like that

Yeah

That 's the old soldier 's way isn't it 

They 've got a thing which is the equivalent to our Aga 

Yeah

And they have a conventional cooker as well which they were using 

Mm mm

Mm

Sounds lovely

Very nicely done

The actual uh kitchen units floor ones were all stone with doors put into them

Mm 

What the units were stone 



Well I think what they did is that uh with the spare masonry they uh  just built built it up with uh a apertures for  the doors  and made their doors and put them in

Yes

The actual work surface was a a very thick piece of wood  dumped on top  all held in place by 

Oh I see

Yeah oh I see

But the wall will stand will it

Mm yes

Yes mm

That 's quite original

The wall was about 

Huge gap of about probably about one and a half feet deep 

Very thick

Yeah

Mm last several lives one-or-two-word

Should do

it 's been around long enough

Mm

Yes yes yes 

And you uh  uhm drove out from there every day did you

Which car did you take 

Volvo

Yes

Who did most of the driving 

Not I

No

Doug

Yes mm 

I I 'm only covered to drive it in emergencies out there

Yes

If his hip gives way

Well yes mm

Yes he yes he does need somebody with him to cover to drive you know

In England

In England it doesn't matter because  he can get help as he 's uh the only one allowed to drive that car 

But when it 's used abroad I go with him

He pays an extra fiver on the insurance and it covers me for that period

Yes



Mm mm 

That is a nice car 

And uh  you went all around

I mean the card you sent

it was from the uhm  marches of Brit well Brittany wasn't it 

All those ch&acircumflex;teaux you went to visit 

Mm

Yes we went to various places uh  Foug&egrave;re Fleur  uhm  Ch&acircumflex;teau O  owned by the O family

Mm

O 

Oh O with a circumflex over the top

Oh yes

Yes that 's

I think that 's right 

I 've seen that yeah

One ch&acircumflex;teau we went and looked at

And uh  we didn't actually go inside

We just walked round the ground

And someone came and locked the gate after us

I think perhaps the gate was left open by mistake and we weren't supposed to 

It was a fourteenth or thirteenth century ch&acircumflex;teau and we just sort of wandered in

Had a couple of marble statues

Statue was huge  big tower going around

Really good

Yeah

Oh

Mm

Yes

Yes b mm 

It 's uh  funny

You know my friend John  

Uhm  he his joke name for me is Madame &Ocircumflex; you know 

Mm

I might 've known

Yes yes

Yes yes

It sounds like something out of Proust 

Unf unfortunately I don't have the style for that

But never mind 

Mm  mm

That 's

basically what we did was   went to the Mont  Saint Michel 

Oh yeah

Yes

The Mount

Do they still have Madame Poulard 's place on top  

pancakes and so on

Not on top no

Two of them

Yes

And they they do demonstrations of pancakes as well

Yeah 

We actually ate in their place

A fish platter 

Fish

Platter 

Oh that sounds good

Langoustines 

Mm oysters  whelks black things winkles black shells uh 

Oysters I should imagine

Mm

Yes

Did you have pins to pick them out with

Oh yeah

And what was the other thing uhm 

 circular flat round shells which were

Clams

Clams

Could be clams yes

And uh

Uhm unless they were cockles although they don't 

You know cockles eh

No

Remember we dug for them in Norfolk when you

Oh yes

Well no they weren't smooth 

And uh prawns of course

Large prawns mind you

but not as big as the langoustines 

Doug just had a plate of langoustines

Mm

Mm

Did he

Yes

We had some nice crisp white wine to go with it

Mm mm

Very nice too

Very good

Well stuffed after all that 

Yeah 

uh

Cheeses 

Well not there

Uhm  the best cheese was probably the brie at the farmhouse where we were staying because uhm it was the local one 

It was not pasteurised milk

Yes

The brie

And the butter is superb

And it was very uh 

Well we we often say that  farmhouse cheese some of the French farmhouse cheeses in this country are smelly but this was  distinctly smelly

And it doesn't have such a clinical taste about it 

Rather nice

Yes 

But when you get these mass factories churning it all out it 's all under  highly con controlled

Yes I uh  I think Marks and Spencer 's lets the side down though doesn't it rather because Marks and Spencer 's ordinary brie is uhm very  uhm tedious and and uhm not properly ripened and uh 

Uh but I thought that one you know the brie de Meaux 's quite good isn't it

What was that  building on the corner  just past Chapel Street on the right where it used to be Lyon 's 

What was it called the 

Well it w it wasn't called Lyon 's Corner House but it was

Chapel Street

Well you know Chapel Street

Yeah up at Islington

Yeah 

If you go on a bit you come to  a corner shop a big which used to be a big Lyon 's  with a

Oh you don't know oh

Well as I say I don't know it 

No I don't know 

I didn't know Islington until I moved there but

And it used to have  uhm it used to have a name like uhm  like

uhm  uhm not the Trocadero

but you know how they they uhm they acquire funny names for their places uhm uhm lifting them out of the tea shop  brigade

Uhm no uhm 

Mm

Mm

Mm 

Well that was slightly above the average tea shop

Oh

You know you paid a halfpenny more for tea and things like that 

Oh yes 

I don't know I don't I mean I didn't know Islington at all until I moved there really

Well a uh ask one of the stallholders down Chapel Street

They 'll all know 

Not these days they won't

They 're all young and very wet behind the ears 

Uhm I was down there the other day and I got some excellent salmon

Uhm off a stall up the left if you 're going up

Yes

Oh I know

I have bought in the past some 

I 've bought very good smoked salmon there too

Mm

Much cheaper than anybody else

Mm that 's what I 'm talking about

Oh well I 've also bought fresh salmon you know a piece  like that for that for about uhm four pounds  five pounds maybe 

You know very very good value 

But uhm  the trouble is that uh you can't actually rely on what he 's going to have always

You know you think oh I 'll uh you know I 've got people coming

I 'll get some salmon from the stall

And when you get down there you find he hasn't actually got any and then it throws you into a com  complete quandary about what to to provide 

I have actually got about a pound of smoked salmon in the freezer at the moment

I keep thinking I must do something about it 

You know 

It 's been there a while and I can't bring myself to actually  you know use it for anything other than a  an occasion 

You know I mean it would seem to be squandering it to  actually eat it for one 's own enjoyment 

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm trail on down there

and he hasn't any

Have you been

No 

I haven't been 

And in case you 're wondering that 's not to the loo 

Uhm 

Why have I got such a terrible collection of letters here

Mm

So have I 

And the board 's not much better 

Uhm 

Now if I had an S  I could do a really clever word 

Ah there I go 

Trip 

Twelve 

Oh yes 

Well that would be very nice for anybody with an E 

Haven't got one



Well I could 

Oh this is ridiculous 

Have you got all the vowels 

I 've got nothing but vowels 

Mm 

That would explain a few things

Mm 

No Mummy

You do not spell that 

Got an E 

No 

Could have 

Oh all the same is it 

Uhm 

This is too salty

It is

isn't it

Mm 

Well 

It 's not too salty but it is certainly very flavourful 

I would 've thought you 'd do better to put your S on the end of something like

What  tomb

That or that 

Mm

Unless you have as  ins or something 

Mm

Mm

Sherb 

I know

I 've been thinking of sherbet for a long time but 



No

No you 'd do better to put it on train or

On what

On train  or something  or herb  or zoos 

Or if you put it here you could give it a a W

No I 've looked at that too 

Well you 'd get eleven doing it that way 

You 'd get thirteen doing it that way

But but

Uhm 

What did I do with my E

Well you didn't

You put it down

didn't you 

I don't know what you did with it 

It 's a pig

Well you put it uh yeah you put it here 

Oh yeah 

Mm 

I just wondered what I did with it 

Yes 

Bloody auk 

There 's nothing wrong with my auk

It was the gauge that was the killer in the first place 



How many uh are there

Are there a bag of letters

I don't think so 

No

Not many

Not on there again 

Now you 've got two O six

I 've got two seven seven 

Well it 's a lot of difference

Yeah 

Do ins

at least you get ins and outs

Go on

do I N S 

No 

Don't like it 

What meaning 's ins and outs

Oh ins is a word I N S 

So you get six that way

OK 

No

I don't know what you 're doing

On that

Oh no

No

No fear I should say 

Well do it somewhere else

I mean look

there 's plenty of other places to put it

How about here

Uhm it 's OK

I like it like that

Oh God you just don't 

First of all you don't score so much

and secondly you only get rid of two letters an

and you make your chances of picking up anything better that much more reduced by not you know getting rid of  more as many as you can 

Two four six  seven twenty-four is eleven

I mean you could do so much better than that if you 'd only

Uhm

Yeah

I 'm busy eating as a matter of fact 

Oh 



I didn't really like that sandwich 



I wouldn't have noticed  

No but

You 've packed away most of it  

all the same

No 

Kept hoping it would get better and it got worse



Salty

Don't like salty things

No 

Have some banana bread 

Look

I 'm not that much of a banana bread eater

And I wish you 'd stop uhm bothering 

Oh I forgot

Never mention it again

Yes

I mean you know if I w I know where these things are

If I 'm that interested I 'll ask you if I may have a piece and then you can tell me you haven't made any for months or don't make it any more  

I 've got a whole load of my own banana bread in the fridge 

Oh I don't know 

Do we have sana S A N A

No

We have sauna S A U N A 

Right

We have   

A funny game 

that 's a funny game 

Go and ox

And the ox is uh sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty 

Mm mm 

You 're now eighty behind 

If you 'd listened to me   you 'd only be seventy behind  

Anyway 

What else did Linda have to say for herself 

Oh a lot

Never left off

 

When she 's finished with the kids she goes back to Felicity and all her achievements 

Oh 

Actually you probably wouldn't have enjoyed it here 

What

You mean about Felicity and her achievements is it 

Oh no I 've I I have been inured to that for years

How wonderful she is you know

How she how she talks

You know how they uh got on the plane

They were invited to out to the cap cap

Yes

Yes

And she sat in his seat an and I said I hope they didn't I said I said I hope they didn't leave you piloting the blooming plane Lin  

And uh  and uh she said oh oh no uhm  no

She said we were

Uh she said I don't know why we we were involved with the captain

But she said uh that we were up we were up there

And then she said and so I took took the children with me took the courage in my hands I said and this is my daughter Felicity 

And uh so she said well he imm he immediately uh was uhm all over her or som I don't know

I mean I I don't know 

She she 's a joy to listen to

More than uhm better than her letters 

Captain 's cabin



On his lap



Yeah

I 've long been inured to Felicity and her  pantheon of  achievements

But uhm  I wasn't uh I wasn't put out when she was you know sitting taking I don't know ten O levels and getting them all and then going on to A levels and doing the same 

At the end of the day she got a very indifferent degree which I can comfort myself with  

I mean

Mm

Done all right 

She 's happy

Yes

Well I mean you know so

That 's what I 'm trying to say that you know all these things that Linda sets such great store by at the end of the day  don't add up to a row of beans

In fact Heidi was saying to me yesterday how  uhm  the secretary of her  her ex-boss who was the president of of uhm part of M B C 

He rang her to tell Heidi that uhm he had died recently  and uh  her first reaction was to burst out laugh laughing 

And as I say it makes  you know  well

I didn't expect to get that sort of reaction

And she said well she said  he was one of these men

He he was fifty-three  and he was one of these people who was really into all the trappings of power 

And uhm you know he it wasn't that he just had a limousine to take him to his aeroplane

It it would be not the airport

it would be the airfield

You know it 'd be his private plane and all that nonsense

And uh whenever you went and stayed in hotels abroad and things you know he 'd be worrying about whether the tissue box was on the right side of the bed and whether you know why the flowers weren't the right colour and all that nonsense you know and sort of  busy dispatching people

and then everybody could

Yes exactly

And uhm and she said and and where does it get him you know

I mean all that and he 's he 's popped his clogs at fifty-three and he 's you know not not a particularly nice man

And and she said you know he spent all his time  on this sort of ego trip this power trip

And and she said nothing on God 's earth would make me 

You know with her present job she 's sort of uhm  having  high jobs being wafted under her nose as as a sort of uh incentive you know

And she said you know even vice president so what

She said you know I don't want to 

I i if i if it meant I only had ten years I 'd rather

Mm

Mm

Mm mm

Mm

Oh yes

Mm enjoying it

Enjoying what he paid for

Mm

Oh well most people would 

But uhm  but anyway I mean Linda  Linda gets off on this big business about you know sort of snob appeal  how clever all her acquaintances are and how wonderful they are in one way or another

and I mean that 's that 's Linda

but it is it is a bit hard to take

but I I certainly wouldn't have minded listening to it yesterday

I mean I haven't seen her in donkey 's years

Life is a joke

I 've never I 've never  very much more to the point really



Well she always struck me with the exception of Linda as being one of the really the only really kind people in the firm

Kind as opposed to

Uhm one of the few uhm

Oh George was impossible

Yes well I mean they

Blake 's all right

Yes but even he 's a bit odd really

So OK that 's job one

what are the others

And uh uh I 'm doing a bit of teaching and uh

Where 's that that is at

That 's also that 's University College

that 's just uhm coaching a couple of lasses for B M A and they 're doing some

I mean that 's just very temporary 

And uhm and at the College of Speech Sciences I 'm putting things in alphabetical order for them

 I see

I 'm their  their temporary administrator



D Phil in  in indexing

Yes exactly in alphabetical order yes

Have you given up doing your D Phil thingy

Well for the time being

I haven't done anything on it recently but at the Speech Sciences place I uh have been offered a research job next year which 

It 's not not exactly my particular patch but it 's it 's at least intonation which is quite nice

Will that be full-time

No  but it pays what I would call a part-time wage

Uhm  and can you do your own hours

I mean you can be there whenever you want

 yes yes so that should be all right

That 's fine isn't it

Uhm



When I 'm qualified as far as I can tell  I 'm going to get uhm to do lots and lots of photocopying and funny things like that 

Uhm

Well that 's all right

you 're in good company

I mean with you with your Oxford degree are now going to be photocopying and Sue with her degree is actually putting things in alphabetical order

that should make you both feel a lot better



 

You 're going to be photocopying

And making tea and going out to get the sandwiches

Yes that 's right

That 's right yes when you 're articled 

 no I want to go for it

No you know 

Dear oh dear 

And when do they start then

Eighteenth 

And how long do they 

She 's not going to  it all this month 

No

Uhm how long do they go on for

Six days

Right

Now you 're going out t to France the end of that time is it or a month later

July the fifteenth

so it 's just just 

I said I 'd

They 're all they all break up one after the other

July the fifteenth

Uhm

We 're doing Glyndeborne on the thirteenth  and then on the fourteenth stay with a friend in 

Pippa stays behind because she 's still teaching

Yes

I had this from  already

Yeah

Mmm yes I had

But there was for the single parenting quite a lot of us for this year anyway and uh  I 'm sure 

Uhm

I 'm only sorry that we aren't actually having a holiday in Provence 

I was looking at those dates and they 've only got four days there

Yeah I 'm tempted to go to 

Yeah wish they 'd never written the ruddy book 

What

Oh quite yes

No it 's the it 's the wrong side anyway

Well it 's not that far away

Yes I think it is

Oh it is probably the other side of the road

Uhm

Quite a long way away



Yeah it doesn't really count as Provence along there does it

No and well we want

But the thing is

  is what he calls his bit 

 i i i i is is up presumably up behind uh St Trop Tropez

You know where you go to get to Saint  you go across the uhm

Well where I was

Massi de two-or-three-French-names

Yeah there 's a

But there 's a there 's a plain that the train goes across

I presume that 's that 's going through 

I don't know

I haven't really looked at the map

Uhm

You see it on the side of the motorway don't you

La montagne de 

I can't remember where it happens  

Yes yes  yes

Two o'clock in the morning

Yeah 

I think I think that 's where the layby was in 

Which specific layby are you remembering

 

The one that we fell asleep two hours

well I fell asleep for two hours

and uh if you wouldn't

Oh right that one

Oh yes when you uhm

We did our 

You did

didn't you

Uhm

Well I didn't hitchhike

Uhm

Yes I 'm not very good cos I do fall asleep  because 

 

That 'll do fine

And I can't 

Thank God thank God must do the same must do the same this year and get you some good story-tale tapes and maybe some more adult story-tale tapes I mean



I don't mean that sort 

Has anybody done blue tapes for cars

I mean that would really that 's an untapped market



It 'd be very very useful

Not with chil not with not with children in the back

But I didn't enjoy I didn't enjoy Charlie And The Great Glass Elevator

Is that the one

I look at things and I think oh my God that hair even that glazed expression in the eye just the littlest things are just imposs impossible

Mmm

Do you not think women have evolved to a higher uhm

Oh I 'm certain of it 

In-style life form whatever you call it

Mm 

Cos now there 's an inbuilt it 's a knee jerk response in me is to think I 'm only joking

I don't have to learn it like men do 

It 's a pretty sad reflection isn't it

I know

Ooh I 'm still thinking of I I I just can't let this class down because this is the class that doesn't take place if one of us doesn't turn up and that 's why I got sent home the night when other people didn't turn up and ended up going  to Cambridge 

Do you see what I mean

Oh really

Ah oh

Yes

I have benefitted from this

But you 've benefitted it from somebody else 's 

That 's Mornington Crescent

Now we 're going to go past Camden  and this bus is going to turn just before Chalk Farm so that we need to get out

What station 's that

Hallmartin Street

I see 

What a rush 

Oh gosh

Back to Cambridge tomorrow

Ah que sera

Back back to me me little Darryl

Well now this now don't you need a longer break from Darryl 

Of course I need a longer break from Darryl

Well you should just stay till Sunday night

I need a break of about a year from Darryl

You should stay till Sunday n Monday morning at the very earliest then 

I know

I know 

Yes 

Do you

Mm 

Hmm

D' you know what

I have been without weighing scales for a week and a half now

Yes

Good Lord

How 's that

What 's that done for your head

It 's oh  it makes me want to weigh myself so badly I nearly bought a second pair of scales today



Yeah

I thought Bryn had some

Scales

Bryn 

Yeah

Uh no 

Where d' you think you 've seen those

I didn't think I 'd seen them

I thought I just I dunno I don't know

I just thought he did

Presumed he was a man who

Not in the l nothing to do with him

I just presumed that you were able to weigh yourself at Brin 's

Well a no but I thought perhaps if I got scales I would be able to in future

How late 's Wombles open up

Here we go

Oh shut up

You 're not allowed out

I 'm sorry

Because if we got out there we 'd have a very very long walk indeed

and we 've only got about  not long enough 

Delancy Street

You 've only got a fright because you had a five course dinner anyway

Yeah

Well no

I 've just had a succession of them

I have eaten eaten eaten

I haven't been able to stop 

I have eaten my way round the Yorkshire Dales

Do your do your clothes still  get on your body

Yes they do

But then they would do up if you 're a stone upwards probably

No

They wouldn't

Uh well they would

half a stone 

And that it would be enough to uhm

I think you 'd know if you 'd put on a lot of weight

Yes I think any of us would

Do you

Bryn has had to be my scales for two weeks

He started off by patiently saying it 's just the same Kate

Then he said  bog off I 'm not interested 

I think he 's very sensible don't you

He i he is very sensible yes

Yes 

He 's got no time for Mr Weighing Scale 

We 're not at home to Mr Weighing Scale

Yeah 

And it 's the first thing I 'll do when I get back to Cambridge tomorrow 

Well make sure you don't even have a cup of coffee before you set foot on it

Well I won't because it will weigh extra won't it

Right 

Although I would love to I have to yes I have to confess an often irking thought of am I really really two pounds less than Kate Hamilton 

And I 'd swear that your Mum probably a a part of her masochistic nature has her scales turned a bit the wrong way 

No that wasn't what I got

Oh

Uhm but anyway n no

I I don't judge by hers

Hers are sadistically higher but mine in Cambridge are

Neutral

Neutral

Well yours in Cambridge have always told me the same story that mine have

That 's very bizarre because I obviously lose three pounds every time I come to London on your scales

Mm

No I think yours are about two lower than mine 

But the fact is that it doesn't matter  so long I mean if they weighed you a stone light as long as they constantly weigh you and that 's all 

No

Yup 

She said rationally

Mm

You can always rely on me for good sense about uh weight

Mine continues all right

Uhm though at the weekends  I had because I was on this this silly residential course and things I kept having meals with this are you vegetarian or aren't you

and I wasn't allowed to say I was a whimsical vegetarian and fancied a vegetarian option

You know you there are only three vegetarian dinners here

Where are the vegetarians to give them the vegetarian dinner

They must be fed and they must be fed with their stir fry or whatever it is

And so I ended up uhm just eating sort of lumps of chicken and things

But I do genuinely feel different for it

Huh no

Do you

I feel sort of heavier

God

Gosh

I had a really really good supper last night

It was lovely

Smoked salmon and prawns with a melon starter  and and a waiter who just the minute you took a sip out of the glass replenished it

It was fantastic

And then uhm a little thing in puff pastry with scampi in in a sauce

And then I had the vegetarian option which was a wonderful spinach cheese thing with good uhm veggies

And then I had a beautiful sorbet mince pies and coffee

Mm mm



Very nice

Do you know this is all very odd

If I knew for a fact that if you weren't knowing that you 're not going dancing tomorrow night that this would mean that a lot of people wouldn't know I could go to tomorrow night

We 're  we do we 're doing s very similar kinds of things  at work at the moment 

I wonder whether 

Mm

Uh uhm

At school

Yes 

We we 've got we 've got to as far as the the National Curriculum is concerned

But actually at the moment we 've got a particularly  sort of smashing selection of of dialects on tape 

So we 're trying to

We 're we we we 're sort of collecting those for a start

We 've als we 've also got tapes of things like 

There 's a there 's a tape of 

It 's to do with the National Curriculum

Actually it was issued by the people in the  this time of of  

Uhm and  they went into a they went into a hospital  and taped all k kinds of different conversations that you can hear in hospitals in the wards in in the reception area nurses to patients and doctors taking students round the wards and  and all that kind of stuff

Well there 's some bunch attached to National Curriculum research 

and they they they put all these things on video and do all this with the more or less doing the same kind of thing as you  are doing but not conversations of such of such length  but but more more of the thing that it 's to do with yeah

But it 's it 's well it 's it 's to it 's in order to research what actually happens in in conversations



Oh really

Oh

Uhm



Uhm

Yeah

Uhm

Yeah

Yes

I mean especially with uhm with doctor-patient conversations and all things like that

But uhm did it was how can it how did it tie in with National Curriculum sort of thing

Oh God

Well i it 's the National Curriculum the language element  uhm

You see you 've got you 've got various you 've got various 

Shall I move these away



Just uhm

I mean

Unless you sit somewhere else

Uhm

Y you 're asking me you 're asking me to improve something from a from a  an in-service training that I did in uh January or so

Don't know

Yeah yeah

So it 's it 's to do with the English component

and that group then is it teaching English 

Oh yes the English the English language

and it 's to do with the it 's to do with the  it 's to do with uhm well it 's to do with various things

And a part of this you know 

Uhm but  it 's also to do with

don't worry about that uhm  the I mean various aims  uhm 

How does that suit you

Uh uh 

Anybody else like a piece of anything that they can see on here that I haven't given them





Peter where are you sitting

You 're there 

Tim are you going were you going to sit here 

Would you like a piece of that

Here

Yes please

The the question uh the the questions that that you get with what are we going to use to speak about the language about about grammar about spoken English of course of this time

And it 's  uhm and it 's related to 

Uh we had to we had to formulate a a departmental policy on what we in the end do  uhm  and how we were going to do it

And  this was kind of this this change came about or whatever  really uhm

But exactly  exactly how it was slotted in  I can't remember quite but

but I mean I can I can dig the stuff out on it if if if there 's any interest 

Uhm

Yes

Uhm uhm uhm

Is that what it 's about

Sorry

Uhm

Uhm

 Saint David 's

Here

Yeah

Uhm

Uhm well I I would 

Uh can you manage 

But uhm

No it would only be you know just for sort of personal data I mean

Well that 's one way to spray it 

Oh well 

Uhm who hasn't got some gravy

Have some gravy Rob 

Cheers 

Actually you 're probably paying for us 

Yeah I mean uhm uhm

Uhm

There you go 

I once uhm

Gravy over the table

Just spilt some 

Yeah 

Are you all right

Who needs more of these

Potatoes

Oh boy 

I haven't had any that 's too hot so hot before  

What makes them 

Marion why haven't I thought of this kind of thing

About what

Of having enough scope as a as a three-or-four-words

I have did have ideas about putting it in a quiche

but I obviously didn't get that far

so I uhm 

But it needs cooking so we can see if it turns out all right

Probably rubbish 

All right hold on 

Just carry the tape back

No but it 's three-or-four-words

It seems to me that they they tend to come from

They th think different things are important  and at the end of the day that makes the atmosphere of the  very different  to a boys ' school 

Yes

But I mean

They 're they 're very upper class

I mean some of the things that get lost in boys ' schools are are highlighted in a girls ' school

Uhm

Like 

Uhm

Uhm 

Pit bulls and anthems

I mean yeah

Oh yeah I mean it 's probably cos I mean you know they don't advocate the fact of course that you 're actually dealing with at the end of the day young girls or young boys

And they 've got different aspirations on what 's important as well

Uhm uhm

And different problems as well

And different problems

that 's right

Uhm 

And parents have different expectations about boys from girls

Oh absolutely

Yeah yeah

That 's the old kind of equation though

that thank God is beginning to change a bit now 

They 're not quite so bad our bag

but we 've still got the odd one that comes along and says

well you know I sent my I sent my son off to boarding school

but I thought that as you were here I might as well send my daughter here  

Uhm

Really

Well as as you are a male in a female establishment you know

No no no no no no no at at the school if they  booking

As we 're a local school which is which is just as bad because  only one

I mean  twelve months

Yeah

Local school but 

May even be better than boarding school if you 

Well they don't think like that

Our parents don't think like that

They think that if you pay it must by definition be better

Yeah

Yeah yeah  uhm

Right

It 's funny because much to my amusement some of them send their s send their girls off to you know local fee-paying schools who are you know not nearly as good as we are

And they might just get results and uh

But they think they 're getting a good deal if they 're paying you know if they 're handing over the dosh  

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

There 's a difference between your your problems south of London and mine

And I think it 's slightly something different again  uhm 

There 's an aspect

I don't know 

Well there 's a big

I mean your school is is very unusual isn't it

Oh absolutely

Yeah

They all are 

The one I 'm going to  the world anyway 

Clinging by its fingertips to England

Uhm uhm

Oh really

Uhm

Uhm quite unless it 's still going on

Like mine 

I mean is yours clinging by its 

Yeah 

Is it yours 



No

It 's not



Uhm 

And yours is listed 

Oh

Right well I 've managed to hack a little bit 

For that sort of fencing having just got out and cut the grass would be ideal to make safe

So that depends on how you want to do it

Uhm

Uhm

That 's a bit

Half an hour to look forward 

We did we were we were going to introduce them in the sixth form but the governors absolute

I mean  they they they were all very

Everybody everybody was in favour but they uh more or less they sort of said  oh 

The local girls ' school wasn't in favour

The local girls ' school was not in favour

that 's perfectly true

But they sort of said 

Oh It was a real case of moving your goalposts

They said that 'll keep the parents hopping 

And the the thing was something like uhm forty to sixty by the parents in favour and so they and they and so they said oh well  that 's not a very large majority

We 'll sort of we 'll keep it on hold 

And they uh uh and they

But I but but why

I mean the thing we 've got is getting female numbers

Uhm uhm untranscribable-chatter

We are we are different from boys ' schools

I 'm not really in favour of boys ' schools taking on girls in the sixth form

and that 's it

It would be a very odd compromise

Uhm yes

Uh uhm

Added to which of course it destroys girls ' schools

Yes it certainly does that

Yes cos they don't go through

No

But many girls ' schools don't have boys in it

But they wouldn't go that 's the thing  because parents the aspirations of the parents are still very different

They still look on boys ' schools as somehow better than girls ' schools simply because they 've got boys in them

And while they 'd be quite happy to send their daughter to a boys ' school if they had the chance very few of them would send their son to a girls ' school 

Not very many sons would want to go

They wouldn't

Uhm

Yes I mean although a few of the sons who would want to go I think it 's still quite a big feeling around that that the syllabuses in boys ' schools tend to be better  than they are in girls ' schools and therefore in sending the son to a girls ' school it 's basically uhm

Uhm

three-or-four-words

I mean parents do actually contribute a lot to our local boys ' school by  

Yes

Yes yes uhm 

Where I work in the Royal Imperial College 



 are you taking it away

Yeah i sorry

Thank you very much

Beg your pardon

Your



Well uh i i i well it 's it 's a problem

I mean it 's a l it 's a long  to go

I mean 

Carry on

That 's absolutely right because they 're in order to go

And I cut it up  so that the major

Yeah

Problem of course is that

It 's something I thought that I was the last person to get

Really you want to 

Everything else has been stopped

How about Bernard

 

Murder

Yes

Yes uhm



So you 've already identified lots of things that are interesting that that books are gifts that books are very nice to have about that there are hardbacks that there are children 's books that there are free books that there are many books you haven't got

Mm

Yeah

I buy books all the time for work

I thought I eaves-dropped and you said you haven't got time to read any

I 've read the National Interim Report and highlighted it for these two and that 's that 's been the bedtime reading for the last two or three weeks

Yes

I 've I 've read it as well

And I 've read it as well

Right

The the whole Department has read the National Curriculum

No

I mean yes lots of books 

Uhm  in a similar way always in relationship to the kids as they were growing up 

Books as presents very much uhm 

Extremely important research books that 've been around since I 've been about this sort of high things I 've had passed down uhm  lovely

Uh sometimes books bought deliberately for their archive value

I mean it 's going back now a long time

but uh one or two eighteenth-century books  just because they were really interesting and were cheap when I got hold of them but uh one out of the six of the series that uhm a navigator that followed Cook about twenty years after

I 'd love to see the other five

But uh  beautiful old book

Uhm and they 're sort of lovely objects in their own way

All right

Uhm

Right

Right

Yes

I was going to say  these are this is this is books as  objects

Yeah

That 's right absolutely

Yes

Uhm  I suppose important individual things that relate to the way the day runs

Even though we 've got this wretched document we 're talking about there 's always going to be  an Asterix book by the bedside  or something like that

I mean I 've got a vast collection of Giles cartoon books 

The the first one I drew on is a forty-eight

I must have drawn on it in about fifty-one

It ruined it but I mean there 's a crut crayon marks on this thing

And I I grew up with Giles 's pictures because I couldn't read very well and that 's not I 'm not lying 

I didn't read early and it 's always been picture books

Yes

Right

Yes

Right

Yes

Yes

Right

For the last couple of years

Yeah I mean  

He 's not wrong

Nothing about having books at the bedside though

I think

You know I agree with everything

There 's books as presents books for the children and so on

But I think the sort of nicest thing about books to me is favourite books 

Books that you come back to  over and over and over and over again

Mm

Yes

We w

Can you give us an example



Well yes I mean

Treasure Island

Yes well

The Wind in the Willows

I 'm reading it Treasure Island at the moment to my son

Stevenson

Stevenson

Yes I mean

I I I I read Kidnapped and Catriona  every every few years

I read the Hornblower series every few years 

I come back to uh Dumas every so often and read The Count of Monte Cristo or The Three Musketeers

Things like that

Things that have been with me I suppose since I was in my teens 

And and every so often I come back to them and uh and of course they get dog-eared and so on

so then then I scour the secondhand bookshops looking for decent copies of them  to uh bring my uh collection back to uh some decent state

A real 

Yes

Right

Yes

Right

Is that because you can't get new copies or you prefer to have

Oh well a lot of these books have been out of print for  well not

Yeah

No they come back in paperback but I like them in hardback

The favourites

I mean OK I go in Waterstones or wherever and buy paperbacks and read them and probably cast them aside or give them lend them to someone else and forget that you who you 've lent them to 

But uh hardbacks I wouldn't lend to anyone

Yes

Hardback



Right

Is that an irritation when you have a vague feeling you 've lent a book to somebody and you can't quite figure it out

It 's it 's not there

If it 's a paperback no 

If it 's if it 's a hardback

and on occasion I have lent hardbacks and not got them back

so I just don't lend hardbacks  to anyone now 

And and hardbacks have all got my name inside so

Uhm

Uhm

Why are you looking at me Bobby 

I 've never borrowed a hardback

You mean you 've never borrowed one off me love never 

But uh

Oh I mean I 

Not now because I can't really afford it

but uh sort of in my late teens and twenties I suppose every Saturday one of my pleasures was to go to the local bookshop and buy another volume in the Everyman Library  or whatever

You know

I had a whole list of things that I wanted to buy eventually

I never got through the whole  list

At three and six a time it was quite easy  in those days to do so you know

Right

Yes

Yes

Does buying books still have that the same pleasure

Oh yes yeah super

In a way he was interested because you  kind of there was a kind of feeling of regret

nobody buys me a book and I can't buy them for myself 

And obviously buying books is very special

Can't can't you treat yourself to a book 

Is that a forbidden pleasure

Well I do but I I buy

You mean a novel

Yes yes

Well uh uh uh no there 's pleasure in any sort of book isn't there

yeah a textbook

I I I go into the University bookshop  or Waterstones and I look at the history books 

I don't often buy one but I look at them and I think ooh I wish I could afford it 

Yeah

And do you buy books 

Yes

Uhm

Yes

Yeah

Uhm

I think it 's easy to get precious about books

I think uh uh I 'm uh

You know I c I can quite happily cut a book up whereas some people

I mean obviously there are some books that you can't do that to but but I would do that quite happily to a book

But I 've actually done that in front of people and they can't cope with it at all

They can't they can't cope with





I 'd have trouble

We we were recommend we were recommended to do this at university by one of the lecturers

Cut a book up and  take bits out of it you know so 

I don't even like these people who underline books that you get from the university library and so on



Yes

Yes I had great tension you know

I lent a book to Jill Yeats 's daughter

No I never no

You don't know the story 

This is a book on painting 

and the girl Jill came to me about two years ago a year and a half ago

She 's doing something on uhm  wasn't mannerism something similar to it

humanism

I said well I haven't got any obvious references

what 's it all about

And she wasn't very able to explain

But I lent a book on painting to her

It came back with scrawls all over it

Uhm

Uhm

Oh that 's different cos that 's your book

You should never  do that to somebody else 's 

Yeah  but I

You know Di works in the library

I mean the number that are abused

Well it 's the same

That isn't your book is it 

but I actually remember getting a whole series of uhm books that 'd been in in a sort of bargain basement and were sort of one pound fifty each 

And they were all uh reproductions of a  particular period in art history 

And I I thought great you know  when we were doing art studies at school and I ripped them all up  and John my husband was really upset about it

Yeah

Sure yeah

Yeah

Right

Yeah

Sure

Yes

I can see when uh perhaps the text is  far less important than the visuals 

I can un

Yeah I 've done that

I do it with magazines a lot quality magazines

Yeah well I 'd be as well

Uhm uhm  uhm uhm  right 

I was just going to say about my friend I share this sort of sentimentality with books 

I 'd be far more upset if somebody say scratched one of my records  than tore one of my books

I mean I seem I don't read books for pleasure at all

I mean I think nineteen eighty-two was last time I read a book

and that was because  the utility thing  either uh I don't know university course material or whatever 

I 'd far sooner read a comic  and get far more entertainment out of that

Right

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Would you read a book of comics

Well not really

Beano 

can't



Mr Crabtree

Mr Crabtree

that 's where you and I have definitely

No

Yeah that 's true I 've got

I 've got a soft spot for that

But I mean we we 're in the throes of moving house 

and we just emptied the bookshelves  

books that are probably to somebody priceless items 

Come on

Can we root amongst them first

You are welcome

I 've got a bloody box full of them

Uhm we uh Chris has done that and we 've done that when we 've moved or he 's moved on

I mean he 's done different things and we 've done different things so like tons of psychology books went because now he 's moving on or teaching s something else 

So he passed them on to somebody else

I mean we cleared the shelves and might start again 

So I mean I am in sympathy with

I 've never been a reader you know a reader of novels

I 've read for  for work and for study but I 'm coming round to it now with reading to my children so like I 'm picking up like I picked up 

I never read as a child

I was a very slow re late reader



not for  not for pleasure as such

Uhm my brother read to me  always

And uhm I never read the classics or anything like that and now I 'm reading them 

I 've read even The Hobbit and I 'm reading Treasure Island

Me neither

Uhm

I think uh  on the subject of classics and so on I think on the whole children are given these books to read too young 

and uh so I mean

Yeah we were only talking last night

I was out with some friends

and we got talking about books and things like uhm Mark Twain and uh Tom Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn and so on  uh and Fenimore Cooper The Last of the Mohicans and so on

I struggled terribly with them in my early teens and had no success at all

It wasn't till I was perhaps twenty-five or thirty that I read them and enjoyed them 

And that was the general feeling that uh sort of you 're given these books to read at school and it it can turn you off

Uhm

Uhm

Yes

Yes

Mm  I 've done that with my own children

I 've I remember really enjoying not not the particular classics but Daddy Longlegs  and uh Pippy Long Stocking

And I brought these books for for Sarah thinking you know she 's going to really

And I I read them to her uh uh at home you know at bedtime

And uhm I realise how heavy going they were  and partic it wasn't the right thing to be reading at all to her

And I had sort of had this you know image of of how I remembered

But I mean  I must have been quite a bit older

But I you were saying about books being you go back to the old ones

Now I do that for comfort 

If I 'm sort of you know pigged off with things at school I will pick up Pride and Prejudice and immerse myself in this you know sort of uhm society where everything was simplistic  because all all a woman wants is a man to marry her

It 's just wonderful

and I 've I 've read that dozens of

In fact I even bought a new copy  to sort of pretend it was a a new book

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah

Uhm

Yes

Yes



Unreal world

New experience

Yeah

A new book

I didn't see the news  this morning

I just caught the end you know some Yugoslav fighting 

oh Talking about Yugoslavs I told you about that poster I gave to Vlad 

He denied all knowledge of it

Yeah

Whose was it then

I don't know

Must be a Yugoslavian in the building

But I don't know 

Oh 

I think perhaps Yanka 's been over there 

Which part 's he from

Do you know

He 's from Belgrade 

I can't remember where she 's from 

the other bit

Presumably

Presumably he 's done his national service

Yeah he did

Yeah

Yeah 

I can remember going there and being amazed how pimply the  the conscripts were 

Incredibly young

That 's because they 're young

Yes

It 's the same in the Soviet Union

When I went through Romania  there were guards there as well

They could be even younger there 

It was about four years ago 

Baggy uniforms which looked like they had sort of one size or something to fit every recruit 

Old fashioned guns and all the stuff that  

Mind you there were  that go with us

Mhm

Unfriendly

Mhm

Why

Probably wouldn't 've been 

I don't know really

You get a visa for four days

You catch a train

You timed it all so that you think you 'll arrive  to catch your train on it

and 

And you arrive quite early in the morning and then march off this train at the border to get you know

You have to change your money

You have to change about eight pounds for the day

It 's a lot of a lot of money

But they make sure they sort of they seem to make sure that the processes take long enough for you to miss your train

So you have to wait for hours 

A sort of manip

Well this was in Timisoara actually where we had to wait

In where

Timisoara where we had to

 to dilettante

And sort of riots started there

But I mean my only recollection of it is sleeping in a wood for about four or five hours

Rather idyllic



But it was just it was on the way to Bucharest and  to the Black Sea

But uhm it was very uh

Whereabouts in the Black Sea

At 

I can't remember to be honest

It was like a sort of

Because it was four day visa you sort of spent most of three days travelling  then one night there at this incredibly crowded camp site which seemed to be like

I don't know

It seemed to be where everybody went for the holidays

Getting there

It wasn't Sochi  famous for its abortions 

It 's a joke if you say that in the Soviet Union you 're going to for a holiday in Sochi that you 're going to go and going to have an abortion 

How do you know that

Well because I 've been to the Soviet Union I suppose a good few times

I have but I didn't know that

 to be at Odessa



Yeah

Mhm

No

I haven't been to the Black Sea but I have toured the Voronezh

How long did you stay there 

Well I had a month 's study tour and then three months ' exchange 

Recently



Eighty-seven  

My name is Amanda

I come from London

I live in London

I live in London

I am a secretary

Yes

That 's very  

What 's I 'm an artist



There you are

 's an artist but  normally 

Oh

That 's sweet 

A thingy 



What 's rabbit

Rabbit 





Because a man who 's called 

They did this on the Soviet

They have deaf news you know

This is something that this is Gorbi Gorbachev cos Gorbi 's 

Oh yes it does

Yeah  rabbit 

Can you speak any East European languages

No not a word

A bit of German got me through in some places 

Yeah

I 've been able to use some French in Romania which was quite useful

But nobody wanted to be seen to be talking to you 

They sort of want to speak to you and not to be seen to be speaking to you 

Oh very useful

several-speakers-speaking-at-once

Yeah yeah

They 've got to register contract contact with strangers at a lot of the police stations

That sounded very bizarre 

Quite sad

though we met this we did meet this woman who was an English teacher 

Her son she was desperate to get her son out of the country so that he can get some sort of future she thought

And and she I think had been involved in  uhm sort of political activity in the fifties and she had restrictions on restricted restricted travel I think it was

So she was dead keen to get her son out

I think I mean that everybody did

Oh she just sort of she found him really frustrating because he didn't seem bothered

He thought he could listen to to music she got him when she was was walking when she was on on holiday

Yeah and he just all he 'd want to do was sit down and listen to this you know 

Listen to rock music

Well you can't get batteries in the Soviet Union

No

That 's right

But as she said

Well like I sold a cheapo ten pound Walkman and I 'm ashamed of this

It 's the only black marketing I did for sixty quid sixty roubles really you know

But I mean it 's because I needed to go on a trip for a week in Leningrad

And then I noticed that some of the Soviets in Voronezh who are friendly even if they are teachers of English they 're only friendly with you because they wanted your underwear or your tapes

 my jeans

And a bloke I went with to Russia brought some army belts in  for a night out



Army belts

From our army

I mean I brought a buckle but I should have brought a belt

Belts they sell are horrible brown leatherette

I brought a nice brass buckle

When my brother went there  

Mhm 

That 's probably why you have to uhm officially change your money like that because there 's obviously black marketing going on

Yeah there 's lots

uhm you know if you went to a hotel all the waiters were in on the in on the act you know 

It 's a bit of a hassle really

It 's like sort of ticket touts over here or something 

But then I well I got used to it on the train

Like you say people are friendly to you because they wanted a gold chain or something you were wearing

Oh well I 've never been  something like that

I mean one bloke did get married from our course

He married a girl from the Soviet Union and she followed him

She met him in Leningrad and she got hold of him

He wasn't the prettiest boy in the class 

He was the most odorous boy in the class

And literally she followed him down to  and the romance blossomed somehow

And another fellow who we cruelly nicknamed uh  foetus  

Foetus

that 's a very dreadful word

When he went over on a month 's trip to the Soviet Union

He was at Liverpool Poly to begin with but he was far too intelligent

Apart from that he tried to smuggle this girl back Vera you know in the train com compartment where you 're supposed to shove the luggage

And of course Leda came up

This ha happened when my friend  was with him on a Sept September trip

And of course Leda came in and said

have you seen Richard 

And she said these two little heads were pro peeping down from the top of the carriage

Of course he was caught but in the end he he stole his way out

Perhaps he was twenty-three and been divorced twenty-three three times I mean  

It seems a 

Because he was obviously an innocent you know abroad literally

And th and he went back and married her

And then he changed to Surrey University where all the  people went 

Like who

You know

They thought they were the best  and they should all stick together

and two of them got dysentery 

They were in hospital for a week and I never even got a cold when I was there

Yeah

Yeah

Well I was only there for a week so it wasn't as if I was going to get anything

No but actually you weren't supposed you were advised not to drink water in Leningrad because they they have this special bug  that 's only found there and in Wolverhampton

It 's amoeba isn't it

Amoebic

Amoebic dysentery yeah

But it did happen

Warren Martin got it from our group and he

You see we had a month 's study tour which is more like a holiday and then we those who were going to stay for three months flew back for one week to be debriefed and went back out again which was really crazy

A waste of money but I enjoyed it all  

But he he was sort of ill and came to the doctor 's in in Li England

And he still was not well when he went back there again which was really  odd 

How stupid

Yeah

I I 'm



Nothing really 

I remember going in in Leningrad on the first study tour thing which was lovely

It was like in the  hotel it really lovely modern hotel overlooking the Gulf of Finland

It was completely frozen over

We went in this bookshop

and this man sidled up to me and said would you like to see some of my little boxes  

And I was just embarrassed you know

And he looked at me and he went francuski

You know French

And I said no German 

He went sorry sorry and then disappeared into the crowd you know

Those are lovely aren't they

I 

There 's a lov talking about lovely boxes I went to a shop called  Inga Nice Inga Irma 's

Nice Irma 's

Have you been there

Irma 's

I 've seen it

Presumably you 've been inside

Oh I went in today

It has a sale 

I found fandabbydoozy earrings  and some really nice uhm



It 's probably Mortimer Street

I don't know the name of the road because I didn't look but it 's not far from Charlotte Street

It 's very near Astor College

Uhm just behind you know at the back of Tottenham Court Road there

Uhm it has some really nice it had a lovely wood letter-rack and a sort of in-tray done in wood which I fancied despite the fact I haven't got anything to put in it

They 've got good stuff there you know and that African stuff

Yeah I mean it 's sort of yeah and Asian stuff

There is you know like those that cashmere rug I 've got on my wall

Mhm

Things like that

 and lots of cards 

Well I 'll have to go down to Irma 's and spend some money

Yes

I was I was clinging on to my purse when I was in there

It was quite nice 

So have you just started at the Survey 

Yeah

Uhm



No I 'm just doing a project for my course over the summer

What course

One year computer science course

Oh no



Yeah this is the final part 

This is all right

It could be 

The Survey 's  more interesting than a lot of things people are doing

Mhm

Mhm

What are other people doing

Things I don't understand really

In what department though

A lot of people are doing things which are just within the Computer Science Department ideas that other lecturers have had

And people are doing stuff in the Psychology Department

Mhm 

Anyone doing anything in  Wolfson House in the acoustics bit

I don't think so

No 

They 're not great social animals computer computer scientists

Aren't they

Mm

Generally lack social skills sitting all day in front of a screen 

all day 

Yes pressing buttons 

Well uhm  uh certain maniacs transmit by electronic mail uhm binary encoded pornographic pictures

Really

But they are encoded

So it 's when it 's when I receive them it just looks like uhm  uhm  garbage uhm lots of dollar signs and things

But uhm you know if you 're a software freak you can no doubt uhm  find out what they 're of

Yeah

Really

What

Do you send electronic mail to people that you know though

Yes and that I don't know

Uh 

It 's quite marvellous because because it 's uhm it 's glo it 's global 

Yeah excellent

I 'm sure you would love it if that is well I mean

I don't know if you if you if you if you like writing as much as talking

Yeah yeah

I mean that 's why I like faxes 

Yeah

Of course it 's it 's entirely possible to waste your ent entire working day on it

It 's like sending faxes from work 

I mean no one really minds a few times

But the thing is you always have to write them in a slight code so people don't know exactly what you are talking about and uhm 

And it 's uh you know so so that if a financial director comes in and happens to read it then you know you 're in the clear

Uhm  yeah they 're really good

Really nice 

I was really waiting for the moment for people to have faxes at home  because you can write really good messages  and fax them

whereas when you call somebody up you have to go hi how are you

and they go I 'm fine how are you what have you been doing you know

whereas on a fax you can just send a really good message and a picture pictures of other people and pictures of you 

You send pictures of you

No I don't send pictures of me

Other people send pictures of me I 

I send pictures I like

Like like this friend of mine Andy

I always send a picture of uhm Andy Warhol

I get an Andy Warhol card from the Tate like a self-portrait thing and just copy it and then I fax it through to him so it just says to and then he 's got this picture of Andy Warhol 

You could I suppose commission some prints of you yourself

Uh

You could commission prints of yourself

Yeah but I can't afford that kind of thing

How much  could you afford

Uh  I don't know

No nothing really

I 'm I 've got too many debts 

Uhm  uhm



I thought about having

My sister and I were going to get a picture of of she and I done

Well we 've been meaning to do it through this friend of mine who 's a photographer for about  four years

Just never got round to it

For my mum and dad

Bi Bim and I always planned to have to have some done based on on uh photos of Auden and Isherwood 

Really 

Yes but I I think uh  uhm  we don't look  we don't look as uhm  as spruce and uh  elegant and uh  as pure especially good-looking like him

Who would be who

Uhm uh I don't know 

But uhm  I suppose we 're not really like either of them

No I mean Auden was extraordinarily ugly

When he was young

only when he was old because he had this skin disease

When he was old yeah yeah

but never never

He always he was always fairly ugly

He 's got a wrinkled old face

And when he was old it got really sort of craggy

Really

Yeah very ugly

Yeah he had some sort of disease undiag

undiagnosed I I believe

So he had these great big big cracks in his face 

I mean extremely deep wrinkles 

Is Bim at the Slade now or not

Did he ever get there

At Camberwell

Oh Camberwell

Uhm

Uhm  had an exhibition which I forgot to invite you to

Really

Yeah

Just didn't sell anything you know  uh

Do you think uhm he 's really good 

Uh  well uh I think he is really good

I mean as a as a sort of

Not not his pictures yet 

Do you think he has it in him

Yeah 

I don't think there 's anybody uhm

There 's just

There 's no one

There 's no uhm

Well my impression of the pictures I saw at the exhibition was that there wasn't uhm he wasn't filtered uh by an actual filter

But he was just painting what he wanted to paint  and

and the quality was variable

And there was no one standing around say saying to him you should junk this

And and well you know

Uhm and and

Uh so some of it wasn't was not very good quality

Yes

Uhm

Uh I c I mean uhm I can sort of read it to see because I I knew his life the personal uh signification significance of the pictures

but I don't think uhm that anybody else would

Yeah 

Do you still see Leo

Yeah

How 's he

Fairly OK I think

Really

Uhm

Does he live out of London

Yeah he went to live in he went to uh Colchester

He 's training to be uh don't know what you call it sort of the step above uh an E F L teacher

Really

Uh a sort of cour course director I think it is

Is he still writing

Well still isn't really the word

It it stopped around uh

I know he stopped years ago

Yeah

But is he writing at all

Again

Yeah 

No

No

So he 's not interested in it

Oh yeah yeah he thinks of himself as a writer

He ju just doesn't write

Except he doesn't write

Why doesn't he write

I don't know

I don't know

I mean I think of myself as a non-smoker

Uhm 

Well why doesn't why doesn't he

Is he happier when he did than he used to be

Happier did you say

Uhm

No

Unhappy

Oh he 's fairly happy 

Uhm 

Why do why do you think he doesn't write then

Does he not have the time

or do you just think he 's not 

I don't know

I mean I think really uhm  it 's very difficult to to to produce any form of art unless you are driven 

Yeah

Uhm

But does he does he not just like write for himself

Internally driven I meant

No he is not no 

Yeah yeah 

Uh  I don't know though

Uh He he he 's uhm he 's uhm working on his language 

How do you mean

Well he he and I invent lang lang languages

Each of us have our our own languages

Can you understand each other 's languages 

Uhm  well

Well is it a re is it recognisable

I mean is it complete nonsense or is it just a language 

Oh it seems just like Turkish or something like that

Uhm

Like Turkish or something you know

It 's like Turkish

Well it 's not actually like Turkish but I mean

Can somebody understand it

Is it is it just stupid English

Oh no no no

It 's another language

Yeah it 's another language

Uhm he can't understand my language because in my language at the moment there aren't uhm there 's no the words aren't matched up with the sounds so he can't actually speak or write any 

So it 's just like 

Yeah well I 've written down bits of the grammar and the phonology  and the semantics but it 's not all merged into a lexicon 

Yeah

Uh but his uhm his

I thought you meant

I thought you meant language like a language like you know you have different

like don't you have different languages that you speak to different people

You know well certain certain parts of it that other people wouldn't normally understand

Oh I see

Sort of like jargons slangs

Sort of

Yeah

Yeah

No no no no

It 's a it 's a completely different la language

I mean a real language

Yeah yeah yeah yeah so

As different from English as Turkish is

Uhm that was what I meant when it 's like Tur Tur Turkish and uhm 

Well  I uhm

There 's a 

His his  his language is called Yathoyua and there 's there 's a dialect of it dialect of it that I speak or that that I write anyway called Dham Dhamyathua

And how do you know

How do I know what

How do you know how to write it

Uhm  well I 've learnt it

From him

Yeah

Right

And uhm so I 've I 've written a few short texts in it like the Lord 's Prayer I 've translated

Really

Yes

Uhm uh  but we don't actually converse in it

Uhm

Because you can't

I know you can't converse in yours

You can't converse in mine

Does he know does he know anything to do with your does he know a dialect of yours

Well as I say you can't speak it because it hasn't actually got like a dictionary

Oh right

Well could you think in your language

Oh I can think in it yeah

Can he

No

Because of it 's it 's so unlike normal natural language that uhm I find it extremely difficult to explain to anybody how it works

Uhm 



Uhm uhm I don't know

I actually I thought I think you can have as much another language just just just in English

Yeah

I think you can have well not as much you can have

you can have quite a different language where things mean different things just as in English

Uhm  but that 's only only part of that has changed

I mean basically it 's the same

The phonology and the syntax would be the same 

Uhm  and all the uhm

So uhm  I mean really the probably the most famous example of what we do is Tolkien 's invented languages

Do you know do you know Tolkien

Yes

Yeah yeah

Yeah

Yeah I hated it

Ah yes yes

Well actually no I quite I don't really like Tolkien

I I thought of bringing you a book as an apology for cancelling

But all I could remember you liked once was Kathy Acker and Jack Kerouac

And I thought you might your taste might have changed

I still like Jack Kerouac

In fact I re-read most of them quite recently because you know Ape Ape my ex-boyfriend

Yeah

Uhm

He got really into Jack Kerouac so I gave him a Jack Kerouac book when he went away 

And then when he was in San Francisco this was like you know certain books were set  in San Francisco he got really into it

And uhm  he 's bought loads of them now and I read them

Uhm

In fact there was that

I remember the other day

who was I talking to

Oh I remember I was talking to this bloke Mark some sort of  this really old friend of mine 

And  I must have been looking through one of my old notebooks from Cambridge or something before I was telling him about it

There was this bloke in the in the cafe in Cambridge called the Steps really weird OK

The cafe or the bloke

The cafe was called Steps or the bloke

What

The cafe was called Steps

The bloke was called also something like

oh I can't remember what

Where whereabouts was it

It was just by the market  just down some steps

It was just you know the market in Cambridge it was yeah

What in the Kite 

I don't know

Or in the middle of town

In the in the middle of town

Oh right

So books

Are the are they important  to you

If you were a castaway on a desert island which eight books would you take with you

Eight

No no 

Oh you mean one each  

Uhm 

Which books would you take

I 'd take Nelly Kelly or my cross-stitch book

Yeah my cross-stitch book

Right

Uhm

No good taking a cookery book is it

That that 's serious

That 's a what

Yeah

I don't know

It 's it 's a reference book  is it

Which

your cross-stitch book

Yes

Yeah yeah

It well it shows the

I 've got well between us we 've got quite a lot of them uhm showing you all the different things to do with cross-stitch

Right

Right 

So in that sense it 's it 's a reference book you go to when you want to know something

Yeah you go to to it

Uh yeah because you can make cards and all sorts  so it 'll show you each

You get them in different books

Right

Right

I I can overlap to one of my favourite books 

And that 's Hotel by Arthur Haley

Right

It 's enough not enough

I keep watching the film over and over again

It 's really 

I think it 's a really good book

Right

Uhm

And do you read the book over and over again

Well after a certain length of time yeah I would imagine because it was really one that always sticks in my mind

Yes

Right

As does the film 

You got the film on video

Well I 've watched it fairly recently

It was on telly

Right

I I haven't actually kept it

I think I recorded it because I probably couldn't really uh see it at that time but uh I 've gotten over it now but it it really is a good film

I think so 

And the book was 

Oh right uhm uh 

Yeah

Have you uh

No uh I didn't see it

No

I would take uhm Lord of the Rings 

It 's one I 've read for 

Well since I was about eleven I 've kept going back to it every few years

Right

You 've got a copy 

Very dog-eared now yeah 

Paperback or

Very battered

Yeah paperback

Right

And uh

Is that your first copy



Uh yes

Before that I read it in I 've read it in the library in the three versions in hardback etc

Right

Right 

I think I 'd have to take a crossword book and a crossword dictionary  

Oh yeah I 've definitely come down

No I don't know

Reading book

I don't do that much reading

You like

You 'd like to have your cake decorating book

Yeah I could do 

Cake decorating book

Won't be much good to you on a desert island 

 I was just going to say what are you going to decorate

the sand

 plenty of coconut cake 



Yeah I could do 

I don't know what I 'd take

Do you like those that

Marie Joseph I like  which is  autobiographic

It 's quite nice for me

It 's based around Blackburn

Yeah

Uhm uhm

You 've got a lot haven't you

Very good

Yeah she is very good

I like hers or a Catherine Cookson maybe

Yeah

I 'd have to really pick and choose 

Or Barbara Taylor Bradford

Nicky Devlin

Or Danielle Steele Danielle Steele 

Oh she 's OK

No

No

I can't get into those

I can't get into those

Why would anybody take a novel

Why not a  you know a lighter

Well I want to take my crossword

but they won't give me two 

Anyway

Go on

You can have two

All right

And I 'll take my crossword then 

Uhm I don't know really

And a thesaurus

Yeah oh

Yeah  oh 

Why not

What would you take 

I don't know 

Uhm I can't think I 've I 've a real favourite really 

Is that because you 've got lots or  nothing stands out

Yeah

I suppose

No

I can't say anything really stands out in mind

No

So are you reading something at the moment

Yes

Uhm one of Barbara Taylor Bradford 's books  which is so-so

Right

Is that right 

What what 's by the bedside

A book

Yes

And don't ask me what it 's called because I couldn't tell you 

I couldn't tell you what it 's called

But it 's only a novel

I uhm don't like uhm anything heavy at all 

But I like the Catherine Cookson books

And I like uhm  Danielle Steele

And I like the Marie Joseph books  as well

Uhm  nothing nothing too heavy

Something that you can pick up and put down you know without being too deep  because I think uh  well you don't get much chance to read except in the evening

and I don't think you want anything that 's very very  you know

Right

Right

Right

Danielle Steele

Uhm

Right

What what would be a sort of heavy book

To me

Yes

Uh oh uhm

Well

I mean the way you said it 's it 's only a novel as though it 

Yeah

Well it sounds like Lord of the Rings

War war war

No

It 's do you know it 's uh 

My boss had said you must read those books

And I never ever have

War and Peace

Right

I it 's it to me the the

I 've tried a few times

And I 've never got

All I know is it 's Bilbo Baggins 's eleventy-first birthday 

That 's the first sentence in it

and that 's

Well I 've never tried

But everybody talks about them as being so wonderful but I 've never ever read them

Yeah

Yeah

But i i it 's 

I think it 's how you 're introduced to them

Yeah

Is it yeah

And I was introduced to it by having  The Hobbit read to me  uhm at school  and uh in an English lesson 

And then I wanted more

And so we were introduced to Lord of the Rings 

It was quite handy really because he read the short book and we all read the long one 

Very clever 

And uh  again The Hobbit

I keep going back to that

That 's

Yes

Yeah

That 's right

That 's right yeah

Yeah

Yeah

But everybody talks about them you see don't they as being so marvellous 

So I don't know

Uhm

Yeah but there 's another trilogy  which I believe is  supposed to be very good

And I can't remember the name of that 

But I can't get into that at all

And yet it 's very similar 

But I I

Uh so much so I can't remember the name of it 

I tried twice

Yeah

Tried twice to start reading that and couldn't get interested at all

 

When do you read tend to read

It has been said in the evenings

It 's usually  in the uh bedtime

Not

Yes

Yes

That 's when I read

Uhm

I always have a book

I couldn't I couldn't sleep if I didn't read

With Marie Joseph the third time I couldn't  sit down during the day

And I read hers

When we 're on holiday

Right

Yeah yeah yeah 

I mean it 's fabulous to get hold of a book and you just don't want to put it down

It 's it 's wonderful isn't it when you just want uh it to go on and on forever and never finish

Yes yeah

Uh is is marvellous 

So what what 's good about that 

I mean I know it

I share your view but I just wonder why you think that 's good

Well I s I suppose it 's the writer  that uh gets you so involved

Yeah

But what are you what are you getting out of it 

Well

Well I don't know

It must be

You don't you don't want it to finish

No 

Because the story is so good and it 's so well written and uhm you get really into it and you 're very sad when it 's finished

We want to know the ending 

Uhm

So is that that the bit that that you 're involved in it

You take uhm

Yeah

I actually actually think so

Yes

Yes because I don't like I don't like historical books

I don't like uh  very old in the olden times

They don't do anything for me at all

I like fairly modern  well this century anyway

That 's all 

The end of the eighteenth century uh nineteenth century I should say 

Uh nothing too complicated and too old

But some people love uhm period type books don't they 

But uh Catherine Cookson doesn't write does she in  uh not going so far back

Yes yeah

Uhm

Yes right

Well there 's some of hers that are

I can't 

I can't

I don't like her lords and her lady books at all

No but if I 'm read reading

And yet she writes some wonderful other books that I like

Fanny McBride and Nelly Kelly and all those are Catherine Cookson 

But they 're completely different  to the the lords of the manor and 

Yeah that 's right

Yeah

Yes they are

And yet uh I know everybody laughs about Barbara Cartland but they 're fabulous to read

They 're so  innocent

And it 's so you kn know honestly the they

Yeah uhm

Yeah

They are

They 're just so lovely 

So easy to read you know I mean and now they hers are all lords and ladies and all

And from the first page you know what the the ending is 

But there 's just something about them that 's so

Uhm

Uhm

Yeah 

Yeah

I like to read

I always think they are more  fantasy I 'm sorry and I like to lo read about life  you know as as it was 

Uh I like to a book to be real

Oh yes they are

As it was

Yeah

Yes

I suppose that 's really why I don't like Lord of the Rings because I feel as if that is what you create  in your imagination

Well I like the book  the facts to tell me 

Yeah you still imagine what it was like

But I like the book t to give me all the information

With real people

No

Yes

The facts

Yes  that 's right

Yes

To tell you

Which Catherine Cookson does

Yeah she does yeah

Mind you I think I think Danielle Steele does in a modern

Yeah yeah in a modern way

They 're situations that could happen to anybody

And those and those Christian Marion Fraser

have you read them

No

No

No

Haven't heard of her

Blue Above the Chimney and Roses Around the Door

No 

Yeah they 're

But y you still need the book to escape don't you

I mean that that 's

Oh yes

Yeah

I mean y you 're escaping into the book in uh you know everything around you

but it 's yeah becomes

Yeah

Becomes all important

Yeah well not when your tea 's burning

Yeah no chance 

I 'll just finish this chapter 

No

I 'll just finish this book

Sorry

I 'm just stood there watching the potatoes boil over

and I 'm thinking

shouldn't be doing this

when you come home at night and she 's still in her dressing gown with a cold cup of coffee and a piece of toast it 's

Does this ring true 

I know you said you didn't read

Well no

No I don't

I told you I only read textbooks

That 's all uh

reference books if you like

Percy Thrower I think I would take

How to Survive on a Desert Island

You wouldn't have any electricity so I couldn't plug into Ceefax and Oracle 

Can't see the point in taking a novel to help you survive  because once you 've read it you 've read it

Yeah

Right



You don't imagine going back to novels

I mean obviously you do

Oh no

I well I don't much 

To me it 's a waste of time

Really want to hear my voice dominating things 

Why change things 

Quite



Thank you

 Oh boy I haven't even known him for more than three days 

Three days

Four days



Four days

Four days today

But time is going slowly 

Oh very funny

You 're going on holiday

You need a break don't you

I most certainly do 

Get away from these whingeing females and everything 



Cheeky monkey

Right

So you 're going to refuse to speak to me after that comment aren't you 

But we 're being recorded

so I 'd better not 

Yes yes

I think Laura 's got me on a few recordings so  you 'll have to speak 

Hello Ian

How are you

Oh fine thank you 



This is really awkward

Artificial

Shall I go to the ladies

Where 's the ladies 

Oh gosh

I think I better show you



Oh you 'll have to

No

If you go 

I tell you what

go

and ask Toni where it is

Then you can  ask her and see if she 's suitable because she 's she 's Anglo-Spanish

but I think she will still be

All right

Right I 'll ask her

Would she be free to do it today 

No 

But it sounds like you 're going to have to come back anyway 

I mean there 's another two here 

Shall we go and interview the partners as well 

No

Yeah

OK

Yeah

That should be interesting 

Get some  slightly older people in our survey 

And

Actually Simon can't be too much older than us

He isn't 

Nobody there

No

He 's thirty



Do you want to use the loo

No

I 'm sure I can wait

Ear early thirties

Thirty-two or three

And S Steven must be older

Steven 's roughly the same

Oh really 

Yes

I think he quali qualified

We 'll work it out because he 's got his certificates on the wall from when he qualified

I 'm such a mug

I didn't realise that Simon was certified





No wonder

As I say it makes no makes no difference once you 've  

Oh I know 

I know

I know but that 's once you 're in the game 

But uh it would 've been nice if I had known I think

Mm

Yes

Purely for the sake that it wouldn't come as such a shock afterwards

No

Well he 's put his certificate on his wall

Obviously didn't know he was round his office while you were being interviewed

Mm



Are we going to get that fan

The fan will be

Well Toni 's put an order in  today as I said 

Oh probably just when things cool down 

That 's the trouble with this this room

We were sort of moaning in the winter that it was  cold

And they were saying wait until the summer

and you 'll get the benefit then  because it 's the coolest room in the building

Which means it 'll come next month

That 's nice of them

Uhm 

Your friend here does she doodle a lot 

Uhm

I don't know

Not that I 've really noticed

Are you into are you into psychoanalysis 

No

She 's probably

Well not into it

but I would be interested in it

You 're not doing doodles of to represent our characters are you

So for example I mean are you doodling there 

What  what do you derive from it

Mm

Oh

God knows

A convoluted mind I think

Fair enough

 

I mean that piece of paper will only get bunnied won't it

Pardon

Bunnied



Bunnied

They 've got a pet rabbit  Laura and her boyfriend Simon

Oh mm

That 's not a pet

That 's our child

Oh yes

Yes 

If you 're a child you have rabbits for children 

Mm 

Yes

And it uh has a 

They 're not breeding like bunnies

Oops sorry

That was awful 

 There isn't room in their flat for that 

They 'd have to sell one I think

Where do you live

Ladbroke Grove

No

You 're meant to ask me

Laura 's not meant to be talking

Oh sorry sorry sorry

Ian Ian where do you live 

I live in Southgate

Oh that 's right

You told me 

And you were born in North London

and then you went down to South London

and then you went somewhere else and  so forth and so forth



Yes

Yes yes

Yes

Yes

Met this  young lady in  South London



That was  fortunate for him unfortunate for you 

Thank you Zara



Actually this is awful

I 'm sure Laura 's probably told you how long she 's known me

No

Laura how long have you known her him 

Well she usually 

If I introduce Laura to somebody  this is Laura she says

yes

and I 've known Ian for eighteen years

Oh my goodness 

Or however long it is

No

Longer than that now

Yes all right

Fifty years or whatever 

 Except for he 's got a bit of a tash now 

Yes

But he might always have had that for all I can remember

I don't think so 

No

No 

No

That was sixth-form plus 

You mean you haven't shaved it off since

You haven't been bare-faced 

No 

Not   

Oh yuk 

Yuk 

I can't 

I can see this interview is totally putting Zara off me Laura

Thank you very much 

After a week you know it 's really

 

Not a week

Four days

You 'll be resigning

Well it 's la longer than one of your jobs so

Yeah

I was at a job for three and a half days 

I didn't put it down on my C V though

I didn't think it warranted space   especially since I sued the company after I left them uhm 

Just

No

Very wise



You can sue Steven for the fan 

Oh yeah

It 's too hot



It 's really hot in here 

Yesterday the sun was just as it is in India

It was burning

It was

I went I went did I tell you I went upstairs to see if I could get onto the roof

Oh yes

Yes

And

There was a big sign on the door saying no unauthorised persons allowed

You should ask George the security guard how can you become an authorised person 

He 'd ask me why I am going up there

I certainly don't need a tan  

No

No 

Fresh air

Lucky you

Yeah

Now you 've been in more of this building than I have 

You have never been upstairs

The only time

D' you know there 's two firms of chartered accountants upstairs on the fifth floor

I knew there was one more

And the lift doesn't go to the sixth floor

Penthouse suite is it

Oh is it

I don't know but

but F C B 's you know

client reception area or something

Oh 

I don't know

But certainly doesn't let you go up there

No

Well these two lifts don't

The third one might

Yeah

Which is F C B

Oh is it

Yeah  

Oh I could try that then couldn't I

Yes I mean one might 

Hmm

No

I 've only

Are you supposed to record us for twenty minutes 

I never realised how hard it is to talk  especially when you 're trying to

I know

I 've only been

Mm 

Especially when you don't know each other very well 

Well yes

That 's a good way of trying to get to know each other

It is actually

OK Ian I shall try to get to know you

It 's failing

OK

Personal questions coming up 

I can't think of any 

Oh right 

I know his sex 

I know his age 

That 's about it really 

D' you need to know anything else 

Uhm

You know where I live ish

He 's going hill-walking

No

He 's not

he 's going walking that 's all  next week

Well

Well I hope it will be hill-walking

For two weeks

Two weeks

Two weeks

Yes

He 's coming back to a lousy job

I don't mean the company

I mean a a client

Did you hear that Steven

A client a client

He doesn't mean the company

He loves the company 

Uhm can't think

Your shoe size

 

Nine 

Oh uhm

One foot 's slightly bigger than the other though 

Yeah it is isn't it



Why

what size feet have you got

You 're quite tall so you

Probably seven eight seven

Somewhere between seven and eight

Sort of like seven and a half really 

Do they still make half sizes

Yeah they do

No

That 's the problem not in a lot of styles 

Oh

They do in Marks and Spencer 's

And you 're going there after here so

Do they

I could pop there

Yes

Zara 's a Marks and Spencer 's person aren't you 

Well it 's easy to buy clothes and rubbish like that 

They 're all right then

I only buy my from there

Me too me too

Sorry

Did you catch that word

And the others 

Actually it 's strange

you know so many people just don't bother to shop anywhere else for those

 

No

I don't for those

No

No

Not for those  

You 're  you 're not usually as coy about the words 

But I 'm not supposed to be saying anything 

     

Oh

Oh well Zara 'll have to say it for you then

Actually do you realise something 

If this is recorded and kept and filed  they 'll find some people from the nineteen  ninety-ones talking about  big blanks 

 big blanks

And they 'll have to work out what big blanks are

And you can get them from Marks and Spencer 's

Yes

Unfortunately I wasn't reading your lips when this pause happened

Underwired or not

Cotton





Now that 's

Nylon

Sports 

Their silk ones are quite good but they 're dear

Maintain leger or whatever they call it 

Yes 

Yeah

I buy those ones all the time actually

Heavy duty jobs

Actually you know what I 've never thought of 

Do men always like to stick to one shop for their  their Y-fronts 

Uhm  no

I wonder if they actually

No

They don't

No

I do vary

Well personally 

It 's not something I buy all that often but uh

They do tend to last

This conversation was supposed to get personal

Right

They do tend to last quite a while  but uh

You can't get much more personal than this

You can be as personal as you like

We 've had some quite steamy ones

Well if you get me interviewed

I don't know Ian well enough 

If you get an interview with me and Toni it probably will get 

Who 's Toni

Toni in reception

Yes 

Oh yes 

Oh that 's right

What 's this ge gossip about you 

Yes anyway what else did your hi sister and  boyfriend have to say 

Blah-de-blah-de-blah 

 Who said that

Oh that 's a point 

Obviously a very well brought up lass here 

A very eloquent  because she 's living with her boyfriend

Uhm lovely



They 're not finding it a stress being in the same office

No

Spent a long time talking about the menu in the restaurant 

Uhm 

Did you go somewhere nice 

Well  it was sort of nice 

Uhm

It was nice

Yes it was a bit

Oh that sounds good

Better than cheese on toast I 'm sure 

Well but it the niceness was in the way that they managed to get kind of every single sort of foreign cuisine into one dish 

Really that 's good

Yes

Sort of  cajun chicken with with French mangetout and   sort of

But then it means that the more the things they put on the menu the tinier the amount they give you

Uhm

Yeah I suppose that 's so

What you should do is order one first and then eat it and then sort of carry on from there   by which time you wouldn't want a second anyway so  

The bargain hunting eat

So all right what did I have

I had monkfish

Monkfish



Yes

Sounds a bit biblical

What 's that look like

Do they have big black eyelids or something 

Yeah has a cowl  

And it chants to you on the plate



Like a what 's it a a Greek a Greek Orthodox singer yeah 

Siren 

Shard  

Sorry

Had to do that 



 

We 've got a recording of us all doing that

We shou sounded so like uhm 

Visibility two

Actually I 've probably got a voice deformation leaning on my hand like this so I don't know

Did you

Yes you 're probably

Your your  uh what 's this called thorax  is probably vibrating far too much

Is



I don't know

three-or-four-words soft in s 

The soft earth of the pulsating soil  from which the juices were running into the young vines

Shut up 



Sorry yes  

That 's quite disgusting

No it 's D H Lawrence 

Sorry we

It 's been a running joke all holiday 



My D H Lawrence was swept away

It was actually

She left it on the sea shore

It was swept away

It was swept away by the ocean

Uhm 

No no no

I 'm sure it was it wa it was that that topless fat woman we saw

It was her  

The waves

The waves of feeling

 

I saw her 

Or that couple

Perhaps it was the peasant wom girl who got it

You know as we were just going there was a girl sort of with a

Was it the peasant 

No I didn't mean it like th that

She had

Or those peasants perhaps

She h she had well she had her head covered you know like a local



But it wasn't local

That was the point

That was why she looked so nice  because we hadn't seen 

she was wearing sort of flowery things

It was really pretty

Mind you

It wasn't local

Oh wasn't it  ethnic

Ethnic but not native ethnic

E F N I K

Yeah ethnic like a beatnik



 Yes 

Or a refusenik

Uhm

Uhm

How old 's your sister

Twe  twenty

Is it

Twenty

Five

Five

Oh same age as this joint

This joint

This biddy

Yeah

Cool age

Here 's the biddy

Yeah

Uhm 

So you 're not going to go back and work in the publisher 's and serve tea  and stuff

No

I don't think they require me

Oh

I think I 'm past it

Oh don't do they require anyone

I 'll do it 

No I don't think so 

No

Mind you I can't make tea so

Mind you

they 're probably on cutbacks now because the head of the company has died 

I thought your sister was going out with the head of the company

No she 's not

No oh

Just an editor

Oh an editor 

Oh well obviously he has large shoes to fill

I told them how much Thomas had enjoyed Trumpets in Grumpet Land  which is one of their publications

Ah yes yeah

I never read that

I was  always infested with Maisie books 

Maisie



Uhm uhm

Getting claustrophobic 

 yeah



You never did get that joke

No   he would

Tried to explain it

Matthew tried to explain it to you you know



Well of course he wouldn't

Come on

he 's only five 

Yes

But come on

we expect our children to understand irony 

Linguistics  never heard of claustrophobia in his life

His mother did anyway

Uh

It 's really funny

 can't imagine Anna-Marie turning to him and saying

do you feel claustrophobic Bernard 

The funny thing th oh yes with her I was flailing around

Yes

The funny thing was Snodgrass who who who obviously did sort of think quite a lot of Charles because he always told  Thomas to go over to Charles to

Charles could tell him the story of of uhm I don't know  Daphnis and something again

Yeah

Daphnis and Chloe Ariadne and Theseus

Yes so

Yes

Go No no no go go and talk to Charles who 'll tell you another  classical story

Better than Snodgrass and the Marble Lump which I was going to tell 

Oh did he



Wasn't particularly  into 



 Snodgrassing

Yes

Snodgrassing

Yes yeah 

I really don't want to have my voice recorded 

Well it 's being recorded

It 's really embarrassing 

It 's been done

Don't like

I know

Just just say say 

Uhm let me find you something ethnic

Can I record over it

Can I record over it

Liz Liz w how would you describe this picture 

There 's a word beginning with D that would describe it

No that 's horrible 

Don't you think it 's quite quite 

 Absolutely pathetic  Victorian  uhm wishy washy

Don't you think it 's quite

Oh she won't do it now 

Everything I despise most

There 's a word beginning with D for you

Oh

Despise

It says here

No what was it it said on the back  

What 

Uh

Oh yes because at the end he he it 's all modern and then

and then uhm

You have you seen The French Lieutenant 's Woman

It it 's it 's parallelled by b an affair going on in in the m in the modern time

Yeah

I wonder if that comes out in the text

Fowles

Now that 's 

Fails 



Uhm

Even Meryl Streep could play it





Oh yeah I forgot about that

I arrest you 

With your big toe

Thanks 

Electra

Electra  you

To the lips ah of others

Those lips have been pressed and others ere I was were clasped to that breast

Can we turn this thing off now

No no no

It 's going to stay there for quite a while I think 

Oh why

Why

Why

I don't like it 

Well just ignore it

She 's not going to play it back to anyone 

It 's just like having a bug in your room 

She 's really squashed the bug

It 's all right Eleanor 

Get away

Uhm 

Quite an interesting little microphone though 

I see you can clip it on to your breast  your breast pocket

Precisely why it 's like a secret agent 's really

Yeah 

I am taking pictures of you now 

Yes

I should record a supervision with John Henderson shouldn't I

Play it back to the to the world

 walking up the  with Simon Goldhill



Oh that was embarrassing wasn't it 

Too  true

When was it

It was when Charles came into the room 

He said uh hello Eleanor and Elizabeth 

Oh yes a-few-words-obscured-by-laughing

That was really 

My god I 'll just tell you something which 'll tease you that I know

I was walking up a street

 

Oh that was so funny

Oh the funniest thing was when I went to wake him up to go and get the plane

And I went in and he was just lying there with these green uhm  underpants on

And I just thought well now where shall I poke him to wake him up

And I thought no I 'll be decent

So I sort of poked his head

And  and anyway he he lay there for a bit

  

Oh shut up 

And he turned around and  he turned around

and uhm he just looked at me and he goes  yes

and he started saying oh what 're we doing today like this

He really didn't know honestly

He was confused because I was in there and confused because he you know he thought we

  complete blankness

He just didn't understand the situation

Yes

He had a one then 

Oh 

Also when yeah he was sitting in a taxi on the way back

You were on the way to the airport

You could see him sort of going like this 

And I  he said uh

he said you know

pay for it  

just looked at these looked at them I mean

Uhm

Yes

But I think

I think he 's also not used to travelling and backpacking all that kind of thing

so he 's not used to kind of having to to suddenly peg it to the

Mind you you can't say I am but

Yeah



And have a

Exactly

And have a 

Yeah

 

Hello dear 

I think I 'm going to go to sleep now  so that horrible bug can not report me any more

But he is quite delightful isn't he

Laura said he seemed to know everything about my background and I thought it was awful

She will not

No the funniest thing was the the friend of mine yeah the Liz I went to India with

Why can't she talk

I don't understand

No no the Liz I went to India with uhm her mother uhm had elocution elocution lessons uhm because she 's very much onto God I am going to build up uhm my social standing because uhm 

Well her Dad 's kind of very well brought up

and he went to Oxford and everything

and he is a journalist

and her mother was illegitimate

and she wasn't very well educated and stuff

so she is all you know

she is a secretary

and she is

Anyway so Laura knew immediately that she had elocution

Mind you it was quite o obvious

A careerist

Was it her daughter

No no  from from her accent 

But I mean it was quite obvious anyway cos it sounds so cultured sometimes so I mean

Oh I see

Mrs Thatcher had elocution lessons didn't she yeah yeah

Nothing could make that voice apart from artificial training

No I mean I think  is quite useful cos it can help you use your voice properly I mean in terms of care of your vocal

I mean I get really tired

Well you could have it if you 're lecturing couldn't you

lecturing sort of

Precisely

I mean can you hear my voice today

That 's from two and a half hours lecturing this morning

Teaching

I was going to say I mean there is only one person in here Laura

 to talk to you about public speaking

Yeah yeah but you were lecturing

No no I was teaching

It was a slip of the tongue in in  I think 

We will come to your lectures Laura

yeah you notice it very much so though don't you between I mean something like

I mean I mean Goldhill 's lectures are so much more sort of stirring than some other people 's

They are just

Because he is so

Especially on the top a mountain

I expect he can then resound to the mountain to the mountains and the rivulets  and the bubbling brook

But  you know what I mean

Well I don't think I know quite what you mean

You are an inventor of things Elizabeth

This really takes things too far doesn't it 

I 've never really touched that stuff you know

Is it it 's like tonic water isn't it

No

Yeah it 's fizzy tonic water

Yeah



Yeah

I dunno don't know 

It doesn't do anything for anyone

I don't like fizzy water anyway

I prefer water as water anyway 

I like mineral water but I don't like fizzy water 

I don't like sparkling wines all that much

Do you

T V 's gross

I like the sweet ones

No I don't

Do you

Yeah

No

I don't like them too I don't like them too dry either

Yeah

They 're all right if they 're dry

Why are you making that face

I don't like them

Well no I don't like sparkling wines at all 

We had a uhm very sweet uhm ros&eacute; the other day

Hey he 's got some tea that bloke hann'e hasn't he

That 's what I was thinking

Yes

What champagne were we drinking

Asti sweet

No it 's not sweet

It 's very dry



Champagne

Don't like champagne either

No

Probably  but I don't think I did 

Well then I say that

Bikers yeah

Oh that 's not the same

Why is some champagne pink 

I think if they put in a a red grape or a ros&eacute; grape or something

Do they

Uh

Think so

Cos we had pink champagne at Roy and Louise 's for their fiftieth wedding anniversary

Pink champagne

Yes

Pink champagne

What 's it like

Any good

Well it was red

Well it 's just like fizzy fizzy light wine really

I don't like champagne at the best of times

No I don't

Whose wedding anniversary

Roy 's and Louise

Roy and Louise yes

They she had a big cake  with uh golden wedding on it you know  with roses and things

Yeah

Seventy one recently uh

Is he as old as that

is he

I thought he was younger than that

Yes he 's seventy-one

Mm

Yes

He 's seventy-one

And uh they had this pink champagne which they did the toast with 

It was quite a nice do otherwise

She 'd got lovely food all laid out

and everybody was eating something

And it was a beautiful day

and she had borrowed everybody 's patio chairs and things and had them all over the lawn

It was rather nice actually cos we were all outside

It was very nice and they were you know very  thrilled with it all

They had so many flowers they didn't know what to do with them

Somebody had been in to talk to uhm Pauline next door to borrow all her vases

and then it was Pauline 's birthday a day or two afterwards

and she got her sent a huge sheaf of flowers by her son

and of course she got no vases left to put it in 

So she came round to me

but it was only Stuart here

and she didn't want to bother him with vases and things cos she didn't know where I kept them or anything cos we were in Bromley Den and I

And uhm  so she was sort of sh when I went round there in the afternoon she asked me round for a cup of tea when I got back and uhm she 'd baked a cake you see and there were all these flowers everywhere in coffee jars anything she could lay her hands on

And she said all I want is a vase

I said well you st still can but she said oh I can't

It took me an hour to arrange them in that lot

I can't do it all over

Oo

Put the nearest one

Tsk God

Oh no

Anne  listen

Do you want cake

Oh no

What 's this

Atlantic City

But it was so funny you know

She hadn't got a vase in the place

Oh dear

And I 've got masses of vases I could have lent her

Yeah we used to buy Mum a vase every year for her birthday

Yes

So we got uh inundated with them

We never use any of them hardly

I mean it 's just amazing

No

Uhm looks the part as well

When was it made this

Nineteen eighty-one

Several years ago

But you find usually that there are one or two that you use all the time and others you never use from one year to the next

Yeah

I find that always

We don't usually have flowers

I mean I got some dried flowers in vases but that 's about it

How old is he now

Seventy-seven or thereabouts

Oh I do I do like flowers

I do buy them

But  uhm on the other hand you only use one or two don't you

Sixty-seven

I did buy a bu you know a bunch of roses but hardly ever a great big thing like like uh uh a ribbon and  sheet is it really

They 're quite expensive nowadays

No

They 're quite expensive nowadays

And I mean I had one or two

My brother-in-law 's quite sweet

he sends one to a birthday or Christmas or something and once a year I need a great big vase you know

I I found this sort of thing I got from Habitat a square thing 

Like a tadpole tank really

Tall square tall sort of oblong thing 

And I have to and it sort of comes out about three times a year and the rest of the time it skulks somewhere you know

That 's the trouble

it 's the storage isn't it

Yeah

This is it

I want to put all our sh  things but uhm 

Oh dear 

It only took us about twenty minutes to get here

Well that 's

Wasn't the road busy at all



There were a lot of idiots on the road weren't there 

They all go to the pub don't they

Mm

They just go to the pub

Yeah

You be careful going back 

I said to Nora she might be going back about two in the night

I don't like the idea of going into the dark but I suppose you 're used to it aren't you

It 's all right

Well I put I left the lights on 

It 's not too bad

Yes

Yeah

And kitty 's there

The cat will attack anyone won't

Oh yes

Well actually she 'll run for it probably

I suppose she 's fully grown now

Fat

Fat now

Yeah

Well she 's not

She 's sort of broad in the chest and she 's sort of stocky 

Just a fully grown cat

She 's company though isn't she

Yeah

She 's very grown

Yes

She is

She has her days when she 's affectionate and days when she 's not but

But all cats are like that aren't they 

They 're not predictable really

But you couldn't have a dog leaving it all day could you

Yeah they even  yeah

It wouldn't be fair

No

Really

Dogs need exercise

Yeah exactly

Well it 's not that

They need company more than cats

Cats can go out through the cat flap and 

Do you let her out through the cat flap

I don't think we want any of this do we

Yeah

Every day she goes out at six  in the morning

Yes

Yeah

Shall we turn this off and

Yeah

Turn it off Richard love

She 's like an alarm clock

She wakes me up at six every morning

Mm

Yeah

Horrible it is

Oh dear

That is a bit premature isn't it

Yeah

Yeah

I suppose because it gets light now and uh  she 's or the birdies start singing 

I was up before her though  yesterday 

Amazing 

Tell Mum what time we got to work

Seven-thirty 

Why

In the morning

Is that the time you 're supposed to get there

No 

Well I I did some work and then we went swimming for half an hour  to an hour and then  I went and did some work 

Yes

Mm

Good grief

It 's a 

It 's quite nice though 

It 's quite it 's quite good

I was very alert yesterday

It 's a bit unlike me 

three-or-four-words

Yeah

She does heaps of hours

Heaps of what

Hours

Oh do you

Yes

Trouble is there 's only me

and really the job the essays I do there should be two people 

Well there is two people but he doesn't do any of them

I have to do them all 

so it 's  but uh

Yeah

Where d' you have you applied for somewhere else uhm

I 've applied to Wellcome in Beckenham

Oh that 'll be handy wouldn't it

Yeah

It 'd b be about a half-hour journey isn't it

Yes

Now funnily enough this fi these people that we went to for this fiftieth wedding anniversary uhm

the lady there

she used to work at Boroughs Wellcome

and she uhm  uh was quite high up I think cos she had degree

And I think she 's got one or two bugs or something named after her now

Mm

Cor

So quite sort of uh

And yet you come to think of it you 'd never think she did anything like that

She 's she 's a quite a a sweet crumbly sort of person really when you speak to her

Yes

You 'd never think she did anything so scientific

I dunno don't know whether you can carry any more to get through the door can you

Fluffy

I can just about carry it

Mind you

don't drop it off Stuart please cos of my new mugs 

Careful Stuart

Thank you

And where else

Oh Nottingham

A job in nu University of Nottingham

Oh God d' you want to go up there

Well I i it 's cheaper up there

We are seriously considering selling the house

Mm

Are you really

And moving up north

Mm

Because

The only thing is is at the moment Helen it 's an awful trouble to sell

Yeah this is it

So e if I get the job I 'll rent for a while until the house prices pick up but

Mm

That 's an idea

Yeah

Because that way I mean if I know Peter and I could buy a house each  you know and then have ready cash as well



Yes

You 'd be able to afford it up there wouldn't you

Yeah 

I mean we 'd take out a little mortgage

Yeah

I mean you wouldn't necessarily need a house

I mean a flat or something would do you each wouldn't it

Yeah exactly

Is it your brother who knew Peter

Yes yes

He 's he used to go about with Peter

Peter yes

My brother my brother

Obviously was yeah

He 's my age isn't he

Yes 

Oh God how old is he

He 's oh twenty-eight

Yeah

Twenty-eight

Same as me only a few months younger

Mm

Yeah

He might be

When 's your birthday

Seventh

April 

I always forget his birthdate

It 's June 

I think

Two months younger

Yeah

Yeah

I always forget

Are you planning to move to a new flat

You got to have the money though haven't you

Yeah this is it

Well if she sold the house they 've got at the moment

You see they live in she lives in her mother 's house at the moment

so  she would have it then 

but

Mm

Yeah

Dunno don't know

What about the father

He living with you

Oh no

No not now

No

What 's happened to him then

Dunno don't know

Don't care 

Oh 



Can you wash those few cups up uhm Rich Stuart please

Least you it 's good news for you though innit isn't it

I mean  at least you 're getting  right yeah

Yeah

It 's nice and quiet

I 've got it all to myself and the cat

It 's really good

Good luck to you

Yeah

We could have wild parties and things

I see

Well I could have parties and things

She 's planning one

Are you planning parties

She 's planning a wild party aren't you

Yeah

Given half a chance 

Haven't got enough people though

They don't want to come down from London

It 's too far I think

Uhm

That 's the trouble if you 're out a bit isn't it

Yeah

I mean it 's s b tuks through the Blackwall Tunnel it 'll probably take about half an hour or an hour

Well that 's like your friend Ruth who  lives with someone

I mean she lives out in the wilds somewhere

She sort of keeps asking them to things but that was twice she 's asked them to things hasn't she

And I mean it 's you know a bit difficult for people to get there

That 's the trouble

Well actually the thing i is it 's not even particularly far

It 's just the travel

Yes

The difficulty is the travel

You know it 's all right if you 've got a car but

I mean i it was

you have to go to Cambridge and get the village bus out

And it took over three and a half hours to get there and over three and a half hours to get back and uh probably four all told

Involves getting the tube

so

Not worth it is it

No

Certainly wasn't worth it

No

I met a girl on the train today

Oh 

You picked up a girl on the train

I did not pick her up

I met her

Sorry

Uh you met a girl on the train

What 's the difference between meeting and picking up

Well she 's not here 

Oh I see 



I I met her and 

You picked her up and dropped her did you

Picked her up and dropped her yeah

Only to pick her up again

I hope 

Oh well if you 've got her telephone number you picked her up

Did you get her telephone number

I got her phone number

Oh well you picked her up  it all yes 

You picked her up

Uhm I 'm sorry everybody then

it looks like that was a that was a definite pick-up then 

What sort of a girl is she

Well

Is she Chinese

No she 's English

She 's the first English girl I 've spoken to for about three or four years I think

A very strange feeling

It 's an English girl

Yes quite

What sort of English girl

Very very frightening  saying

but she



Oh absolutely and you know so much about them 

Yeah

Even more frightening than knowing they can understand what you 're saying

That 's what I said

Oh I see I thought you said it was very frightening being able to understand what they were saying

Yes they they know too much about 

Yes

Uhm 

Yes the English are branded on their tongue as they say don't they so uh as soon as you speak you know they usually know what an idiot you are

So this one was  lower middle-class in that case

In Chinese I know even more 

But what about A one B two  as grouping uhm

I 'd say she was probably a B two  or maybe a B one

Uhm

Pity 

She 's a student at Saint Martin 's I think

Is she

Uhm 

B one means she 's she 's pretty sort of

Are you talking about appearance now

No

How would you go about uh   her

On appearance

This is class evidently

Class class  

Uh s start with class

three-or-four-words

Yes right

That 's right isn't it

Yes yes so that 's it

Yes yes that 's right

We were estimating her income

I mean if she 's a student at Saint Martin 's she would would presumably be covered

No no but I 'm saying if she had

Mi Michael 's so   accent and so on

  attention 

It 's what she earns

Her parents get

Yeah

Yes one 

uh and appearance

Appearances don't go A one and A two

It goes on a scale from one to ten 

Right

Where was she

And she is four and a half five 

That 's pretty good

I 've heard that 's very good and uh uh i it 's a very

it 's a very hard

Not bad

Uh uh uh what do you mean below below half way down the ratings

Yeah just 

There 's a very severe judge this

I should imagine he is yes yes

Nobody here is above eight

Being one of the beautiful people himself he uh has these high standards 

Anybody that 's got an eye each side of their nose and can walk around to me is a is a tremendous beauty he says 



Tha tha tha that 's three-or-four-words

Anyway anyway anyway Louis tell us some tell us more about her

I don't know much about her

I 've got her phone number right here

The thing is what 's the etiquette of this

You 're then meant to wait a couple of days before you ring them up or else it appears uncool you know



Ring her tomorrow and invite her out

Just say I happen to be going to the theatre and I have two tickets

Credit line

Is that all I say

Yeah

Well there 's there 's there 's

Don't ask me what you say

You 're the expert at this

There 's the stri there 's the strike while the iron is hot policy 

And there is the other policy adopted by a friend of mine who always lets thirteen days pass

Thirteen days he calculated would would would allow uh allow uh as it were just allow such expectations like boredom with it uhm melt into a vague disappointment 

So whoever  however attractive she was he counted off thirteen days and then rang her



Yeah



I I would be afraid that in thir in three days she 'd have forgotten all about me let alone thirteen 

Ah you see

the danger is uhm he 's not like Louis of course and more like me a sort of person that would uhm  would uhm  would find it hard to uh ba be attractive

so if  he always felt that he he he 'd

This good-spirited 

Person 'd be intrigued by the thirteen day gap

She 'd be so confident she 'd got him

that he 'd ring

she would hesitate whether to  him

Uhm

Uhm

But that sounds as if he had uh he was blas&eacute; slightly blas&eacute;

  

Do you want to appear blas&eacute;

I don't know 

Ring her tomorrow

Can you appear blas&eacute;

Do you think that someone from this particular socioeconomic group 

Uh I don I don't know

Or is she so used to that  that the sort of direct D D three approach mi might be more effective you know so 

She 's sitting there at this very moment saying why doesn't he ring me at this moment 

Yes of course

If you rang her now she 'd say yes Louis

I bet you ten quid on it

I mean it

I hope she doesn't work at this institute  or this institute

There 's the plot of a novel there 

Not quite

There is a novel

Or a short story

There is a short story

A crime novel

It 'd be a murder story 

I think there 's a Barbara Cartland romance actually 

Four and a half he called me she quavered 

Surely it couldn't have been him from lake thirty-five 

Yes 

Can I set it in Regency times  

I 'd have the equivalent of a stage coach or something 

Don't think their picking up was quite the same was it 

Have you I mean it it it

What do they do

I don't know I mean

Well I mean say eighteenth century uhm relationships between men and women were very different because if it was a low class woman

and we have a precedent of uhm from Boswell 's uhm London Journal  where he comes out of Saint Paul 's Cathedral after being elevated by uhm a very fine sermon and determined to better his life but unfortunately meets a trollop at the bridge  and then and then goes home regretting that he had not brought a sheath with him and fearing they were going to be

Uhm 

He does invari if I remember Boswell 's London Journal he almost invariably does

Yes he 's endlessly getting 

Has thirty days on mercury cures

three-or-four-words very painful for

That 's right

Straight after the Dean 's sermon as well

Yes uhm 

God it must 've been awful in those days

Well yeah 

How would you arrange these things without a telephone

I was wondering that 

What did they do

I think people moved in a much smaller circle then i in those days though 

I don't know what they did

Uhm

Well they dropped cards in I suppose the doors

Or was that nineteenth century

Wonder what people do now

I think that 's more nineteenth century

Uhm 

How did men arrange to be with women whether they were unmarried or married 

Below them I mean

Who knows

Cos they did didn't they c c there was

there was certain intimacy in the eighteenth century

People were in

Johnson certainly uh s sat with Mrs Thrale a long time and whatever in intimate conversations 

Uhm

It was more like now than the nineteenth century was

three-or-four-words

Uhm I think the nineteenth cent

Well that 's that 's it depends very much what uh again what class you were in and 

The whole  

And where you were

It would be the equivalent of talking to a girl on the stage between uhm Dover and London 

But I don't 

It 's difficult to imagine people picking  picking women up and

I think yeah 

You get a bit  these days

Oh I know where we were

Dickens

Now Dickens setting his uh Tale of Two Cities has the meeting of the I forget the name of the girl or the man

indeed so uh probably boring both of them uhm characters

Uh the the Frenchman who marries the doctor 's daughter

I know yes yes

Now they meet on the on the packet sailing from England don't they

And all Dickens says that he he he called on the doctor

And I think that was the etiquette

You called on the man  and as it were exchange as many words as you could on the way to the study door 

And Othello of course calls on uh Desdemona 's father doesn't he and then he tells her the story of his life

Yes so you must call on her father quite obviously and uhm 

Yes right

Really

I think I 've got this together eventually

Oh goody 

I hope this is good 

It comes from Marks and Spencer 's 

Bound to be 

Yes oh that 's nice

Does she play tennis

I don't know 

Haven't gone into that yet

Uh

You 'll be lucky if she doesn't 

Yeah I was on the way to see my grandmother 

Cheery afternoon in the old people 's home 

Coming back from work was she

Oh no she 's a student

She 's a student

Oh that 's good 

Is it Martin 's

Is it School of Art

That 's right yeah

Uhm

Oh that sounds jolly good 

Suitable isn't it

artist and writer  poverty stricken 

One tearing up canvases

the other stamping on  

Both weeping uncontrollably 

Do you think that an artist should uhm live with another artist

No

Or can an artist only live with another artist 

I don't know

Robin what do you think

Uh what about

An arti can

does an artist have to live with an artist 

Does an artist have to live with an artist

Yes

What happens

I don't see why

Uh do do they have to or can they

Brow well uh Browning and uhm and Emily you see lived together



Browning and uh

Uh not Emily uhm 

Elizabeth 

Elizabeth

Uhm

Uhm 

Turner lived very happily with 

I don't know

I think artists have sort of great uhm  understanding of women

 

Bank managers

Right I 'm going to dish this up now 

No I think I would certainly want to live with someone that could understand one 's own angst and anxieties

Uhm 

Some bright breezy soul would be a nightmare in  

Yeah maybe 

I think I don't want to live with anybody at the moment actually 

You don't want to live with them

You 're not a neurotic wreck on the other hand uhm

No no 

Anyway it 's nice to have met her

Uhm 

So how 's it going with this rewrite 

Uh well I don't know about calling it anything like that uh 

I 'm not utterly at the bottom of the road uhm  coconut 

I can only see the book being about a thousand pages long

that 's the trouble

So complex

Will anyone congratulate me on my cooking

Oh look at that

Wow marvellous 

Uh this is comes entirely from Marks and Spencer 's

Doesn't it look delicious though

And all I had to do was heat it up

Over in Italy somebody  who had a heart attack in Italy  and stayed in a hospital in Italy for weeks and weeks  and was had excellent treatment and was just jolly lucky he 'd insured himself because it would have cost uh uh the absolute

You know  all sorts of intensive care 

And fraught

flown back home in a in a in a  in a special plane and the the family staying there in hotels for weeks  and uh the car sent back

and everything

It actually covered the whole lot

Yes

Yes

Uhm yes

Uhm yes

Yes

Yeah

I don't know anyone else who could do it

Yeah

That 's why I stayed in a hotel three-or-four-words 

I expect it was three-or-four-words

Say that 's right three-or-four-words

And I think well I don't know

but it is 



Does insurance cover hotels

I think so

I I think it does cover expenses incurred by the end

Yeah

Uhm

So it 's always worth it

Uhm  yeah

Are we insured 

At last

I mean I was

It seems very expensive

I mean our our five star is nearly a hundred pounds



Is it

Mm yeah 

In fact we had a horror didn't we on the way t to Holland cos we weren't insured just three-or-four-words

And we all of a sudden we all of a sudden we thought oh gosh

The moment we go uninsured

But uhm

Yes

We we couldn't find anywhere cos it was a bank holiday

we couldn't find anywhere open to insure ourselves

But of course it 's the one time you went without

Yeah 

But we managed to find somewhere on the motorway I think at this service station

Yeah

Yes

The Sealink Office  

Yes

Cos at the Olau line they don't have  anything  at Sheerness which is   



Quite incredible we

we caught the evening boat and we got there and we changed some money

No it was at Sh uh Sheerness

Sheerness

And we went on up on to the boat and there was nobody there

And we walked up to the customs desk

Nobody in sight at all

Yeah I thought it was massive sort of old fort there

Yes

They 've got this film on the old Martello forts

And uh  said is there anyone else on the boat 

about eight hundred

The boat seats uh I mean sleeps fifteen hundred you see

And but they 'd all gone on earlier it appears

and there it was completely empty 

so you 've got to try and elbow your way through

There was nobody  on the boat 

And in the restaurant there was all this space and the place and the thing was absolutely crammed

There were hundreds of cabins

And there were still hundreds of people on it but it was so big this boat that you didn't didn't meet them





Even off the boat

You could walk to our cabins and not meet a soul





To complete the story Polly and I got up in the middle of the night

What time did you get up Kate three o'clock in the morning  cos we couldn't sleep

Well it s s sleeps fifteen hundred yeah





Uhm



We we didn't see a single person

It 's certainly the way to travel



We did see a couple of duty crew through a window

It was quite uncanny because we were walking round the boat in the middle of the North Sea at three o'clock in the morning

There wasn't anybody around



Well I wish we 'd booked that to go this time because it would be good to get over to Flushing which is on the motorway network 

Yeah

Right

Perhaps we could have had two cabins 

Yeah

We could have had a cabin overnight and been there in the morning ready to drive away

The going in the top bunk syndrome



And and the thing is it 's much cheaper than the Dover to Calais really even though

You said seven hours

Did I

You said it 's cheaper

Yes yes

In the summer you can take a car and four people for a hundred and twenty pounds

What

with a cabin

Well it 's a much less popular route

With a cabin

Yeah

 





It 's b we can't

Well because we 've already pay I 'd already paid the whole lot you see



It 's less convenient cos it it lands you in Flushing which for most people is far too far up





Is that in Holland

Only just

Only just

But it 's far too far up



Especially across the Belgian border

Yeah



Not now

But for us going to Vienna it would have been all right

Yeah  would have been 

And it it the boats are fantastic

Uhm

Oh it i uh abs I mean it uhm

I mean

And this is this luxury thing

Yes i

The boats are



The restaurants

Is there a swimming pool



Well the swimming pool 's not worth talking about

too small  

Yes three-or-four-words

But the restaurant was so posh we just couldn't possibly have considered it th th

There was a thing called a carvery which had a vast menu and you could

You paid about

I don't know

how much was it

about eight pounds per person

and you could you could have anything you wanted as many times as you



Help yourself  

And it was just   because



And even the help-yourself  was nice

Yeah

Mm

Mm

Now that 's why you shouldn't worry about Tamsin and Damian coming together cos from Rebecca 's point of view  it would be a godsend

Oh it would uh it would be a great blessing if they can s they can s speak for a half an hour or something

it would be

Oh good

Cos they can make her feel easier because I think she feels she 's being rather an intrusion



Well will you tell her that you might save Rebecca from complete despair because being exposed twice within a month would be rather awful for her

I mean who did you say you s found in Scotland

Yeah

I mean it would be nice 

Just have somebody else to talk to really 

Have a game of table tennis or something

Well our friends from Broadstairs the one the one who 's moving Pippa

Clare 's friends the one who 's moving Pippa

Pippa

What were they doing up there

They had a holiday

They just they booked a holiday in Scotland not knowing where we are going at all

Well they just hired a cottage

Cos we did it sort of rather last minute

Oh I see

And we landed up within  how many miles of each other

Thirty

Twenty

Twenty twenty-five or so miles

Mm

Mm 

So that was very successful 

There 's a little motorway here goes through Brussels  Li&egrave;ge Aachen

That 's very quick all that route down there

Is it mm

Mm

Stuart said it would be about  uhm  four hours

Four hours

Yes 

It 's a very fast road all the way

Mm 

I think it actually goes through Brussels doesn't it the motorway



Yes

Well there 's a ring road

Mm

Yeah

Just wondering who we who we can persuade to swap with us next year maybe



Mm 

Cou aren't you going to do it through an agency then

Well

No

Why not

We might do but

Well cos we 've always done it through personal contacts

What about those Norwegian people

Oh once th the Dutch people 's agency 

We 've found everything 's so difficult to work out cos ne although you 've got lots of offers there was never any guarantee that they wanted your place all at the same time or or the facilities that you had or 

It didn't it it was

The Dutch one

Well there were so many Dutch people wanting to come here that you could have had almost anything

We weren't always

We have 

Uhm

Yeah or that you match

The Dutch was nice

And that actually worked out very well

It did because we didn't really want to go to Holland and certainly not to northern Holland which is not near all the famous places 

But it turned out to be lovely with a huge sort of lake on our doorstep with developed as a sort of plan d' eau sort of thing

Yeah

It was a nice

Swimming 

Oh wonderful

Did you get good weather or

And and it was

And then we had a hot week didn't we

boiling hot

And whole of the city came out

Yes

Hot

What was it like in Scotland

did you say

Hot

Hot

Hot

You had that you had that hot weather

Well it wasn't the whole time cos I climbed Cairngorn one morning and I couldn't see a thing

It was thick fog 

One day we went up on the chair lift and it was bright sunshine

You could see for miles

At the end it began to be a bit drizzly but for Scotland it was sensational

Yeah

Mm

Well we went away to Dorset for a week at Easter 

Where were you then Audrey

What was Easter like

I can't remember now

Not in Inverness

Yes

It was nice

It was close enough

You could I could dr I could just drive to the uhm foot of Cairngorn walk up the whole mountain and back again before lunch

Well it

After Easter

Really

Uhm

Oh

How high is it 

Four and a half thousand feet

Cor

Good heavens

Well just under

Sec second highest mountain

Well higher than Snowdon

It takes a whole day to get up Snowdon

How do you get get that

How can you get up there then

Well there 's a car park

You can you drive up to the chair lift bottom

Yeah about two thousand feet 

And then I walked  and it 's a path I mean it 's it 's

it 's almost a road in fact

It 's quite high before you start

Yeah

Uhm

Yeah

Oh I see

Was it crowded

Yeah

 on top

No

Oh it 's one of those

What a nuisance

No

No it wasn't 

Uhm we were  Aviemore 

I used to go up just on this side and that 's the river if you want to do any 

I

Uhm

Oh I see

Bertie and I were three-or-four-words

Sorry

We weren't in Aviemore which is a nauseous place

Oh Aviemore is revolting just a little bit

There 's the garden there

Uhm

Oh I see

Yes

And that 's six hundred and fifty miles from here or so

When you go to Italy are you going to be doing art

Art galleries and



Well a bit if we can

Uh de depends on the crowds and the heat really 

I mean we uh we couldn't go to Florence and not not see some art

three-or-four-words

Uhm

Actually the heat in that part of Italy is not as great as when you get south of the Rhone

There 's a tremendous difference

Yes yeah

Oh good

What sort of wine did you get 

Which wine

Isn't it coq au vin

This 

That 

No

But you said you were going to make coq au vin earlier on 

Didn't you 

That 's why I was surprised it was in strips

I thought you 'd varied it a bit 

Oh I dunno don't know

Coq au vin

It could be chicken in beer and wine couldn't it 

What

Yes dear

Yes pleasen beginnen



Oh come off it

You said you were going to make coq au vin

Yes Naomi 

Yessen

Yes

Yes hum 

Why not

  have you ever had coq au vin

It 's just a gravy thing 

Well yes

Uh yes

I thought of it like that too 

I did

Naomi thought this was coq au vin

Well you said it was coq au vin earlier on  made with wine



Mhm

Yes

What is it

Coq au 

It 's called uh country style chicken style chicken a la la Ken Hom Hom

So it 's

Oh coq au kitchen

Coq au no country 

Coq au country  I should think

Coq au paysage

No 

Coq au campagne

Coq au  Coq &agrave; la campagne 

What are you laughing at

No no I think they 're country matters  speaking in Hamlet 's terms

Shut up Dad

Well Hamlet said uh uh huh

Well he said 

I think he was too  yes 

Hamlet was rude again

Do you think Shakespeare really saw all these things in

I think

I think people ever since tried to  read more into it

I mean I don't know whether he really did

Was he really that you know

 Yes

No no

I think he tried to

In that sort of thing

Yes

Yes

Absolutely

Yes

Yes

I am quite sure

He was bawdy all right

Really

Was he

Oh yes

I think so

How do you know

Well I think it was the style of humour of the day which    

I 'm afraid I think the I think I think the uhm that chicken is supposed to be a bit juicier

Mhm 

But the rice is very good

I like it very much

You know

Bless you 

How d' you do the rice then 

It 's all in ju juice

Sorry

Mhm

Does this work with any type of rice or only this type  

Uhm basmati

No

It 's juicy

The way you cook it

It 's very juicy

The rice is marvellous  I think

Mhm 

Can you cook any rice this way

I think so 

And how do you cook it 

Well it 's just measuring the quantities very carefully

Putting  a bit of oil  in with with the  uhm the rice and the water 

It 's really good 

It 's done to a turn  not to a  possibly be a  final  alveolar unexploded plosive unexploded plosive  

Sssssssss 

What is it mm 

Done to a T

Oh uhm

No 

No

I didn't mean that

No 

A a what 

Glottal stop

No 

Not ur ur 

Uhm 

Gk gk gk

A uvular something

I don't know

 It 's a turd

A turd mm



What are you talking about you two

We 're talking about saying done to a turn

Mm 

No not

You 're rude

 

Turn

I meant 

Sorry

 alveolar  plosive 

voiced alveolar  plosive  

apical 

That 's the tongue tip 

Mm 

Oh well absolutely apical 



Not yet

No thank you

Not yet 

Excuse me

I hope you don't mind my rubbing my hands

I think perhaps it 's a nasty gesture but  I find they get  cold

Oh really 

Did you have a sleep

Mm

I did 

I snoozed like anything

Mm 

Can't remember what I dreamt about very much

but I usually dream like anything 

Forward



Mhm

She said she thought that the the bag was something of a joke and you might think it was funny

you know great fun

And I said

well I said to her

shall I keep it here till the summer

And I said you said you were going to use it round Cambridge

She said I thought 

it 's really  bought as much for a laugh as anything else

 of  you know 

I thought Rebecca might think it was amusing 

Uhm  she said I 've given it to another friend of mine who said she 's certainly going to keep it till the summer

And I said well I think Rebecca 's going to be  going into her M Phil lectures  with this 

And I said I think she 's going to be using it round she said she was going to be using it round Cambridge

So



Mm

No

I said you were  you know  tickled with it  thought it was great fun 

Yup

Very nice present actually 

I mean she does work out good presents 

Naomi you can take your pick

I wore this one then  Naomo Naomo

I meant to give it to you earlier

It 's a bit late now 

A bit of a problem because she thought it couldn't be Naomo

She didn't think it was Naomo

She thought it was Nayomo 

Who 's this

Alison

Mhm

Naomo



  Naomo

Well it is 

Mm

Bloody well say so

A lot of support does it

Terrific 

I had a broken elbow in my teens but my wrist was very painful 

It 's great actually

Mhm

If you want to take it

I don't know if it fits you 

Don't know if it fits me all that well now 

That 's one thing 

That 's quite extreme

But certainly

When was that

You were given that when you broke your 

Well when I took when I had the plaster off for my  elbow  my wrist  I couldn't I couldn't do anything with the wrist

It was very painful like when your plaster came off

I was going ah ah ah

And he said what 's the matter

what 's the matter

I said it 's my wrist

It wasn't up here at all 

As he took the plaster off I mean it was agonising

I said I can't move my wrist

And in fact he saw me and was very good about m m my saying my wrist elbow 's all right

It 's the wrist 

So uhm he finally

Oh dear

What cos it was painful without your

Dreadfully painful 

And I couldn't do anything for ages with it 

mhm

And I mean I still you know I

 why they took the plaster off after 

Sorry  sorry sorry darling 

Anyway here we have a whole variety of things 

This is something I still just occasionally wear

Or did you have it

I think I had it 

I wear this occasionally but very rarely now 

But it 's difficult to get it right 

This is Rebecca 's

This this bit was Rebecca 's but I think

I 've got some upstairs in my room too

I 've got this

This is yours

I think this is too thin

It 's for a tiny little hand 

What you do is wear it like that 

You try it later on and see 

This was one of Rebecca 's I 'm sure that I washed  uh it does cos it 's looking very ribby so you can cut yourself another piece

But I think that 's too thin 

But I 've got this bit left 

That was one I wore  which was very tatty 

I kept these old things and I wear them used to wear them in the garden sometimes

Dad will you have some more juice

That one

Yes I will

It 's very nice 

I 'm eating Helen 's with that

But I 've got a new one here 

you try them in a minute

It 's very nice

When I 'm riding my bike

Yes

Oh I 'm going to go up over them

Yes 

Now that 's quite a good idea 

And then we can cut it 

As we chop it around into slices

we can cut this back

I haven't got any gingerbread yet 

It 's lovely 

But if you cut it too far you tend to lose the support 

The rice is marvellous 

How do you get it just right

And 

Or you can start the other end  and cut yourself a fresh bit 

You can take these 

See how you get on

That one is very good support 

I found it rather tight 

I mean  try Rebecca 's 

It 's got a bit baggy 

This is fine

But I think you 'll find it 's it 's a bit tight  I think 

Yes

You see  various things with it 

That one is a bit thin 

They 're probably different widths 

That was the smallest one

I think that 's probably a child 's size

This is probably a woman 's size 

So you can try them in a minute

Mm

Mm

Try them while you 're packing upstairs and see what how one feels 

I think on your bike you 're going to have to wear one for a while  don't you 

I think that would be a good idea

Mm

Mm 

Yes

This looks delicious

Don't think makes that much difference 

Very on time 

Well  one of us was

Mm

I mean  you were very on time

You were 

Absolutely on time

Mm she was on time

Mm

Mm 

I was ready at seven

Good for you 

I know you were

Mm

I 'll uhm  sew your bag for you in a minute 

I don't think you can do it very well

You need more strength in the right hand 

Mm

This tastes lovely 

Is this coq au vin 

Mhm

Yes 

Mm

Well I thought that I thought we were going to have coq au vin

It is chicken after all

 No it 's not 

Is it coq au vin

It 's Chinese

No it 's not au vin

I didn't think it was

It 's Chinese

Well I didn't think it was either

but I thought 

 Chinese

That 's why I said is this coq au vin

Mm

I don't know

It 's usually dark brown  really



Isn't it coq au vin

Yes but

It 's a lighter colour in China

And coq au vin is completely different

Well yes

Exactly 

But I just

Yes

But I didn't know you 'd changed your mind

Coq au vin is like casserole with  bacon and

That 's right 

That 's why I said

is this coq au vin

Dad was making such rude jokes earlier on

Oh dear

I said I got it from Radio Four

That doesn't excuse anything

Not the bit about the country

All that larking about 

I heard that on on Radio Four

What

Coq au vin

Only 

I didn't hear it on Radio Four

I did I assure you



 aren't you love

No I 

Tell us about the bishop of Birmingham because I want to know the third line







It 's that bad is it

Yes

No

No it 's not

Don't say anything just for a minute  please  because you 're very courteous and you 'll try and talk

That 's strange

What is it

It 's the wine

It 's Joan 's

It 's the vin  minus the coq

Uhm  you can break into the pears if you want to or have a piece of choccy

You 've had plenty of veggies 

A piece of choccy

What do you mean

Well you bought some and I bought some

Oh you bought some did you

Oh

I bought exactly the same thing only I bought the uh the Tobler version

Oh

I wouldn't mind uhm a pear

Just one

OK 

You know Gerry actually talks refers to my mother 's bedroom as the boudoir

She doesn't 

Seriously 

When she answers the phone she says Mrs French 's residence

And I always thought that she 's she 's taking the piss but in fact she 's absolutely dead serious 

Yes I should think she

Aw

Sorry

We are being bitchy

Boudoir

And the desk is the bureau 

And I think the most horrific thing to my mother is that she calls writing paper notepaper 

I don't know what I call it 

God you do have to be careful don't you

Mm

The funny thing is that none of the sort of Nancy Mitford stuff 

Do I mean Nancy

I can never remember which Mitford is which

But anyway none of the U and non-U stuff seems to have washed off on your mother at all 

I think so yes

How do you mean

Well there 's an awful lot of things that your mother says which are distinctly non-U

Oh my God

Like what 

Perfume  

Mirror

Oh that 's all  bollocks

I mean who who says

Well of course it is but uh

Who says

I 've never heard anybody

Y You 're not telling me looking-glass is correct

Yes

Oh good grief

No

It 's not correct

It 's U

Who says

Nancy Mitford

Or  Or glass

No I mean I mean she she wrote the book but uh or wrote the the chapter in the book but it was after a very fearful investigation of what really U people say

Nonsense

Anyway she 'd been talking to the wrong people

But people do say glass uh I can assure you

I should uh I 've I 've

Yeah

That sounds to me like a sort of you know nineteenth-century thing 

A glass  meaning a mirror 

Yeah all right

Well actually a glass means two things

It means a barometer or a mirror

Oh how confusing

No 

You don't do your hair in a barometer so it 's not really 

But scent and uh

I 'm not but

H How do you know

Does she ca call it perfume

Yes

Oh

Oh we had a long discussion about it on one occasion 

Oh

Yes uh in fact there 's a there 's a tendency towards the nice actually about your mother

No

There is you know 

I 'd never say it to her face

but there is 

No

No

No 

Oh well I have a theory that unless you 're born U you can never talk U

I think that 's actually the truth

I think it probably is up to a point

But my father never said looking-glass 

Well I 'm not sure that he 's born U 

I mean he would regard himself as  upper-middle class probably wouldn't he

Yes

Well there you go

As opposed to what 

Well I mean   U people don't even notice the upper-middle class 

They deal with them as solicitors and accountants and things 

That 's  nonsense 

I 'll get it 

Probably for Peggy

Oh yes 

Five two five two 

Oh hello Albert

Ah yes hang on 

Your dad

OK

That doesn't seem to have a pause button on it so

I 'll turn it off then 

Dad 

Dad 

At least I think I will

Uh did she ring me 

Uhm yes she did

I think it was you know

I pressed the stop button 

Oh well

What are we going to do

Oh dear is it looking dodgy

Well he 's not really but he ha he just hasn't eaten anything for about two weeks now 

He 's opening his mouth very wide just now

Yeah

It 's that same old problem

Oh dear

I can't bear it 

Oh name please eat something 

Oh actually Dad asked me if  Sarah had phoned me on Sunday

I thought funny thing to ask 

And then I remembered of course she had cos that was why we went over

I think that was Sunday wasn't it

Yeah 

But almost as if she had some sort of message to give me or 

Well presumably she called him 

Well she 'd been down there

Had a very good day

Uhm

She 'd been down there on Saturday

Oh had she

Yeah

What

Down to see him

Yeah

Oh 

Gosh

That 's good of her

Yes 

Yeah

Well she is a good-hearted girl though 

This is a very boring period for the transcriber 

Sorry transcriber 

Mm

I don't know 

Hundred and twelve P 

Yes

It 's a lot dearer than the Marks equivalent isn't it 

And I don't think it 's actually quite as good

Yeah

Yes

What uh 

This costs sixty-nine p and it 's a hundred grammes

What What 's this

Hundred grammes  

In fact the chocolate 's almost identical isn't it

It 's uh fifty the Toblerone

Oh there 's so much stuff here

I dunno don't know 

Yeah it 's hard to find and it 's in very small print

It doesn't seem to have a weight on it actually but it looks about the same

If anything it seems lighter

Well has some been eaten or uh

Yeah I know that 

Whoops

Drat

What What 's the chocolate in that one

Uh 

This is fifty per cent 

Fifty-six

Yeah

So it 's actually a better quality chocolate 

So there you go 

Mm

Yeah

Mm

Mind you actually I think Tob 's marvellous

Well I don't know 

How did Peggy get on with her guitar

I 'm not sure I ever got round to asking her

Well I don't know is the short answer because she uh never actually answered the question when I asked her

Ah

I asked her but she never answered the question when I asked her

uhm  I mean I always get the feeling it was a grave disappointment in some way but uh whether that 's

It wasn't anything very much at all 

Yeah

Mm 

I think the Marks is better 

Actually I 'm not sure it is

I don't think there 's anything quite like Toblerone 

That wasn't deliberate

Oop

Mm

How many d' you get

Mm

How many d' you get 

No I meant to put the cream in front of a mike

Oh I see 

Two

Why

How many have you got

Well I 've had three

OK

I had one 

The only problem with that Estelle Road place I mean I 'd still be happy to have it at the price that I offered  uhm is the other thing that we 'll need  about all those places

and that 's the uhm  actual public transport convenience 

I mean you 've got Gospel Oak  Station 

In fact probably the quickest way into the West End from there is Gospel Oak provided you know the time of the trains to Highbury and Islington 'nd back down the  Victoria or whatever

Mm

There 's probably the twenty-four bus

A fair old walk you know

That 's a good ten minutes I should think 

Mm 

Twenty-four bus

Ge Where does it go

It goes along uhm 

Doesn't go anywhere near there

Yes it does

No it doesn't

Yes it does

It goes along uhm whatever that road is called Constantine Road

No it doesn't

Where does it go then 

Well I suppose it does but it doesn't come back anywhere near you

It certainly does because I remember

Yes it goes along uhm

Fleet Road 

Yeah

That 's not far is it

Uhm 

It goes all the way along Mansfield Road 

Uhm 

Well 

Yes

It 's nearer going than coming back funnily enough because of the one-way circuit 

But having said that I mean that 's it you know

I mean it 's a good old trudge to the tubes 

Far 

As I said before it 's about the same distance from Belsize Park but uhm Hillfield Road is actually slightly closer or at least Sherlock Road is slightly closer  than Hillfield Road  from West Hampstead

So 

Mm

I don't know why it seems closer 

Don't know why you say that 

Well I think it 's partly because you 're walking through a shopping centre 

Yeah 

And walking along sort of trudgey  residential roads is a long way 

There must be bu buses going along Mansfield Road

I 'll just say C eleven and the C twelve 

Mm 

Mm 

Yes it do does actually on

one of the problems is that the uhm

it does actually face  south-west not west 

So the garden is facing north-east

Yeah 

The garden is north-east so  

Pity it 's not the other side of the road 

I think it 's probably academic

Mm yes I can't see it now

C eleven

The front faces south-west uhm

Mm

Yes I can't see it 

It really does have to be uhm  two twenty 

Mm

Well

Two thirty maybe

You know 

Mm 

Well if he 's gone against the agent 's advice already  and slapped another fifty  on top he 's hardly likely to suddenly come right down again

I 've broken off two by mistake

I 'll try and break break them

Oh

I 've succeeded

Mm

Who is the he incidentally

I don't know

I was wondering that 

Some interfering son-in-law

Yes

Probably is 

Don't you get the feeling that she 's living there in that house  and the rest of it 's sort of derelict or totally deserted

and just that ground floor

Looks as if it might well have been doesn't it

And presumably for some time it 's been like that

Mm

Very spooky

Mm 

I bet there 's a lot of places around like that

Mm 

Yeah

I suppose so 

But they said that it was too much for her

The house was too much for her 

Mm

But I mean  she 's only living at the bottom of the hall

But the fridge was completely emptied out

Mm

She 's not living there now

She 's not

No

I I mean she 's obviously going in there from time to time cos there is a letter addressed to her here in Palmers Green

Ah

Cos the bed was made up

Oh that 's right

It said she 'd moved there

Oh yes

So I suppose that means that they could one could  take it over pretty quickly

Mm

Oh yeah 

Yeah 

At the same time it probably means that they 're not in a hurry to sell  necessarily  if they 've already moved 

Well well

We 'll see 

That woman from the Prince 's Trust incidentally

I 'd much rather buy from them than I would from bloody Benham and bloody boring Reid

Oh yes

That 's perfectly true 

Sorry what

Uhm the uhm that woman from the Prince 's Trust  from her description of where she lives she sounds as if she 's one of the people who lives at the back of Quintin-Kynaston who complains 

Mm

Ha ha

Cos I mean if you 're going to be on the borders of Swiss Cottage and St John 's Wood that 's where you are isn't it 

Well she said Swiss Cottage which means she must be some if she really means that then she 's some way away from it 

No

I think she would have said if she was that close to it

She would have said oh God I wouldn't send my son there

We 're far too close to it

I know what they get up to 

Mhm 

It is funny that the all the houses that have come up have been in Lisburne Shirlock Estelle Road

Nothing in Roderick Road nothing in Courthope

Oh yes there was one in Cressy Road

Nothing in Rona Road which is very short 

Nothing in  the road that 's too short for its name

M A C small N full stop

Wha Which one is that 

Mac

Macken

Not Mackenzie

I don't know 

One in Cressy

But what is the first one there

It is Crecy Road

It 's Cressy Road Macken-whatever Road Lisburne Roderick Shirlock Courthope Estelle Mona

Rona

Mona

Rona 

Oh Crecy 's the first one is it

Let 's take a look at the Mackies

No there 's no Macs at all 

Rona

It 's actually rather a nice one that

It 's sort of got a curve in it

They must have been his daughters mustn't they Rona and uh

What

And Estelle

And Estelle

Ha ha 

Builders always give

And his son was Roderick

I would think almost certainly

And maybe he had a son called Shirlock

Ha ha

It 's quite possible

Shirl for short

What I meant was to uh get today some  uhm abstract or  brief summary of the uh part that we would contribute Jan Aarts and I to your uhm your project with L S E

Yes 

Now I 've just been working on this and and the problem has been to a certain extent the printer

That also contains typos so

Which printer is this

Uh this is the I B M Pro

yes the I B M Proprinter

That was what it produced first of all  yeah uh and it was instructed to produce uh the text from  uh the file I had just created under Wordperfect

Really

Really

I 've not heard that we 're having any trouble with it

Did you ask anybody there

Uhm Gerry

Uh what did he say

Well  uh he in fact set it up because I don't know how the printing system works here

And uh he said it was temperamental 

Yeah

Uh very temperamental

I don't know what all this is about

Yes indeed

It 's uh 

Uh and how do you uh cope with the temperamentality

So we switched on and off uh several times uhm which is uh the best way of coping with temperamental printers 

Yeah 

So phase one is the corpus of a thousand wo a hundred thousand words 

Ah you 've uh upped the number

it 's thirty-five thousand

or was it twenty-five thousand

Yes that 's right yes

Twenty-five

That was a mistake by a factor of ten

How did you manage to make the mistake

Well I uhm in fact multiplied uh ten to the two by ten to the two and got ten to the uh four but forgot that I had uh created twenty-five  so

Why that particular  combination

Well because  we had uh five hundred pages and five hundred words per page what I was thinking of initially

and that would of course give uh two point five times ten to the three and not as I had worked out two point five times ten to the four 

Yes 

When you say phase two will have a corpus of a quarter of a million words  is that in addition to the hundred thousand

Oh yes yes so that really

It 's quite a large job of uhm  of uh  key-punching uh or there wouldn't be much in the way of key-punching

I suppose it would be optical scanning would it

No that that

Uh uh

Uhm yes I wouldn't

Would it be typed documents or

Uh the vast majority would be uh typed

indeed uh most of the documents would be in a machine readable form

No not not in the sense of in fact they 're scannable but but on but but on but onto disks

We would certainly ask for those to reduce the time

Machine readable form

No

So we would uh wh what our job would be would be

Presumably the first job would be to mark them up

That 's right yes

Which takes some time and of course proofread presumably 

Uhm what would the 

Uh this would be for  uhm proofreading for typos and that type kind of thing

Yeah

Yes

But uh uh actually the various spelling checkers and grammar checkers are not too bad for  the discovery of uh typos

If one 's gone through those those uh procedures then it wouldn't take very long I think to uh clean up the rest 

And there 'd be

I don't

Sorry

For the first first phase there wouldn't be very much to do with that type cos these are teaching materials that have been well sort of edited and I would have uhm

We can get those in a machine readable form so there 's no problem at all with that in the first stage

One of the consortium members uh  uh has all the files

in fact it 's their teaching material that we 're using 

So  th th th there would be no no

there would be no problem at all uh

What 's a text grammar

Are you using it in the technical sense of the text grammar

That 's a discourse grammar

Yes

Ye ye yes well I 'm u using it in the sense that one is not looking at uhm in fact sentences

One is looking at the con the uh the uh where you connect sentences

One is looking at paragraph uh structure and the ordering of a sequence of uh sentences

I think this is not going to be done in the short time that you 're talking about

I mean that 's a big task on its own  uh and I 'm not sure how far one would go from the uh tagging and parsing uh to this uh text grammar

You I thought when you were talking about formal grammar you were talking about a grammar at the sentence level

A grammar at the uh uh paragraph text level is is  something that you would not get uh simply by looking at the parser

But

well

No no this is where the I talk about a

Of course you have other difficult structures than those two

Uhm yes and also the rule-based uh knowledge system that one assumes and and that 's part of the uh part of the uh study

The L S E would be doing that principally and you need I argue an a rule-based knowledge system before you can articulate what a text grammar should be

And I think that a sentence grammar holds up as a purely linguistic entity

but anything more than that I think you 'd need very much  uh  more uh extra linguistic ina information

and the sort of information you need is a rule-based knowledge system for  in this case project management

But that rule-based system is what L S E is providing

That 's L S E

Uh L S E will be working on that

In fact Akiva if uh time permits may also do some work on that as he is interested in doing that for his P H D uh and it would be very useful for the project if he did that

But basically this is the uh uh in my view the goal which we should be moving towards

Now it may well be the case that the timescales I have in mind are not in fact realistic and that we need to get the sentence grammar reasonably correct first of all cos that 's

It depends what you mean by text grammar

I 'm still not sure

I mean have you got an example in mind of a text grammar

Do you have a model of a text grammar that already exists

Well

Uh  uh  no

There 's no there 's nothing that I 've seen

There are bits and pieces towards text grammars in uhm Computational uhm Linguistics predominantly where people are trying to look trying to look at texts

Uh in the uhm  I think October issue of Computational uh Linguistics there 's an attempt to do something of this type

Oh

I 've not seen those

And this is what in what form does this

What form does this take

Uhm it 's a  set of uh uh uh indications of the way in which one can use uh connectives for example between sentences the way you can structure paragraphs to obtain a certain objective

Not in the sense of uh in the form of formulae

No but uh uh uh

I 'd like to see this uh

I mean the fact is that there has never been a text grammar

I mean there 've been various uh programmatic statements but I 've never seen a text grammar

Well until you have the rules-based knowledge representation system uh I 'd maintain you can not possibly have a text grammar

That 's a necessary condition

But equally

So how why are you uh uh asking us to do a text grammar before uh a knowledge grammar

Well I 'm assuming that the sequence would be uh to develop the sentence grammar the way that it has been done for

Then the rule-based system would be developed uh at the same time as that

Uh then what I had in mind was that at the end of the sentence grammar which is a necessary condition of the text grammar of course one would then be able to uh take up the knowledge system that had been developed and uhm create uhm a uh text grammar or protocols for a text grammar based on that particular knowledge system

I don't think that Jan Aarts

I 'm not uh uh uh I 'm sure about myself

I don't know what Jan Aarts would think uh would be able to commit ourselves to producing a text grammar uh uh within any foreseeable time limit that you 're likely to propose

Uh even the production of a sentence grammar you know limited to a particular domain would be quite a formidable task it seems to me

Could I

Yes I think that 's

Well I think one of the differences may be that uhm you and Jan Aarts will do things to the highest standards of course

Uhm I tend to be pragmatic in all things  and try to get uh results

And what I would do would not be of course at the same level in any sense at all

but would it be possible to consider uh li uh limiting the S E U and the Nijmegen contribution to the sentence grammar then I would do the text grammar part

Probably I couldn't do it very well

but it would be better than having no text grammar at all uh because we need in my view to have a functional specification of a text grammar so we can start to process in this case project uhm management texts through some software to make it more efficient

but uh if I have uh some idea of what sentence grammar would be like then I can make a better stab at getting out a text grammar

Well uh that 's again a problem uhm

To start with what would be a sentence grammar

I mean what sort of sentence grammar do you envisage

Well it would we we which it would be one

What sort of model are you thinking of

Well I I 'm thinking basically of a subset of the Comprehensive Grammar that sort of statement on what sort of uh syntactical uh structures are in fact uh permissible within that uh domain and which ones are uh frequently used which ones create cognitive processing problems which ones are easily processed

Ah that 's a different thing

That 's a that 's got nothing to do with the grammar

Well

what

Uh I mean there are two separate things I mean uh several uh uh separate points you 've been making 

Uh one is uh  a grammar of what is possible

Now you see most things in English are possible 

Uh  some things are simply not as likely as others so uh I suppose frequency would give some indication in a corpus of that sort of probability of occurrence

Uh that could be done for the items that would be uhm covered by the tagger and the parser obviously not as uhm delicate an analysis as will be used on the ICE  system because uh we are doing a lot of manual intervention  uh but the question of efficiency is quite a different one

Oh sure

Uh ee that is something which uh wh which in fact I would do basically that I would take the information from the studies of the uh parsed corpus to suggest possible treatments to give to texts and I would measure the efficiency of those treatments basically 

And so I would in that sense be engaged in uh contributing to the efficiency element of the grammar

And I think that is very important uh for practical purposes and the sentence grammar that the S E U would do as I as I see it would be using the sort of classification insights and the interpretation and the general feeling for language which is the major contribution as I see it of the Survey to a uh to a sublanguage basically that language used in project project uh management

And one would be looking to the S E U to use all of that you know experience looking at a looking at a parsed corpus and saying in this case what the sentence grammar what the as it were the descriptive sentence grammar was and I would come in with the efficiency aspect of the different constructions and I would contribute to it

Well I wouldn't contribute to the grammar in the sense that you mention but I would contribute to this uhm new to to this idea of a grammar of efficient  text

Was it good

Yeah

S set in working class Dublin 

Unknown cast 

There 's a guy who lives with his family and  his father 's into Elvis  and this

Mm

Yeah

Mm mm

So what sort o what sort of music do they play

Sixties soul 

Uh Otis Redding stuff

He wants to get a band together 

so he asks all these well asks around advertises in the paper and gets all these weirdos coming to the door  like punks and heavy metal

and 

Trying to get a band together

There 's about  three girl singers 

There 's a soloist and drummer

And they all get together but they all have fights and 

It 's a very good film though

Music 's really good 

Mm

Uh uhm

Yeah

Uh that was yesterday afternoon 

Have you seen uh Boyz N The Hood 

You ought to go and see that actually

Is that good

Yes

Is it all rap music

Not really

I mean it 's it 's about uhm  sort of ghetto life in uh Los Angeles 

That 's uhm that 's quite kind of a hard  film

It 's got

It 's good actually

It 's worth seeing

Uhm

Oh yes

And what i wh what 's expensive

It was seven pounds 

That 's ridiculous

The Ritzy in Brixton is four pounds

And at Whiteleys if you go before five o'clock it 's three pounds

Yeah well

Miaow

You can't get lower than that

Uhm  also went to see 

In the West End they s they usually do about four pounds if you go before five o'clock or something

Like the Empire

Uh uhm

It 's supposed to be uh rubbish

You 're joking

It 's had good reviews

Well you know most people that went 

I think it looks brilliant

I really like Billy Crystal and Bru Bruno Kerby as well

He 's good

Well I only know one person who went to see it and he said it was rubbish 

Well you only know one person

And I 'm I 'm looking forward to seeing it

I like Bru

Bruno Kerby was in Good Morning Vietnam

Was he

Have you seen that

No 

Yes I have

Yes it was all right

He played the chap who didn't want him there 

Oh right 

Uhm so what did you in your

Did you do some ecology  today

I did my conservation bit today in a place called Sheepleas  which is

Sheepleas 

How do you spell that

S H double E P

L E A S

Uhm

Which is  it 's north

Sort of near Leatherhead

No

It 's West Horsley

Uh uhm

It 's chopping down birch trees

But they 're quite thick so

Mm

Why do you need to chop them down 

They just stop the light getting through 

They stop the light getting through

Mm

Through to what

Oh yeah

It 's a bi it 's a horrible tree

What

Birch trees

We just g we just get rid of them

And the hazel 's useful for hurdling

But we were having a bonfire 

So  d d nobody likes birch trees

And we were also mak making a footpath through 

We had a lot of public through

We have a money tin as well

But they grow 

Mm

So who uhm  who finds all these places for you to 



Well we all have our regular sites which some of the founder members of the group did and then  I found  couple and Alice has found some because she 's she organises the task  where other people live

Uhm

Right

So are they nice people in the group

Mm very nice

We 're having a bonfire party on Tuesday night

Some nice boys

There could be one or two nice boys

Good 

Are you what you 're hav you 're having one on Tuesday

Where 

At uhm one of the girls '

Well she 's not a girl

she 's about forty-two or something 

She 's a girl to some

Literally

Uhm sh she 's got quite a small house a small garden a small

Uhm whereabouts

Whereabouts

Sh she 's got a small garden  the fire the bonfire and

Actually it 's not a small garden

No it 's not small it 's quite big 

a small house though

It 's big but it 's small

N nice nice size garden that she really looks after

And she 's got loads of rabbits and guinea pigs 

So we might toast them as well 

Yes

I 'm sure they 'll be tasty

We 're all bringing we 're all bringing either fireworks or sparklers which I 've got and  beefburgers and

Cos we 'll get the barbecue going as well and toast marshmallows in the bonfire

Mm

Good lo good lo good lot on barbecues is those uhm  vegetable grills you get at uh supermarkets

Danepack vegetable grills with  crispy crumb outer coating

How many do you get in a pack

Six

It 's about it 's about one pound fifty or something

Uhm that 's an idea

Ve very tasty

Made with real vegetables  and rice and stuff 

Vegetable grills

Well someone 's bringing a rice dish 

Yeah might get  could I suppose get one packet  or couple of packets and just one mega-packet of beefburgers decent ones

I 'll go to Marks

Do Marks do vegetable grill

Should do shouldn't they

Uhm

Their own sort I would imagine

I 'll have a look and see what they 've got 

But uhm

So what did you do today then

Today 

I went I watched the grand prix 

And then uh do you remember  a neighbour in Hillside  called uh the Pembertons

Mm

Uh uhm

Yes

Pembertons

Well I know uh

I met him actually about a year ago with uhm 

Uh I 've only seen seen him perhaps mon month or something and I went

Yeah Oliver

Oliver Pemb Pemberton

I used to go to s

I went to school with Emma



Didn't I go to school with their daughter

Is there is there was there a girl there

What at Mr Parsons ' 

You went to Mrs Parsons ' didn't you 

N

Did I have

Was there a sister there

Well uh he 's got a 

I don't know whether

Yeah I suppose so but I heard that

Emma



Josephine

Josephine I don't know 

Uhm but as she she 's got  he 's got somebody living in his house who 's who used to go to Mrs Parsons '

So how did you meet up with him then 

Oh he was a member of the bicycle polo club last year

Oh right

And 

What kind of bicycles do you ride on then 

Bicycles with two wheels handlebars and a frame 

They have they don't have any brakes  uhm but they are  connected to the rear wheels

Uh  they 're fixed wheel they don't have they don't you can't freewheel on them so you you brake by slowing down on the pedals 

Yes I mean just because they 're supposed to be bikes 

Uhm

Oh right

And you just have a little stick and a

It 's sort of

 You have a you have a a mallet and you have a  a ball 

Uhm

Not a tennis ball just kind of hard ball

No it 's a a sort of hollowish plastic  ball  quite hard 

And uh the bikes are short got a sh very the wheels are very close together so you can turn quickly

So where d' you play this

Uhm in Putney  Hurlingham Park 

Oh that 's next to the Hurlingham Club itself is it

It 's next to the uh Hurlingham Club yes 

Oh right

So whe how often do you play

I play uhm  once a week in the in the summer 

But it 's now winter so we don't play any more because it gets dark too early

Well Mummy and I will have to come and watch you won't we  and play s

 Such fun 

 Such fun 

Uhm 

Yes but what we have what were we

Oh yes you saw Oliver Pemberton

What did you do yesterday

Uhm  I went and watched the rugby

Oh right twelve six wasn't it 

I was watching a bit of it in Kensington High Street when Blinkers had it on

Yeah

Uhm and then uhm went out to the theatre

Right at the Royal Court yes

And uh 

No I I want to go and see the Alan Ayckbourn play

What were you going to ask whe with with whom wh were you going to ask 

The Alan Ayckbourn one runs over two nights 

Over two nights



Is it over two nights

Uhm 

Oh I didn't know that

But you you don't you don't have to have to book up the same the following night

You can book it up a week later or something

You know you can book for one week and then

But it 's it 's more cost effective to actually book both nights at the same time

Well I mean you can do one one night and one a week later 

But it 's worth booking both at the same time so that cos it costs less I think

But I shall

Yeah

I didn't know it was a huge  thing 

It 's got Griff Rhys-Jones and Joanna Lumley 

Because Karen and I have been to see most of his plays

Uhm

Uhm

Have you

Uhm Invisible Frames is good

Henceforward

And there 's one at

Italian Karen 

Karen Kappan

Uh uhm 

And what 's she doing these days

Where 's she working

For an interior design c well not design uhm  furnish companies 

Where

They 're in uhm  an industrial estate quite a smart one in East Molesley

Wha what are they called

Allied International

Her father works in the same  just down the road from her so they often meet for lunch

So they actually make furni furnishings do they or do they actually d just design

Well just furnish companies I suppose I think Allied International

She does everything there

She 's got a share in the company and

It 's a very small company

She does everything

 

Neil 's in a  in a posh place now 

Her father 's paying forking out a lot of money a week 

He can afford to pay

He 's rich

Hopefully it will improve Neil a bit but I think he 's happier where he is now

Has he got can he speak

Yeah I mean he 's a pretty normal boy

He 's schizophrenic 

Poor chap

He 's twenty-five now so he 's had it for sin since he was sixteen  and he 's just happier now where he is

And mother 's over at the moment

I 'm seeing her on Saturday  during the day

During the day

And Alice as well 

I 've got to get uhm Clare Greeton 's birthday present

Do you know have you met Clare

Clare Greeton

The B B C 

Yeah

B B C class

Porsche

Porsche

Uhm ex-Porsche

She sold that ages ago I think

What has she got now

Nothing

Her boyfriend 's got a car so

The boyfriend

Mhm

They are moving out to Portugal next year end of next year 

The coast

They are going to uhm they 've bought a house

Well he has  and they 're going to run a bookshop and supermarket 

So if people want to read a book on holiday  they would buy it for about

They they they if they become hungry they eat the book  and read the uh  and read the instructions on  the baked beans tins

They buy the books say for a couple of pounds  and then return it and get half and get one pound back or something like that

That 's how they do it

Right

So she 's got about four thousand books now I think  or three thousand

She 's been collecting  second hand books

Yeah all from jumble sales 

Mm

Alice and I have given quite a few 

She could have had all Dad all Daddy 's books

Yeah I was just about to say that 

So when Alice and I go round we always you know borrow a book for it 's uh like our own library really 

I 'm seeing her on the  in about three week 's time

It 's her birthday so I 've got to try and find think about what to get her

She 's got everything really

Now I think that this would be a really ace idea if  as a bold initial strategy we decided what on earth the notes were 

uhm now Guy 's doing the 

I 've also made all the notes that I was going to on one of these sheets of paper

Have I actually succeeded in leaving it at home 

I bet I have 

Mhm

 you 've marked it have you

Eh

Have you made some notes

Sorry

I actually

I actually made a note on eight periods

Here we are

I 've I 've actually got it

Right

Now what 's going to happen here is uhm  it 's  five parts

four parts of a solo which Guy is doing cos it 's easier to stick on later

uhm and  so we 're accompanying him 

And  uhm  wherever you 've got some other kind of situation as for instance in the last  uh say three to four bars

Yeah 

uhm whenever that happens uhm assuming that Guy is going to do the middle part which is mostly uhm that 's the bottom tenth

It 's the bottom tenth 

So that so  I might stick in some other things at an early  stage because it because it might help  uhm so that you know sort of what the tune is as it were

so you can have some idea of how the chords are going

uhm but basically that 's that 's what we 'll do

So  uhm

Yeah right

Mhm

Mhm

Have you decided what to do with exercise number six

When did you do that

How many times did you do that

A couple of times

uhm the only time I think the only time was at the bottom of what 's called a hundred and thirty

Yes

Now that 's just marked sing whichever you can

uhm

I don't

Do you think that 's what that bracket is

Mhm 

No brackets usually indicate whether it 's tenor or bass

Well it 's five isn't it

Well it 's one pass

it 's one pass isn't it

And it 's splitting

Yes 

I suppose so if we have to

If we have to

Yes

uhm is there is one of the is one of the parts 

I think ideally the one that I 'd like missed out is uhm  is the fifth  

Yeah

So you you go down to the bottom Timmy for C

The B

Yeah  and I 'll go up 

yes

Yes

Yeah

uhm and does that mak is that a musical nonsense uhm  Roger

No

I don't think so

Let 's let 's try let 's try it like that initially because the point is the fifth is in the in the solo part anyway

so

On the first bar you got to decide what you 're doing in the first bar of that line 

Presumably they start in E flat

uhm

uh  well it 's it 's

Sorry A flat

It 's OK 

Well  we miss out  we miss out we should miss out the notes that are in the solo

Exactly

That 's right

Aren't they

So what does that mean

The person that 's affected is me basically isn't it

So what would I sing if I if we 're  filling holes in that chord 

You would go

Wa what is down there

No you 're the top line

I 'm the second ti I 'm second line down

uh from the solo you mean or

Can we take it can we take it from from there

Sorry about this Roger

Sorry about this

I should 've 

It 's all right 

Very very very slow 

What what about that

Could you just play the notes that I 'm going to be doing   

Yeah I agree

We missed the part at the top of part A 

Sorry

Again 

Right

Right

OK got it 

Sorry about this

It 's all right

You 're doing that wrong

Right

Try again 

So you go 

Yeah

OK

Right 

Yeah

Yes

Right

OK

I 'm all right then 

Right

OK

What are we going to give ourselves to start this song

It 's a sort of a peculiar chord isn't it

Yeah

It is 

Yes 

That 's not too close now 

All right

Well yeah

OK 

You pick it up and begin to sing on the chord

Right

OK

Now

The first

The first



Yeh

That 's easy 

I can't sing any bottom E flat 

The first uhm  the first three lines are pretty easy really 

uhm and it 's not quite as bad as it looks

But it it says

It 's the same sort of speed for that

Doo doo doo doo

OK 

A separate doo on each one

uhm I think s I think so actually

I think so

All right

All right

So it 's 

OK

What does it do when it goes into a different time on the second page 

uhm  we 've all got words

The 

Sorry

Yes

Well ultimately ultimately I think it 's going to be something like uhm pm pm pm pm pampam pam pam pam pam

Sort of  that kind of thing

OK

Let 's  

I 'll give you one  two  three  four 

OK 

Hold it there

Thank you

Now then any problems you 've had so far

A few cock ups on my part

It 's ooo not doo the second time is it

No

It 's it it 'll it 'll be doos all the way through

Doos all the way through 

I reckon 

Anybody have any any problems at all 

uhm 

uh 

I 'd just like to do that again uhm basically for my s for my sake

but I 'd try have a I 'd try have a   better listen 

Two three four 

OK

Right

O K

That sounded that sounds very very nice

That sounds very very nice

And nobody 's got any problems noteswise at all

sounds like

And so Roger we 're doing a we 're doing a we 're putting a a D on the front of each of these notes because I think it needs it really cos it 's a sort of

It 's that kind of that kind of feel 

Right

Now 

uhm in this bit here this bit here I told you what kind of speed the thing will eventually go

but I don't think we 're going to rehearse it at that speed for the moment

I 'm going to rehearse it very very slowly 

I 'd like to do it at that kind of speed for the moment

uhm there are  all kinds of  typical  

They 're there 're there 're all kinds of bits where  somebody 's got the words for the others

I mean like you 've got them to start Tim

and we haven't

So we 're like accompanying there

And then Roger 's got a little bit and Gavin 's got a bit  further on a and so on

Because the watch out for them

Don't be surprised when they happen

and uh if we 're actually singing something at the time then we want to kind of uh  be aware of three-or-four-words

OK 

So 

Let 's take it from 

OK 

So what would that be

What 's is it in four 



One  from quite

One two three four 

It 's you Gavin

Oh yeah all right

I was waiting

I don't know what I was waiting for

Same same same again

Yeah

Two three four

Can we take it just from just there 

Let 's take it take it s straight straight in on that  and straight on sort of third third stave on the one I 'm coming to 

Still pretty slow

One

One two three four 

Try try it again

Sorry  

One two three four 

Right

Now on that uhm  there will be a pause

There will be a there will be quite a pause on that on that sheep

Two three

There

What 's that

Where 's that

Sorry

Do you want us to continue the note as well

Have we got to that stage

Uh  for the moment yes because it 's a nice chord

uhm but I 'll  maybe we can establish it and go away from it 

But uh we 'll see about that

OK 

Anybody got any problems noteswise on that 

You you all right Gavin

Yeah

Yeah

More or less

Good

OK

uhm  well in that case let 's take it from exactly the same place at where do they keep the little black sheep

And this time we 'll go straight on

And then it 's back to the uh uhm  last part of O one three one

OK

Let 's take it

Thank you

OK 

Two three four 

OK that this last line didn't sound quite right

uhm  

Shall we try and take it just for the second time from the second tone bar

uhm

So we 're singing 

Sorry

It 's my fault as much as anybody else 's more than anybody else 's

Right

uhm let 's take it from there

Still the same slow speed

From the second tone bar

Yes please 

One two three four 

My fault again

uhm  could you just play it through so we know what it 's exact exactly cos I 'm not confident that I know what that it 's supposed to sound like

It 's pretty

It 's nice

A good chord actually 

 

How does that sound to you

It sounds great 

 

Right 

Great

Great stuff

Great stuff

Same same again just really for my benefit

uhm 

Same place

Second tone bar 

One and two 

Second tone bar

Sorry

Absolutely

Oh what

All right

Yeah 

Two three four 

It 'll sound even better when you got Guy in there as well

Yes

It 's odd without the other extra man

That 's uh

Right

OK

Now then next thing I want to do is take the fast section something close to the speed that we 're actually going to take it 

No

This is a little lie

The next thing I have to do is have a drink of beer

And that 's what we 're going to do 

uhm right 

Right



Now I 'm quite happy 

Now

uhm the other thing is is Gavin  you 're you 're not quite right on the on the timing on this  uhm your your little solo  I reckon

Yeah mhm

Well it 's in  six eight isn't it



Yeah

Eh

That 's what it is

Oh

True

Yes

You 're right

Well you 've done it

You sing it you sing it you sing it Roger 

Go on

You take it

And then a second wait on the pause on there

Yeah

Yes

You sing it Roger

Go on 

No you you 're singing exactly right

That 's exactly it

And then it goes back into four but it 's in six eight for those two bars

Right

I suppose it 's supposed to be free tempo isn't it

Sounds sounds funny to me

I don't know

It 's got be it 's got to sound as though it fits in somehow hasn't it

I suppose they put it in six-eight just to give you the idea that it 's supposed to be sort of fairly free  unless it 's supposed to be a take-off or something

uhm well it is

It is in a way

All you got to do is  it at the same time basically 



Is it is that about is that about right

Do that again sorry



Well no because you 're still doing it in four four time

and it isn't

I mean that 's not what 's there

I mean you might want to do it like that but that isn't what they 've written

Am I

So have you managed to uhm land any more big uhm orders or something permanent

No

It 's very very very quiet at the moment

I mean at somewhere like G C H Q then it would be worth it

but 

Do they have canteens 

Yes they do

Business is coming off but uhm 

Oh yes

Because the lady opposite used to work in the canteen

Did she 

Mm

Mm

This is going to be a question of who you know not what you know

 

That 's right

So if you can work on that one

 from her it 's the end of information technology if you change things

I knew I know the phone number of the chap uhm



Yeah

But what I need is a personal intro to him

Yeah well I I 'll phone him up and work on him

Yes  you can't

Put in a good word because that that would be uhm ideal

That 'd be too fantastic

But you realise that everything every leaf will have had to be vetted   that there 's no microfilm  wrapped around roots and everything

Yes

Well only one charge for it

Yeah 

Absolutely  uh uh did you disturb this broccoli

Mm

Uhm this park idea idea 's fascinating

I wonder who supplies them at the moment because uh uh certainly none of the locals do  

But we 're talking we 're talking about  canteens needing well I 've really no idea two or three

Well I must just push

Remember there 's a twenty-four hour service there

That place never closes

So their canteens are all  go all the time

Mm  yes

Actually I 'll tell you who does uh open in fact

It could well be 

But I can't remember if he still does

He did do them Keith Fountain  lower in the high street

Had a contract for fennel 

Uh

Mm

So he he has a bit

 has grown

Yeah

But he may he may have uhm  this one as well well

Oakley

Oakley as well

Mm

And if he 's got it there 's no way I 'm going after it 

We do not do that amongst greengrocers and chandlers

We leave each other 's patches alone very firmly

Sounds like the masons really doesn't it 

Does a bit mhm

Very closed shop

That 's it

I i if they come to us and say we want to leave because we 're unhappy then we 'd take them on

And and that applies to all of us

but we none of us poach each other 's business

That that is an unwritten law and anyone who does  very rapidly  very rapidly 

Get black-legged

Yeah 

No

They don't just get blacklegged

we can put them out of business really 

I mean it is the most incredible sort of Mafia thing that happens

And i I mean it 's just like  uhm you know our own little  magic circle or whatever it is because there 's absolutely nothing said

We don't have meetings or anything

But as long as you play ball you 're totally included in  or whatever

or want  for something they 'll give it to you

and you get generously

And if you want to borrow something from somebody you pay costs

you never pay a penny over the odds for what it cost them 

Uhm and help

I mean you ring up 

Got really good Christmas trees this year

It 'd be worth us all getting in on it

But the moment you cross the lines  the shutters go up 

your business gets nicked 

I nearly added that it 's a ruthless sort of carve-up 

Now that 's business for you

We 've done it to three people I think so far

Mm

One of them we found nicking on the market

Three people here have less

There was one of them nicking on the market

Chapman Chapman 

Wh what 's your name

The Kray brothers

No

We didn't do anything that anybody could ever prove that it was 

Not sure whether G C H Q is all that different 

You may have a little trouble getting in

I wonder why they don't use the label

But I think they do

I think he fancies it a bit

Yes Terry

Terry is nearer than you are isn't he down the  hill

I don't think Terry 'd want it 

Don't think it 's Te quite Terry 's scene

Oh well I 'll talk to Terry

Tell him he needs it  

As at the moment it is such a nightmare

Oh come on

They 've just bought that great big huge guest house  in Gloucester

I know

I know

They don't need any more business 

I mean it sounds

running the greengrocer business 

You see what what galls Alan is the fact that Terry is a greengrocer

Ray knew me you see and I used to go to Terry and Mary for years  

Mhm

Mhm 

Sounds reasonable 

Well they were nearer

That 's why

Exactly

You used to come to me once in a while just to keep  to show your face

That was all 

No

To be fair you used to come when your Mum and Dad were still living in Portland Road but you haven't been since 

No no no

That 's  it

But who on earth would be seen in a Kitchen Garden Shop

I mean I ask you

You don't even call it the right by its right name

Kitchen Garden Shop

No

It 's just The Kitchen Garden

And you never yet said it right  

You always say it every way but the right way

He does it deliberately I might say

Mm

The Kitchen Shop  

It is not The Kitchen Shop 

Well The Garden Shop

Yes

That 's better

The Weed Shop

Yes

Well that 's about right

Grass shop is what it is

Mm

Is that what it is

Though I tried to think up when I 've when I 've cleared the garden paths 

I was trying to make up something 

Yes

Well

you see

he came home the other day

and he was telling me  that down on the market early in the morning

and if it 's suddenly the market 's going on a bit longer and they go and have a teabreak  d' you know what paper they look at these men

No

The Sun



The Sport 

The Sport

The Daily Sport

So he was telling me you know what was in it

So I said well bring them home

Let me have a look 

You know just for the sheer  you know of it



Well honestly  

He did bring it

Oh he did

He brought three copies not one

I brought three copies

I only had a quick look in one 

But honest to goodness there 's all these numbers that you can dial for all  all the different sexual pleasures that you want 

You can send off for all these different  things

Mm

They 're just  

Oh yes

Are they are they classified the sexual pleasures 

I don't know

I mean it it really is

I mean did you look at the crossword

Did did you look at the cross did you look at the crossword 

I 'm no 

Yes 

God I mean I mean can you can you quote a clue out of the crossword

No I can't because I 'm bursting to spend a penny

Go and spend a penny

Yeah  yeah yeah

But I mean you know uh

D' you know Alan can tell us a clue 

Well yes

I mean there was there was one honest 

Oh yes

I do yeah

Well it 's it 's it 's just so base and and everything

But it was uhm  the clue roughly was uh masturbate 'n' wanker  uhm  the answer was a six letter word which meant male  male abuse

Yeah anyway

I mean

that 's the sort of level that it 's all right

It 's a total take-off

The whole thing is a take-off

And I mean as long as it 's looked at in the right mood  it can be amusing to look at once

It was so funny

And then he would say back to the girl

And he said well obviously this girl it 's gotta be silicon chips

You know because she was sort of clean 

Oh yeah

I mean

that was 

you can be sure

But I mean that that 's you get lots of men together who 're all basically a basic a basic corny lot they tend to look at basic corny things 

And they  basic corny ideas as well



Most of us have minds like gutters anyway

Yes

 they 're greengrocers aren't they

Why have you got to have a dirty mind to be a greengrocer

When you are dealing with cabbages and lettuces why have you got to have a dirty mind

Melons

and 

Yeah

I 'm know  

Why have you got to have a dirty mind dealing with plums greengages cabbages broccoli and 

I don't know that 

Surprising really what you  your customer 'll do 

  

You come out of it a better way than I do 

Yes

You have to get to know them quite well first 

Well Will will tell me where that sort of shop is

Oh yes

I mean things 

He 's absolutely charming Will

He 's lovely

But I don't think

He 's gay you see

We 'd find out he 's gay 



He really is gay

And there 's this  this lady that comes in 

Apparently one day she made a grab for Will 's uh manhood 

So every time she comes in now Will dives for the back of the shop 

So Alan stands there waiting  

Mm 

 you 've got a you 've got a vivid bigger imagination than I have 

You do

I know you do

You have







You 've come home

You haven't met Barbara Williams

Or you wouldn't say things like that

Mmm

No

Don't you see

I know when you come home 

She is over seventy

She is this size

She weighs ten

It doesn't matter

Never mind the size feel the width or length or whatever

Length

It 's difficult to tell where the legs begin and the shoulders end   and the neck begins

There was a saying never find the 

never mind the  quality

feel the width 

Just a saying

No

Or something

I 've never heard of that one

Yes

Yes

That 's right

Uhm 

Never mind the

Never mind the quality feel the width

Oh really

Go to the loo before you wet yourself  

No

I don't want to go now

No

It 's gone off hasn't it

Yes 

Uh yes

Because I 've been doing mind over matter you see

Mark I was telling Rachel  the deaconess introduced you to Jean

I am right in that aren't I

I think so

Yes



Well it don't I I I I 'm almost certain I did

Well your memory 's perf better than mine is you know

B a at the ch at the church

You and you were you knew this church

and she was the deac

and Jean came and and

and I think that uh she

Mm

She actually introduced us

I think so

Yes

Yes that 's right

She didn't she didn't say keep away from this man

but she said

This is Mark

Pity

Yeah 

Whatever

So that was the first you heard of Mark 

That was the first I 'd heard of him yes

I remembered m I remember Mark coming to  coming to Ivy Bridge 

his first visit ever to us 

and do you remember my little house there and rooms I had

We all sat round

and you you got intrigued by the little rooms

and you wrote me a letter about my little rooms in Ivy Bridge



Uh uhm

Did I

Oh dear

Doesn't sound very  

No No you did

that 's very complimentary very very good

When Louis was staying I stayed a week I think

Yes

You stayed there

It was really marvellous

Wonderful 

And then  that 's the first meeting with Mark 

I 've met him several times since Marjorie

Oh

Yeah 

Is it giving you pleasant memories or not

Yes yes yes

I was just thinking what dreadful things I say about  

And if I remember rightly you had jaundice didn't you

Trust him to stay longer

I had had

I was getting over it

Yes that 's right

I I It was that time

But you went back and you had jaundice or something

Uhm

Oh after that was it 

Y About then yes

Yes 

Uh uhm

I didn't know for sure whether it was the salmon I had for you or what other  were giving giving you jaundice or something 

Or had I had it before

I know I had it about then

No

You probably had it before

I was probably looking a bit yellow still

Yeah

I didn't know whether you were Chinese or what you were when you came but still

No no no no that 's that 's an exaggeration

I didn't mean that no

Uh I think you ha a got jaundice prior to that

And as I say we 're talking about years ago

I can remember them but I c well I can't remember my dates 

That 's right yes yes

No uh and have you got

You remember  very well

It 's an amazing memory

Yes 

Uhm 

Do you remember one day Mark  you were going back and uhm  I was taking you to Newton Abbot to catch a train 

And as we got down over the steps at stairs at Newton Abbot the train was just pulling out

You had to get back to London or you were I don't know something

you were teaching or doing something in London

Uhm

Uhm

Yes 

I know it was imperative you had to get back that morning that day

And uh we just missed the train

The train was just pulling out as we got there over the stairs 

So I said don't worry about this 

and we ran back to my car 

This seems unbel unbelievable but I did it

And we caught that train at Exeter 

Do you remember that

Uhm

Yes

Uhm

Uhm

For the rest of the journey

Yes

Sounds like a James Bond chase

We did

I did catch the train for you didn't I 

Oh yes

I remember that 

I remember your mother when she with the uh in Sloane Square 

Sh she was living in the some place in Sloane Street Sloane Square and she was with a firm of business consultants there 

And she  sh was home for the weekend or home for some reason 

And she had to be back on duty that day

But we left in the morning and I left with her very early

And she had to be in at a certain time and I had to stop and get petrol

And I got her to her office in Sloane Square with time to spare 

That was in London

Did this

And then you drove back again

Drove right back again and went on the  

Such energy 

Yes 

I remember the biggest thing I ever did as regards to driving 

When we had the shop in Ivy Bridge 

Remember them uh those  Mum and Dad

Mum

When Mum was alive and uh  she was very very ill

And he rang and said that she was very ill and poor Flo all got very upset and had to see her

I said right

And we used to close our shop at nine o'clock at night and I said to Flo right we 'll see your mother

And this is really really true

Cos she was very close so  is really true 

Flo she she packed some clothes

'n' closed our shop at nine o'clock in iv in Ivy Bridge in Fore Street

And they lived in Pembroke Dock three hundred and twenty-five miles away

Cos there was no Horse Ferry then up in place-name

It was too early in the morning

you see the  I had to go right around Chepstow and all that way down to get to Pembroke Dock

Now I got into Pembroke Dock

They lived adjacent to the dockyard there

There 's a big dockyard clock and that clock was striking exactly nine o'clock when when we got there

Amazing

And I did that drive  after being in my shop all day working

I wasn't on the road then

I was working in  shop

Uhm

Uhm

And that took a bit of diddin doing

That was my big one of my biggest achievements I think to do that sort of thing

Uhm

Yes

Drive there 

You must have been a very fast driver 

Well there was no tr there wasn't traffic on the road then

You s you saw the k k occasional car 

But I did it 

And I was uh  very very tired I know 

Yeah 

It 's all about me isn't it today

What am I talking about I 'm

There was I talking about 

Uhm

It 's your special day

All  all the family are here since you 're here

It 's your day anyway 

Yes

You 'll be thinking just how well he 's a clever dick or he thinks he is really 

It 's lovely to hear all these things 

Will you have another cup of tea grandpa

No thank you sweetheart

You 've got 

No I 've picked the sherry

All right

Why ha ha haven't you had a biscuit of some sort or something

Sorry I 'm a bit vague

Eating them before 

Those are very tempting those  are

Thank you

True

Ah I 've got a pla there was a plate here for me





I was going to say this hasn't been used here

Thank you very much

Sorry 

And now we 're s we 're sitting in a in a house on a piece of ground where you had kept ponies isn't it

That corner

Here

Yes yes

That is true Mark

That 's true 

Miss Mahan at at the Perchester Road there

and that 's now then that 's where the vicarage is going to be in the back of that 

The vicar 's left here now 

He 's just finished  his last serv service

three-or-four-words baptists

That 's good

He 's gone to Glastonbury 

Uh there 's no one been appointed here yet but it will be about two months I think

There 's a canon officiating here now am I right in saying that

I don't go to church

I know it 's Canon somebody

On this in this

Uhm

Uh uhm



Uh uhm

Well I know somebody 's coming here in the meantime

Yeah canon he is I think

And we 're going to shoot the canon and uh uhm 



The vicarage

The vicarage

Yeah

That 's right

Well  uhm  young Cochan the man that 's on he he 's he knows quite a bit about the church

He bought the place over here and he has sold what he bought to the  uhm local combine called the diocese dio dicey diocese

Uh uh well uh  parish church council

or it may be it may be the diocese it may be the diocese that owns it I don't kn that would buy it

I don't know



They bo well they bought it for three hundred and fifty thousand pounds

Uh uh

Where is where is this

Just in see the big house as you go out the house  that they 're working on  just stick your hand out again 

Uh that 's where it 's  but

but what I was saying is the house that they 're working on now they had two spinster ladies lived there called Miss Mahon

and that 's the one where I used to let my field go

Yes

Uh uhm

All right

Uh uhm

Yeah uhm

And where Audrey Smith lives   Audrey and  sh she 's name Terrace just across the way is a big gate where I used to go in with my pony

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

How old were you then

How old would you have been

How ol wh wh when I first got a millionaire for my neighbour twenty-four twenty-five years old 

That 's when your grandma came first time with me 

So you went into the navy when you were eighteen  and 

Eighteen yes

I was in the navy I was in the navy five days after I was eighteen 

And I was on board a ship six days after I was eighteen

Uhm uhm

Uhm  and then so you were in the navy for

Six and a half

Six and a half years

Uhm yes

Uhm 

Yes 

And where they build those houses near that bungalow  that 's in the that 's what I termed my school garden in there

There used to be a school gardens there

Because there used to be a little brook running there 

Mrs Collier said she 'd like to come down one day and uh get some knowledge of her husband Mark

John Mark

Mark her husband 's called

John 's the one that does the training

that 's right

He had a stroke didn't he

He she said he was mentioning about me and he wanted to come down before he had this stroke and get the news around you see because a young chap  does the writing up about Blandford

He 's only got he 's only got a smattering of knowledge of it really

I mean he he isn't mentioned in the history of it really 

And her son yes of course he 's a lot younger than me you see 

And uh  but they mention the names of the places streets and all that in Blandford crosses and all

I don't know I don't know where they are 

I only know them by by the old name

I don't know them by the new name at all 

Souwester Cross

I never have

Always known to me as Tottenham 's Cross Roads  you see

I 've never known   and uh

Uhm

Yes

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

They 're thinking of putting houses everywhere at the moment

Yes yes 

They didn't know how Church Street  got the how the name of Duck Street originated and I told them

I I 

I wasn't how did it

It is called Duck Street now

Yes

But  Duck Street

well  Arne  the family of Arne

I 'm sorry three-or-four-words

the family of Arne had a bay grey  that size with  and they used to have a small rural farm with big Wyandotte ducks  you see

Well  at uh you know where the toll house is over at Huxley 

Then you you know that that th there used to be a stream of water in the gutter running down there perpetual

it never stopped

and it used to come down from the moor  down by s by the the

I 've got to use my hand to show it

down by the uhm Royal Oak  underneath the Royal Oak and the big chute affair and then come out and go down in the gutter 

And the ducks used to come out there every day 

And that is how it originally was named as Duck Street

How was that

Uh uhm

Yeah

Uh uhm

Uh uhm

Yeah

R really

Yeah

Big white Wyandotte ducks

No uh Aylesbury ducks I should say

Oh yeah

Uhm 

So it 's still Duck Street is it

Well I think you might be interested in uh in Advanced Revelation because is it  it 's bloody good for the software actually  uhm 

Isn't it Andrew





Uhm yes and no  

Yeah it 's very good in terms of the way it stores data I mean which is maybe is quite important element 

Uhm it 's very bad in terms of  user-friendliness or programmer-friendliness 

So it 's weak on that

But it 's very good in terms of the way it stores the stores the data

It 's very very efficient

As efficient as you can get really

Uh uhm





Yeah

I mean I haven't been able to test that

but it would seem so because

And also it 's good on uhm data space data space as well which when you 've got this much data you don't want loads of blanks floating around







Well I mean  there 's no  you 're not restricted in any way

No

It doesn't do compression

You 're not constricted in any way to the lengths of fields or the lengths of records or anything like that or how many of a certain type of field do you want 

So it 's safe in that way

I mean the compression could be done on top of that I 'm sure  like with any database really









Again I do not know 



I 'm pretty sure that it is actually

I 'm pretty sure it is

I I remember reading about something 

Yeah 

I think it is 

I think it is yeah

Yeah  we can ask them anyway

Yeah 



But if you want to come up and see and see it sometime there



You and Nick you and Nick

And I think you know probably come up when  when Andrew 's there perhaps or





Uhm well I 'll I 'll be up there from December mid-December





That 's what I 've been doing in the summer yeah

I mean the the they 're apart from the Advanced Revelation dictionary database and  so 





It might I think it might make an awful lot of sense actually because then you know the sort of the unity  between the two operations would be  

And really I mean you 're welcome to  you 're welcome to sort of adopt the things that we 've developed







How how advanced is your database

At least two and three

How how  advanced have they got



Yeah

I think uh just about 

And uhm we don't retrieve any citations at the moment 

Uhm can do a basic lookup can't you for a word and bring back the references  to where it 's in the text

Uhm it 's quite fast I think

But then  again we 're using a subset 











Yeah

Uh uhm that 's understandable

Well I 'll if you like I can negotiate something on that  because under the language survey you see what I mean the language survey being a kind of scholarly enterprise

I 'm sure we can say that you 're an additional  programme within the language survey

and  you know you just have an add-on cost rather than a whole  the whole uh site cost

I 'll see what I can do anyway









Well I I think it would be great for the it would be great for them

No

Well most most database packages if you 're producing a package  most most database manufacturers let you buy uhm I can't recall the words for it but they let you buy it so that you buy it once for a bit more the runtime version of it basically

and then you can give everyone a runtime version of it

And so I mean that 's





Yeah  like Omnus

 it 's usually quite expensive actually

Uhm 

Well I mean I 've only ever done with P C dBase before but it 's not very expensive on P C dBase but I don't know what it 's like with Advanced Revelation





Yeah

Although with with the actual dBase it wasn't much extra really

So

Yeah with Omnus it 's in the thousands

Uh no   wasn't



At least couple at least couple of thousand





I think uh they 're they 're quite they 're quite decent decent lot actually

There 're more made

They sell more

Yeah yeah

Quite big



Uhm

Yeah

I mean the advantages of being self-contained are clear

but just whether  I mean  how much work the database manufacturers have put into their software which makes it  if it is faster and so on



Is that OK





But as far as speed goes I mean I mean we 've only we 've been using incredibly slow hardware actually 

Uh we just did a did a test today with a three eight six thirty-three megahertz machine 

And that was just plugging it into the work station

it gave us more than  more than a hundred per cent speed improvement 

Uhm  but I mean the fact that we 're able to use such slow machines at all sort of amazes me 

and actually do the project











We 've got

Well I mean they 're not even two eight sixes I think

They 're they 're Tandon P Cs what what what was

A Ts  P C A Ts



I don't think there 's any reason not to stay with it really unless 

I mean  uh it 'd be nice to have  the possibility of portability to other operating systems I suppose in the future

But I think I mean being realistic about it most people are in a P C DOS environment or an Apple environment in this sort of general world aren't they





Yeah



Uhm

I know quite a few people a lot of people have Macintoshes 



We 're putting a we 're putting a Novell network in that will run at will will we can link Apples and I B Ms to

Why

For ob from from the point of view of transferring files that will be useful you know  easily

But but obviously we could we can't run  I don't think we can run A-Rev on Apples 

I think it 's unlikely 

Well maybe

Right







No

I mean so actually you know we 're we 're mainly I B M orientated













I don't think I don't think X-Windows is going to be well I 'm not really that sure but I don't think it 's that different to Windows  to Windows 





Well is there very much that you can't do under DOS I mean given the fact that machines get much faster

And the DOS impr DOS versions improve don't they

No

There there isn't really is there but uh 

There 's a certain amount of academic snobbery attached to UNIX I always feel

Yeah

I mean it 's a question of uhm it 's just a question of what happens  in terms of the market as well

I mean everyone keeps saying oh UNIX UNIX UNIX

Yeah but they 've been saying that for ten years

I remember them saying that in nineteen eighty whatever

I mean  a book machine programme





Yeah

And I mean all I B M 's attempts to change people over to other things like O S Two sort of really  flopped

 and  to uh







Yeah 

The sort of I mean these k kind of concordancing fu functions etc you couldn't do you couldn't do that within A-Rev sensibly could you 

There wouldn't be any point would there 

Uhm 

Could

But I 'd I would imagine that C U P would be a much more efficient way to do it

Mm mm

So then the interface between the database and the C programmes  is is mainly just a  uhm  a passage of data is it 

Yes I guess so 

Yeah

Uhm



Yeah

I mean we would have to get some idea if A-Rev code or or C code that 's going to be quicker on A-Rev data 

I mean either way you 've got the A-Rev data stored there

Uh uhm

It 's just a question of  which is the more efficient approach

Uhm

Yeah



I mean I presume it 's something again that we haven't done so I don't 





Yeah I don't see why not 

Yeah I mean definily definitely can





I think A-Rev is coming out in a Windows version sometime actually

Oh well 

Yeah

I saw it yesterday

You 've seen the software

Yeah

What 's it like

It 's uh 

Oh you saw it at that

You went on that day did you

Yeah I went to Milton Keynes 

Was that good

It was OK 

Uh I think it 's being released uh  early next year

Uhm

Right

It is a Microsoft Windows environment

Right

So that gives you the possibility of font handling and that kind of thing I suppose

Uhm

Uhm

Probably but I think it 's mostly character-based at the moment

Right isn't it



I think we might do as as it comes up

I mean mean it makes sense mightn't it

Yeah I mean it might be best

Yeah I mean there 's quite a sort of overhead machine overhead on Windows isn't there but I mean you you 've got to have a big big powerful machine to run it or plenty of RAM

At the same time it 's not going to have Windows then yeah

A three eight six isn't it basically



Just about









I think it is where the fu where the world 's going





Oh yeah

Right

Yeah

Are you actually thinking of that as competition I mean in terms of serious you know serious commercial competition

I guess that 's right







It 's interesting isn't it



Oh yeah



Yeah

Well certainly from your overview of those two programs they seem very limited 





Yeah

No but I mean there are some other bells and whistle hiding in there







Right

Yeah

Yeah

Uhm  that 's good

So what is to come is in  this document



Oh right











Yeah

Are you incidentally Akiva are you doing anything on the D T I uhm thingy  or whatever it 's called

Do you know



I think there 's a deadline approaching

so I thought it might be quite useful to talk cos like Sidney mentioned some possibility







right

Shall we try and get together sometime cos we 've got one or two possible  projects collocation being a  significant one



Right

Right where did you put that

Oh down at two here mm



Right







Your your end date on this is

Do you have an end date







Right

Uhm

Oh right

Is that uhm item nine





OK so it 's



OK but are you using dBase at the moment



What for



So that 's held in dBase files is it

Oh I see



No I mean you know I 've done

Most of my career has been in dBase four but I mean Advanced Revelation certainly is more  efficient storage-wise as I said

I mean it 's just

I mean I haven't any data to compare the speed or efficiency of them or how much work it is to debug them

As far as I know Advanced Revelation is far  far safer than dBase on network systems

Uhm dBase has got a very bad reputation or did have a mild uhm bad reputation indeed uhm for network systems in that everybody got a stand a stand alone package



Yeah uhm it 's just it hasn't got a good reputation

It hasn't been used enough I don't think to get one and uhm when it has been used there 's a bug which has  caused major problems

I don't know what the current state of play is on dBase



dBase four

Uhm yes it is a possibility

It 's just  I think Advanced Revelation is safer

but dBase four is more widely available actually

but some classes of people



Yeah  if you 're doing it in runtime by the way it does not it doesn't actually matter

dBase four is certainly easier to program than A Rev  and uh  A Rev is  more efficient







It is very A Rev is very much was I think designed with networks in mind wasn't it  because it came from Pick

and Pick is a sort of network system 

Your basic corpus searching and corpus indexing that 's done in C plus plus isn't it

It is not done on it is not done in 









Yeah

It does raise a point also about you know this this growth of interest in C D ROM data  uhm and we 're getting plugged into that to a larger extent now

There seems to be a sort of wave of interest

It 's certainly going a long way in the States where the players have dropped in price hugely  and uhm  presumably there is some kind of notion of a standard format for the data

I don't know what it 's based on though

I think there are various people using various formats

So the person calling is being charged thirty-eight pence a minute

Yes

And the person who 's being called

Who 's being called is charged a quid

Yeah 

Well I mean that wouldn't be a problem would it cos I would if I was having a 

Well if it 's costed and it 's paid for by the company then it doesn't matter does it 

I mean people



It still sounds bloody ridiculous

Oh yeah 

Oh god I wonder how many  days have you got at work out at their place

Stacks and stacks of memos about  things here and things there and all sorts

We got our  we got our  We got our Christmas dinner and dance next Saturday at the Sir Christopher Wren 's house in Deaton

Is that free

Yeah

Yeah



Is it

Have you got to pay for Betty to go

No

No

I have  if I want Betty to go

Yeah

Oh yeah

I bet she doesn't tell me she 's coming to your Christmas do

Uh if I want  it 's going to cost me twenty quid

Really

Oh crikey

Yeah

I want to go cos it 's free but you got to pay for your spouse

He 's stingy all right isn't he

Would be a bit of a bad deal wouldn't it

Yeah

So effectively you 'll be paying ten pounds each

Yes

And then it 's like we 've got in what a week or two weeks is it

I 've got a s a seminar on I S D N  a whole day with like dinner thrown in the middle 

I 've got that one that week

I 've got the uh coming dinner and dance on a a Wednesday or something Wednesday night

I 've got the department  dinner on the Friday night  and there 's a an office  outing out for lunch

That 's on at that week as well 

I shall spend something about I don't know I think he actually spends two weeks I shall something about eight days consecutive days

Dinners everywhere

I just can't afford it

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah

Oh you have to pay for these

Well like yes

There 's only the the official company dinner

The rest is organised by people in the department

Right and

Oh right

And you pay for it

And what do you get for this sort at Christmas

I was in different work groups

 I mean Christmas dinners

and then there are the cross-sections between a group and a group that threatens them

Perhaps you should have done

Can't afford it

And like being the first first year you 've actually had a Christmas there

you don't know which ones are going to be the good ones and which ones to avoid  cos I mean the company ones that they pay for you to go out you know like all the wine 's on and all the food 's free 

you get all the blooming directors giving all your boring crappy talks 

Yeah

Yeah

Oh I see

Yeah

Exactly

Hey

I might have to do the uh after-dinner speech at at our annual well not annual our Christmas  departmental dinner

Why

I think you should just stand up and burp   

Because our 

What

Why

We 're talking about B P 

Oh sorry

I thought you were talking about the R A F

No

I mean I 've had to do that as well

Oh yeah I got mixed up

I 've been Mr Jones  

I could toast the Queen and you know say thank you to all the V I P guests Air Air Chief Marshal X and what have you

What for

Was that all code names when you were in B P then   or was that R A F 

Yeah

Cos I mean there was Air Chief Marshal X and then there 's uh Air Marshal Z and uh

What

Who were you then

Who am I

Yeah

Oh I am uh Cadet Pilot  Cadet Pilot

Oh great

Hey listen

We 've got to uhm go and see the old vic uh the Victors

Why

And take their mail round

Well I reckon we should do that  pay cheques in

And pay the cheques

That 's Saturday 

Oh is that when it 's due

Yes

Is that when the rent 's due 

Yes

Twenty-third is that

Twenty-third Saturday

Yeah

Mm

I could do without that

another cheque for four hundred pounds

Also we 've got to do the neighbours cos it 's just getting closer and closer

Well I don't think we should now

I think it 's too late

Yeah

Yeah

I think that now it 's a bit too much like it 's too

we 're having it whether you disapprove or not

Or not

Yeah

Oh yeah

Well I mean I think we should just go and tell them anyway that they 're 

Yeah

Warn them

I think these two either side cos otherwise 

You should be forewarned

Yeah

It 's still better to go and tell them

Tell them

Yeah

It is

It 's very uhm cool 

Because I know what it 's likely to call the police round

They should be forewarned

Yes

Yes 

He Here you are

I was going to ask

 on that one 

This is great this

Who put this  cover on

Me and Matt

With drawing pins

They were already in there 

There were about half a dozen already on there

We took them all off and scraped all the  bits and pieces off

What a mess

It It was all

 in by drawing pins

They were all held on  but they 'd all come loose

Yeah

They had blankets

Blankets sheets towels about about half a dozen other old uhm covers 

Silly sod

So what what you 'll what we 'll go we 'll go two next door two one side two the other side here on 

They won't want four of us on their doorstep  because they 're having a party

We 'll do it on Saturday and get it out of the way

Yeah

Yeah 

Tomorrow

Tomorrow

Tomorrow

Yeah

We 've been saying tomorrow since since last week

No

But tomorrow 's 

Don't put off till tomorrow what you can do today

Yeah

Well my my one is the opposite

Yeah

Exactly

Never do tomorrow what you can put off until ages until at at least next week 

Me too

Uhm right

OK we 'd we 'd 

Never do anything you can get away with not doing  

Right

We 'll get that out the way tomorrow

We 'll have to to buy go out Saturday and buy some punch fluid  and we we have to get crates of beer in 

Yeah

I was going to buy excellent vodka  as well because  vodka

Yeah

Because we can keep it for ourselves right or we could we could sell it to people 



It could just get nicked

No

Not if if we put it somewhere special like 

I haven't thought of it yet

What are we talking about

Beer 

I think about the worst thing we could have at this party everyone is turns up thinking like I did when I went to Mike 's oh there 'll be an off-licence round the corner which there isn't  and then everyone 's sort of sitting around going oh well  some TV then

At least if we 've got some beer we can say right

Well we 've got some beer

You can buy it off us

But a lot like Mike 's like quite a trustworthy guy and might just like let us drink it all afterwards

If you wanted to give him six quid you did

All right

Yeah

I think that 's a good idea

But if we lock it away we can like  say yeah we got a crate

you can have it off us for twelve quid you know

I

I

Yeah

So you want to find a wholesale place then

Uh yes

There 's one in Birmingham 

Uh 

You 're telling me there 's not going to be one in West London 

I 'm telling you that we don't want to be bothered to go further than Ealing Broadway on Saturday



Are you going to drive us there

Well that 's what I was thinking relatively 

Yeah 

On Saturday

I am going in to town on Saturday

Yes

And me

What town

Shopping

Yeah

London town

Yeah

Well I don't know

Well I am not going to do all the furniture rubbish myself



Everyone 's Everyone 's buying a futon

People are arriving about well dinner time

Everyone 's arriving early

Before lunchtime

I tell you what

I 'm not going to have a repeat

What lunchtime

What we 're going to the  in the afternoon

Etc

Yeah

We 'll go in the morning then

Some Some people are

Yeah

We 've got to clear the whole house out for starters

And I 'm not doing it myself

If no one 's in sod it 's all going to stay as it is

Yeah

That 's true

I think my mum 's coming

I 'll give that

Eh

My mum 's coming

Is she 

To the party

Good stuff

Why not 

Honestly says  doing his best lying  

She is

She actually said she was gonna going to

Oh right

I am sure she will 

As long as she doesn't mind indulging  in some heavy alcohol 

Mm

Yes 

Is

Is

Bob 's coming

Yeah

Yeah 

Sime

Sime

Yeah

Martin

Yeah 

Richard

Loads of people are coming

Well he 'd better not get drunk and tell Jo what happened in the weekend  in the hope that she 'll finish with me

Who

Martin

Yeah 

You 're paranoid about it aren't you 

Well that 's what you have to live with when you do it

The paranoia

Yeah although

You 'd better not let Jo get hold of this



It 'd be criminal evidence 

That 's right

Yeah

You see

Nick 's got one on you 

 Nick could find a fork in his neck

I haven't because this is not my tape

This is

Oh right

I was going to say I won't have it 

Unless I make a copy tonight  

Anyway less of talk of infidelity

Who is talking of infidelity

 keeping hamsters

Gee I tell you Peter 's got you by the short and curlies

 She really has

Yeah

She has

Yeah

Totally

You didn't think of that did you

No  

You 'd better be nice to her

Yeah

Yeah

She could come She could come down on Tuesday and say I want fifty pounds  

She could say or else I 'm going to snitch or I 've already taken down out down the West End and go and see  something fantastic

I am taking her out down the West End next week

I hope she 's coming down  because I start work on Thursday

Work

Yeah

You know that 's where I 've been going early in the mornings and 

 she is

She 's taken a day off work

No

She 's coming down

I 'm taking a day off work 

Yes



 doesn't have to come down because he 's already here

Right 

He lives here

but  she started like trying to bribe me I  her just like it is in Fatal Attraction

and I 'll tell Jo first 

Right

That 's another thing I 've got William at home on his gap 

And it is very nice having William at home on his gap in some ways but it is you know  his life has to

Yes I know

Mm

And he 's at home 

He 's at home

But I mean he 's e he uhm  he plays the piano all day and he  plays at a ballet class and get eight gets eight pounds an hour and he

that 's wonderful because he earns sixty pounds a week and he has his friends and he goes to a concert al almost every night and I can't complain 

It 's just yet another adult 

And it 's like Chris and I if there 's no food in the fridge 

I mean Chris would  he wouldn't mind just having cereal for supper whereas William  looks in the fridge and there 's no food and he obviously 

Mm quite

Mm mm

Mm mm

Mm oh dear

Yes mm

And Sue how is it in Muswell Hill

Well Muswell Hill itself I cn can't say I 've really uhm explored got to know uhm worked out at all

Do you have one of those houses with a view

It no it doesn't

Oh

Uhm except that it looks out over a bowling green at the back which is rather nice 

And it it faces south and it has big rooms and it 's a nice house  and

And so the sun comes in

Oh yes  yes mm

Right

So it 's not g gloomy dark and depressing

No

It 's a lovely house

Good

So that 's very nice

And we 've been uhm concentrating on uhm trying to get i it organised

And how 're the children Andy

The children

Oh

Well I don't think happy

Uhm at least Dick seems to be more or less OK

He 's being very fair and dividing his time between us  absolutely you know straight down the middle  which I think is quite a strain for him because he 's not the most organised of children and of course it means you know having to work out that you 've got your games kit in the right place on a Sunday 

Uhm and Nell 's completely anti and uhm has decided that she 's going to be with Bernard

And so  that 's that 's pretty difficult because it 's not uhm  I mean it doesn't actually suit Bernard terribly well and you know there he is uhm  holding down his job uhm and running a house and running children

And I mean you have to be a pretty efficient manager of time to do that and that 's not really Bernard 's strong point

Never has been 

And he also I think wants time and space to himself to sort himself out

Absolutely

And uhm  I mean  he 'll have to think about who will look after Nell when she gets home from school

And at the moment nobody looks after Nell because she says she 's perfectly all right on her own  providing her

How old is Nell now

Fourteen 

But I ring her up  from time to time and she 's completely cutting herself off from me so it 's quite hard to tell you know what is her being deliberately monosyllabic and what is her being downright miserable 

But there 's quite a lot of being downright miserable 

Oh Sue

So I think that 's something I uh just have to you know sit back and weather more or less

and uhm as somebody put it  just be uh try and be a mattress and  sort of

You see it is very hard for her to have a sexual relationship going on in the same house at that age

I mean that 's why Chris and I were so lucky because the children were much younger

I mean you know it is in that respect a very difficult age

Or if she was eighteen she might have a sexual relationship of her own 

Mm mm

Mm

Mm

Mm

Yes

Yeah

But it must

I mean Chris and I have always been incredibly careful 

Uhm although we kiss sometimes in public so to speak

well I mean  honestly the lengths we go to

we n never lock the bedroom door because we never have because we think it 's a bit scary

And so like if William is at a concert and is coming home we can't make love because he might because he 's s even though he 's eighteen and he 's quite experienced in some ways I imagine he might just come in  which in a way is a very good thing  because he 's feeling no threat 

But it 's meant that for fifteen years  Chris and I 've been married we 've always had to be  a bit thoughtful 

And I think  for Nell to know that a happy sex life is going on in the same house  when you 're fourteen is  the worst age than if she was seven or eight  or if she was eighteen 

So she may come back to you emotionally when she 's got that sorted out 

You see even fifteen would be better

Mm

Mm mm mm

Mm mm

Mm mm

Mm

Quite

Mm mm

Mm

Mm mm

Mm

Mm mm

Well yes

I mean to some extent you know I 'm I 'm saying well it you know this might have happened whatever  you know

I mean Nell wasn't the most relaxed  of children anyhow

No 

You mean even if you and Bernard had stayed together

Even if we had stayed together there might have  you know had endless hormones and glands problems

No

Yes you might

It 's quite true 

She might have been that kind of teenager anyway

So

Mm

Quite likely I think

I was quite like that and  you know

Bolshie

Yes

And and also apt to take you know very completely irrational hates against people for what I think were probably sexual reasons

I mean  you know at the bottom it was sort  uh sexual problems 

Mm

Yeah

Well not always

You might be like me

I don't think in my case it was sexual

But I have such a thin skin I 'm always terribly easily hurt

and I find it very hard to forgive although I do  eventually 

So it might be that  as much as sexual

Mm

Mm mm

Yes yes

You know

Yes W I it 's quite possibly that too yes

She may be thin-skinned

Mm

She must she may just feel hurt by you 

And just because you 're her mother doesn't

Mm

Oh I think there 's a lot of that

In fact uhm one of the most revealing things has been that uhm she said twice at quite long-spaced intervals but if Dad finds somebody where will my home be then 

And  to me that seems as though she feels somehow that she 's got to earn herself a place in her home and that she was doing that because she was  you know keeping Dad and me together and when she failed that obviously meant that she was no good  at in an at that kind of relationship

So that if there 's if if there are a couple around uh an older couple you know  then uhm  you know they they need a sort of cementing bond of a child

and that 's her role

Mm

And that 's very rational

And and if one was a psychiatrist and supposing she 'd said that to a psychiatrist what would they say 

Mm

That 's a very good question

Because why can't you consult a psychiatrist and see wha I mean a friendly one and see what the correct response is

Because it seems such a rational thing to say

but how does one deal with it 

What 's the answer for her

I could ask somebody

what would you make of that

Mm

Well  uh as far uh

I mean she won't see a psychiatrist at all anything remotely approaching that uhm

I could ask someone 

No no

But you could ask someone

Mm

What I what I 've said to myself so far  doing my own bit on it is that I think for some reason or other she 's uhm  got feeling and I can you know see reasons for it way back that I didn't  ever really love her and that when Dick came along

I mean this this was all bound up with you know Dick coming along

And she nev she 's never actually jealous of 

But why should she feel that because other people have second children

Yes I know

but I think you know

I think it is a difficult thing and if it isn't got over properly I think can leave a lasting problem

And I think in a way I mean she is terribly nice to Dick and you know as soon as he appeared  I mean rather  unnaturally so

I think we should have you know done a bit of digging at that point sort of you know make her feel particularly special and find out if she was feeling at all bothered about it or whether she thought she had to be nice to this child because again she was earning her place

Already she was earning her place

And uhm you know while Dickon now can sort of you know say I want this I want that I don't like this I don't like that and he may not get what he wants out of it but at least he feels he can I think she feels too threatened to

I think she feels probably that uhm you know unless I need her for  uhm you know mak making my life happy then I don't really want her

And clearly I 've got what I need to make my life happy

so she can't see a place for herself

Yes

Well you see I mean rationally she 's got a point

I mean it 's a very very difficult one for those of us who leave our first husbands 

I mean rationally she 's got a point 

I mean what do you do

Mm mm

Mm mm

So again what do you do about it

What do you do

Well  I do I do things to show that I do want her need her miss her  uhm  completely  uh  gratuitously 

uhm  which at the moment is difficult because it 's it means sort of saying things like uh let 's go and buy you a new coat or let 's go and have a shopping expedition just see what we can find or let 's go to a film or something like that and kissing her

Well

Mm

And what about uhm holidays

Just you and her

would she do that

Uhm well I su suggested that but she she didn't want to

And and somebody else said well maybe that was a bit of a mouthful and you know try just an evening on your own together

Like skiing or something

Or a day trip

Yeah

Or something like that uhm 

so you know so far  none of those suggestions 

The other thing is uhm  do you confide in her 

Does she feel excluded because you don't exactly confide in her

Well  I don't

But then  uh I haven't

I mean I never have 

and I 'm I 'm rather scared that you know that would seem rather artificial to her and as an attempt to win her over

and of course  you know she 's terribly alive to things like that  uhm

But you could start slowly

But I agree it 's very difficult if you never have

It 's would it 's also very difficult if if  communication is  virtually nil

It is but that surely would improve with time 

Well I think uh yes I mean I think it will

But you know that 's uh that 's not something I can  start in on straight away







Uhm uhm

Really





Uhm

Many many years ago we were interested in it

Before we had children 

One loses interest in everything when one has children

About ten per cent 

Or Jane 's teeth coming through 

Do you mind

Uhm ooh

Feeling your stubble darling 

Feeling your stubble darling 

Well I wish you wouldn't  my stubble

Well you  put your feet up on me

Pardon

If you didn't put your feet up on me

This goes back to this is going back a long way

Jane 's feet were on the table Christmas nineteen seventy 

Oh dear

Well there was Mummy being so embarrassed because Jane 's feet were on the table

Jane was one

Did I have shoes on 

No

Ah well they 're lovely little feet

I 'm sure

They were dear little feet actually 

How how did I manage that

I was at a high table and I had my feet

No no she you were in Mum 's lap and you used to put your feet on which is completely normal

I don't think you were even slightly embarrassed about that

Yeah

It 's a funny thought isn't it that I was embarrassed

Where was that

Oh in Adelaide of course

Only in Church Terrace would I be embarrassed

Oh right

Oh yes

We were over on our holidays

Ah there 's an ant

So what

Well catch it

Well put him outside

Let him go on to 

Look

he 's on the toaster

Now put him outside nicely  then brush him out

He may be somebody else 's ant you know 

Well I remember killing an insect in that train in India

I know I 've never forgotten it actually

Killing a what

Killing an insect on the train in India

Mmm uproar

Extraordinary uproar yeah

Mmm

What from me

From the 

The  yeah

We were travelling in January

Oh I see yeah 

Woops

Was Dad then cast to the outer reaches of Hell

No it was wonderful

We were travelling

oh we 'd just left the Ashram actually

We were travelling with some  third class

very important people

I can't remember what their  

And they flinched and it was awfully embarrassing 

You wouldn't normally would you Dad

You don't even swat flies now do you

No daddy 's a Jain

He 's a paid up Jain 

Card carrying

Do you sweep the floor before your before you walk on it so you don't tread on any ants

Now how did you know that

That 's right yes

Ah that 's my Thomas Mann coming into it into it

Whoa

How can you possibly know that

Not a common known known common

These uhm what is it ascetics or something

Commonly known fact among English women

Uhm you know they they sweep the ground before them and they uhm

And what else do they do

Oh they they they go out in the cold with no clothes on or something



Oh heck 

Not even a turban

That doesn't 

What 's that

they go out in the cold with no whats on



In their birthday suits 

In their birthday suits

That doesn't prove anything

And they what 's

They they they uhm have fire and everything and they burn themselves a lot and they

Now come on

be more precise Jane come on

What what

Uhm

They 'd need to after being out in the cold

They do they really they really make their bodies uhm suffer don't they

Uhm

Well who are they  we 're talking about

These these people in uhm India

Yes  

They 're foreigners

Oh don't be so mean

You 're so mean

This is going back to a legend about you know 

A legend

Right now

Some the southern peop the southern Tamils

The Tamils of southern India

Yes all right but in this legend

It 's uhm it 's it 's called

Actually it 's been made into a play

Have you heard about it

At the uhm The Transposed Heads

No I didn't

Oh it 's really good

Who 's Thomas Mann anyway

I 'm showing my ignorance

He wrote Death in Venice

So who is he

And The Magic Mountain

What nationality is he

German

Kraut

But he he wrote this story called The Transposed Heads

Yes a Kraut

And uhm it 's a really good story actually

And when did he write 

Is he modern

Mmm

And so what 's he doing writing about India

Uhm well it it was a way of 

He deals with these themes and it was a way of dealing with the themes of duality and everything

And of course The Transposed Heads means

Are you sure it 's in India anyway

Oh oh I 've read I 've just bought a book called Doubles

You might be interested in it

It 's about the double in history

Yeah yeah



Yeah might be interesting 

About the doppelganger

Uhm yeah and has it got uhm H Hoffmann there you know the uhm  and all that

Probably

Well I 'll give it to you

I 'll give it to you

Anyway uhm



Yes indeed

What

The Magus Zaroaster 

Daddy and I had a very funny experience with this

Daddy c walked in the door one morning walked in this door I

and I just read out a read a book review in The Times that morning and

and Dad hadn't looked at the newspaper

And and in the book review there were two lines which caught my eye which were The Magus Zaroaster  met his own image walking in the garden

Isn't that right

And Dad Dad walked in half an hour later saying I 've got these two lines of poetry going through my mind  and I don't know where it 's from



Now that 's spooky

Mmm

Mmm

Well he read it the previous day in The Times didn't he

He didn't

No no no it was that morning 's book review

No it 's Shelley

It was Shelley

He he quoted it didn't he

It 's Shelley yes

And it 's also in Charles Williams

 don't tell will you 

Oh well

But it 's nevertheless very strange

Odd

Mmm

You said actually it happens to us all the time in this 

Well it happened this morning

Pip phoned me last week

Also he phoned me wanting your address

or was that

Oh that was someone else

That was Julian

Julian

Julian lost his address book 

Julian 's doing very well

He 's s soloing now

Was it Julian

Is he

Where

Well Doncaster uh Concert Hall one place and uh he was going to go to

I don't think he 's at Edinburgh this year

Really

What sort of songs does he sing

Does he sing lieder or something

Something like that

Songs that baritones sing

I don't know  mmm 

Oh he 's a baritone

Are you employed in a job like that

I mean does he sing

He 's a schoolteacher

Well that 's what I thought yes

I was suggesting

Well I think uhm that he he sings with a choir  and the choir

and this is the Baroque Singers of York or something or the Bach Choir the York Bach Choir 

and uh he he arran the leader arranges uhm venues and gigs 

Oh yes quite

Ah yes yes

Mmm

Does a choir  does a choir have a gig

Did the Baroque Singers

I don't know

I 'm afraid I really don't know

Must give us a ring

Well he was with the Baroque Choir in St Andrews and with the Bach Singers 





Rock and roll

I think we 've had enough with gigs don't you 

Do you ever sing

Well only informally  you know in the shower or 

Has he got a nice voice

Yes it sounds quite nice

Mmm

Uh well his uhm music teach teacher

He travels to Manchester for music lessons and his music teacher thinks so highly of him says Julian that uhm he 's giving him a whole day instead of half a day  on Sunday 

Well I mean I think as I say I 'm only going by what Julian said

He he his uhm former teachers before he was going to uhm 

What an idea you 've got

Yes 

Uhm  and he 's going for auditions at the R N C M and uhm  his teacher said that they 'll never find a more more beautiful voice

I thought you said more beautiful than you 

More beautiful

What do you mean we 're alike 

Has he got

To the exclusion of everything else

Everything else yes 

Have you met Julian

Oh he 's been invited to sing in Venice as well 

Mmm 

We have to cough up the air fare but I don't know when

Three hundred pounds

Where

Three what

He 's bringing his choir to Venice  and he 's soloing 

Bet he doesn't go

 Raymond

Now that would have  been something to remember there 

Did you meet Raymond

Isn't it uhm in Vienna Mummy 

It was yes 

But Mum one 's in Austria OK

Mummy 's always had this Vienna problem OK 

Now



Yes it 's funny

I don't know what it is



I have an Amsterdam and Antwerp problem as well

Oh dear

A what

Amsterdam and and Antwerp

We nearly got on a Venice plane going to going to Vienna anyway

Yes it 's a problem





John







It may mean he 's not normal





Mmm but then but actually we have disci discovered that everybody 's called John

Not your generation

I 've got a lot of Julians in my class

Well look the the sort of uhm 

Generation

Julian and Jonathan seem to be the  main ones

The chaps around forty to forty-five are all called John

Mmm  but with  exceptions

But I mean lots of them

I have a friend John who 's in Linguistics with me

That 's the only John I know

Well there are probably more

And before you came here I think you took a course

was it uh at a at a Polytechnic in Wales

is that right

Yeah

I started it

I left after a term 

had a bit of trouble though with the natives

so one term

Right

Oh not the Welsh was it

Mm  and I wasn't particularly uh  convinced that the degree would be worth having 

Was that Philosophy or something else

That was Humanities

It included Philosophy but uh  a wide range of others

and it might have been a good degree

but it wasn't uh

Yes

Not what you

Not what I wanted to do

So anyway you 're on the one now that you  you 're comfortable with in this one

And that 's good

and of course it has a connection hasn't it with University College

and it was ever s

Did there ever seem to be much of a connection between the school and the

Mhm

Between the school and the college uhm 

No there 's not particularly no

Uh I mean more or less uh 

you went where you  wanted to go afterwards

No I see

Sure

Didn't make a big thing when we went down there yeah

I met once or twice I think I met the headmaster there when he came to some  you know when people come from schools to check out the place once a year

And uh that 's uh that was a few years ago 

Yes

Mhm

Fine good

But the thing to do is we 're gonna going to look forward and see the f the areas you 're interested in  wanting to get into because philosophy is good general background for all sorts of things 

Doesn't give one skill like many of the courses here

Mm



Well it 's not vocational

No  that 's right

but then uh you 'd have chosen long ago and had  at something you wanted to do 

But the creative side 's the one you 're you 're you 're you 're working on and keen on

yeah and also or possibly musician

you 're involved with that

Mm Mm

Yeah but I mean obviously  it would it would be better to have such a profession in order to fall back on  and all that sort of thing 

Yeah

And is that where you where the teaching came in

Yeah 

Because many do write while they teach or do other things

or uh let me think 

Was it uh

Richard Adams was in the Civil Service as a lawyer and and he suddenly wrote Watership Down and then he was able to leave

Yeah

T S Eliot was wor doing something at Faber 's round the corner for years and then he suddenly 

I think he worked in a bank too at one stage 

T S

T S Yeah I 'm sure

Lloyds Bank someone once told me

I think that 's right 

So you 're ticking on the writing side possibly the music

But how much have you got let 's say in the music side

Have you had to  got any paid performances or something 

That 's right

Is that right uhu

Mm

Yeah

And uh so

No no uhm 

Uh   I 've been  rejected from a record company

Well that 's a that 's a tape I sent them that I 've done myself 

But mainly uh  I need other people  to work with and at the moment don't

Well like a friend of mine who 's been learning guitar and we are working together at the moment but uhm  I dou I don't think that I could do it on my own  particularly

Right

And was it it 's singing and playing

Yeah but more the singing and actually more the song writing 

There is uhm

I wan I want I want to take singing lessons but I 'm not a particularly good singer

So uhm the idea of selling songs  appeals from that point of view to to actually hear them done well

Well uh yes 

Mm right

Right 

But that 's

yeah you got to

as you say you probably got to get a bit of help on that  training or whatever

And probably even when one 's writing songs and polishing up the way you 'd use the idioms and all that cos it 's going to be part of it

Mhm

Mm

Are there any courses you know I can look up and see if there are any   any

or is it more you do it and you hear of someone who 's good at and  I 'm thinking of song writing and any

I know that with authors there 's uh something called the Society of Authors which is more for writing and publishing articles and publishing and that sort of thing

And I mean in the music business  there 's an equivalent  sort of group of people

Mhm

Yeah

I I really don't know I mean

The way that I  would approach th those sort of things would be just to do them as an interest as a hobby

and uhm if they if you got somewhere then that 's great

but n not to sort of pin too much on it

No no

Yeah  and straight up to the top

Make too much of a thing of it yeah

Uh that 's sort of lack of confidence you know so

Right

I 'm just sort of looking

There 's very sometimes I was surprised

in Floodlight you can get the most outlandish and interesting courses in areas you never think of

but I 'm just uh 

Sometimes if one 's mixing possibly with other people who are doing the same sort of thing you know you 've got  half a dozen courses in solo singing

but I don't think

That 's just classical stuff

I don't know 

Just the same it 's sometimes worth looking through  uhm 

You can never know you might

That 's right

Mm

Writing production workshop which uh which is under music

There 's uh one course there

I don't know

about two pa pages

Or music-related

These are all under the music theme  and rehearsal workshops and that sort of thing 

and it 's not always  

But sometimes it 's worth looking to see if there 's anything that comes into  that sort of thing

But you 'd probably know that music scene much better than I would

Well I 'd actually expect that those sort of courses are very uh heavily subscribed uh  heavy just like

Yeah timing 's important because usually they start mid September going through for the year evenings

But uh on the other hand when Floodlight comes out usually late July early August it 's worth looking out looking down the thing

and if one says right could be around next year in London or wherever

If it 's somewhere else they may have an equivalent to Floodlight 

It 's worth looking down because yeah sure if you 're there not now yes I know cos you 've got finals and everything else but another year with a bit of you know preparation  if I can get get some useful background for that it 'd be worth uhm  uhm  investigating those

They come out late July August

Mm

Mm

Mm



Yeah do here have a  uh

While you 're looking at that I 'll also check down the list  for the Extra-Mural Department of the University who have  some

I think they 're not too good on music 

There 's quite a bit on media 

Uhm  media studies 

uhm where 's all the bit on music

It 's silly 

Certificate in harmony and counterpoint

Well that sounds a bit formal



Uhm  no I think their musical side very much is the  classical  and something on the twentieth century

No this is that the the media stuff is one that 's sort of looking to how to make videos and recording things  and might be of interest

I think there are courses on screen writing and that sort of thing  subediting 

But these are all the these are all the sort of  deals where there 's uh a lot of money in it for a very few that uh

Oh yes

You 've got to  I suppose have something very special to offer

Exactly

Yeah

Not really worth pinning too much on it

No 

But still plugging away just in case but OK they 're 

I suppose what we now need to look at is uhm  the complication of something else to have as your main stream while this is going on on the side as it were  but so you could but the important thing so that also whatever you do has a gives you enough time to do that instead of being a busy yuppy working like a doctor hundred and twenty something hours a week or whatever

Uh  but teaching is one that you 've looked at and feel could be a possibility

Mhm  yes exactly

Mhm

Right right

Mhm

Well uh the the the only trouble with that is that obviously there 's not a lot of call for teaching philosophy  and there 's a certain amount of people who want to teach it at whatever level

So uhm  it would have to be something else

and  uhm  that would that would be  either English  or uhm  you know just general primary stuff

Yeah 

not

Mm mm mm

Yeah

Yes

A a and more likely I suppose primary because your first degree has got to relate pretty closely if you 're going to get on a course in most cases

Yeah that was  mhm

So that 's really unrealistic is it wanting to do to teach English 

It 's going to be tight uh

I 'd say possibly near to not not entirely ruled out

What you have to do is maybe check  say in if say you wanted to do a course in London at say the Institute of Education or at uh uh uh uh uh King 's or wherever

Goldsmiths ' 

Because the each course has

They 've got a bit of discretion

On the other hand there are these there are rules

The Government say there must be a s high degree of relevance  in the degree subject

But it 's worth getting a prospectus maybe popping in or ringing up one of those centres since suppose you want to  take teaching training in London 

Check it out

and uh if you if you could show them there 's enough in what you 've studied within your course that would relate to literature and maths and and whatever 's taught you might just squeak in

But I suspect primary might be more likely

But then you 'd have to think would I like to work with that age range

You might well you might say yes that 's such a you know the the the five six till ten eleven sort of age and or not 

That 's another thought

And also in any area of teaching you look for uhm any experience you 've had with the relevant age range

If you haven't got it then it might mean a year off and then  working with youth or community work or some sort of relevant age group

You might be able to get some practice or doing C S V community service volunteers 

And  it 's a half thing that might come into

Oh and certainly use the time to visit schools different sorts different schools

Sit in on classes

Yeah

Mhm

Mm

Mhm

Mhm

Mhm

Well the the thing that uhm  matters at the moment  is that I was off I worked for three years before coming back to college

And uhm I think that the time for taking years out is really gone and uhm would want to go straight into some sort of training after

Right sure

Right

Let 's come down to the business  that you 're here for

You graduated  in the summer now  and it was the  Architecture Planning  Building and Environmental Studies

Yeah 

Yeah yeah

And I did archit did architecture  that section

It was architecture was it

Right so it was your part one  that you did

Yeah

The main course yeah that 's right yeah

OK 

On what did you  I mean did you decide at that stage to continue in architecture

No not really

I kind of  I mean  I I started the course  thinking that uhm I 'd sort of do the full seven years and stuff

but like I 'm just going through the course

I just just realised that it was actually the st study of architecture I really enjoyed 

And uh you just kind of like get a a few hints at what actually working in the profession 's like

and I didn't really like the idea of it 

Uhm people who had come back uh to do their to do their final years and stuff like that after working you know in in industries  which is like an an office with with you know people with drawing boards and stuff like that

It didn't really appeal to me quite honestly 

So no

Mm

Mm

Mhm

Mm

Mm

So you decided that you didn't want to pursue that further as a profession

Not really

No

But I was I was happy to happy to do the degree because  I found I found the degree really interesting

It 's a great degree because it 's actually quite kind of mind expanding

lots of levels not just like learning knowledge but playing with things

and your mind was creative as well

Yeah  yeah

Yes

Just going back before uhm you came to the Bartlett uh you mentioned in here briefly that you were at Manchester  for the rest of your 

That 's right

Yeah 

Yeah I was there for one year

What What were you doing there

I was doing Town Planning

Right 

And was that straight from school

Yeah

Yeah that was yeah

Straight from Straight from A levels kind of thing 

And uh  so I just went up there and and didn't really enjoy the course and decided that I wanted to do something

Mhm

Right 

So it was the course that wasn't

It was the course

It was a kind of combination of things really

I didn't really know the uni the the sort of scene at university

it 's quite quite impersonal and being in halls and stuff like that at the college with two thousand people

But no it 's a lot to do with the course as well

And you know it wasn't kind of wasn't really stimulating me enough really after after kind of like years of of of being kind of like  sort of battery educated if you like

You know what I mean uhm with with O levels and A levels and stuff like that I got to a point where I was kind of  thinking for myself about my life

And I actually decided that because I 'd always been sort of like told by teachers ah you 're good at this you should do this and you should do this as well because I was always really good at science and stuff like that

And actually I 'm more interested in in in doing creative things than actually in science

Yes

I know yeah

Mhm

Yes

Yes

Mm

Mhm

Mm

Oh right

So having done one year of Planning  what made you decide to then go into the Architecture

Yeah

Uhm  well it was kind of a related field

I actually started I started here doing Planning doing the Planning route of the course  of the general course which is Architecture Planning Building blah blah

And uh  I started doing that route

And one of the one of the des one of the electives

I was doing this actually kind of Design elective which is no not the main the main crux of the Architecture course

Mm

And I was just really enjoying it and doing quite well in it  and I just decided that that 's what I wanted to do

It was quite pretty stimulating stuff and I really enjoyed it 

So I just switched

and it was quite easy to switch within the within the once you 're actually within the kind of like the course  in the Bartlett

Yes

Did you

Right

Yes

Mm  Mm

Mhm

Right 

Right

So when you switched yes

Yes 

In the Bartlett

Yeah

When you switched t to the emphasis being on Architecture  did you initially think that you wanted to go into that as a career or were you doing it just as a degree because you en enjoyed the subject

Pretty much yeah I 've got to admit

I 'm just doing the I 'm just doing the degree because it was it really interested me 

I was really interested in that

I di I wasn't thinking too far ahead 

Uhm  there were doubts in my mind as to whether I was going to actually continue uh uh and become an architect because uh I actually wasn't allowed to have s uh five years ' grant by the by my local authority because I 'd screwed up a bit with the uh  with the thing in Manchester  you see

And I 'd already had a year 's grant uh which  had hadn't produced anything kind of thing

So they only let me have three years ' grant 

So I wouldn't admit I I knew in my mind that it was it was going to be difficult to do it under two years ' study

But  yeah a bit much uh I was quite I was quite kind of like theoretical about it

And I thought I 'm enjoying doing these non-stop learning things

And it doesn't really matter if there is any particular career about at the end of it which I think lots of people think when they go to university

You don't You don't know enough then but you you don't really think about in three years ' time 

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah mm

Yeah

Mm  mm

Mm mm

Mm

Right 

Right

Mm 

Yeah

Yeah

You don't know enough

Yeah

So during your final year  did you have any thoughts at that stage as to what you wanted to do upon graduating

Yeah

During my final year  uhm

Were you too busy doing your  projects

Uhm  no no pretty much

I still I Well I mean I still don't really know exactly what I want to do

Mm

Yeah yeah

Did you apply for anything in the final year

Apply for

Any jobs

No no

I was actually I was actually quite keen on getting out of education 

A And uhm I was actually kind of relishing actually sort of getting to June and and just getting free and just thinking I 'll get a job in a shop

and I 'll I 'll sort of uh live in a council flat quite into the idea of that of just actually getting out of the whole scene and becoming a real person kind of thing and just working in a chip shop or something like that

And then I just And then you just realise that  you just can't do it

I mean it 's a sort of dream stuff and  you know 

Mm

Right

Yes yeah

Yeah mm

Mm mm

Mm

Mhm mm

So when you graduated then  when did because you said I think coming up the stairs that that you 've been applying for lots of different jobs

when did you start that

Mm

I it started about  I must have started about sort of July 

I had a sort of couple of months when I just didn't do anything 

I mean

Yeah

Ju July or August or something like that I think

Yeah

And I 've been applying quite quite regularly since

I 've been really really sort of working at it every day

I mean I 've been 

Because you haven't got anything else to do you you just have to do it

Yeah yeah just recover yeah

Mhm mhm 

So what kind of jobs had you mainly been applying for

Well I started off applying for jobs that I was kind of like i in architecture really just the sort of jobs that basically just to earn just to earn some money i i in something that I could perhaps become quite proficient at

Uhm  but as you probably know the uhm I mean the architecture sce the the architecture scene at the moment is  is pretty grim

You know what it 's like

Just no jobs

I mean ou out of everyone that I know that I went to college with  uhm all of the real sort of bright kids there that that are real keen really keen on architecture and that got a first and stuff like this you know  you know lots of them haven't got jobs

I only know of a few a handful of people that actually got jobs 

Yeah mhm

Mhm

Mm

Mm

Yeah 

Mhm  mm

Mhm  I know

Property construction 's been really badly hit yeah

Yeah 

So I started off doing that and I just realised you know there 's just not any point so I just moved on to other things and and I 've been applying for jobs in in in things like because I 'm quite interested in in writing 

I 've done a bit of writing before

I 've done a bit of free-lance writing for for various for music papers and stuff like that

Mm mm uhm

And And so I started applying for jobs in that field journalism and in publishing and just anything anything like that 

And also gen generally things that kind of like combined combined creativs creativity with more mundane things like administration and stuff like that

Arts administration

I 'm not really sure what it uh completely entails or anything like that

but it just seemed  basically anything that 's in The Guardian on on on Monday

Mm

Yeah

Mm

Mm

Mm

Yeah

Yeah mhm

Mm

Mm yeah yeah  yeah

And approximately  how many jobs do you do you think you 've applied for

I 've applied for a lot actually

I 've got a lot

In my In my cupboard I 've got a lot of rejections 

Uhm  I 'd say  about I 'd say about forty or fifty or something like that about

Ten fifteen more

Yeah

Yeah

And have you had any interviews

I had  one interview which was for a a a a a shop job in Bond Street which was

It was just kind of a job I wasn't really interested in doing anyway so

So no I haven't had any any kind of interviews that I 've actually actually really wanted to get uhm  really wanted to take

Right

Mhm 

Mm

Mm  mm

Mm mm

And of those forty or so jobs you 've applied for have they mainly been in response to vacancies that you 've seen advertised

Oh yeah virtually all of them apart from the ones in architecture  which uh I just kind sent out loads of blind things you know to all the to all the firms and stuff like that like you do you know to see if they had any places

But yeah they 've all been  they 've all been  

Right right

Yeah

Yeah yeah

Right  right

Yeah  mm

And you said you were looking in the Guardian uhm on Monday obviously

Yeah yeah

Where else do you look John

Well uhm just looking

That 's really kind of uh quite specific really cos they have a certain sort of job and that

That 's your main source

That is pretty much and on Saturday as well and on the Independent on Wednesday and those sort of things you know

Also in Also in the Standard I 've been looking quite a bit

I 've been just for general jobs you know cos they sometimes have quite interesting things there uhm

Yeah

Mmm

Mhm

Mmm

Yeah

Yeah

How can I best help you over your careers advice

Uh well I haven't looked into the area very much

I 'm a bit confused really about  uhm sort of what options are available

We 've had some talks on clinical psychology and Master 's which appeals quite a lot but  uh I mean that sounds so competitive and everything and if I were to be able to do it I would see that as something in the future 

And I was just wondering sort of i in the time in between  about sort of jobs or other possible courses that are that way orientated

and also I 'd be very interested in travelling and working abroad if possible

 and I wondered if you knew of any medical organisation that can sort that out 

Yes

Yes

Right

Uhm  the quick answer in terms of of going abroad and and actually being paid for it  i would be associated with uh English teaching  uhm

Mm

Is that the Tefl sort of thing

That 's a Tefl or teaching in English in Japan uh the the JET scheme

JET scheme

Have you come across that  uhm

They have something like three hundred places each year  uhm 

And you go for a year

You become part of the sort of Japanese educational system uhm with all that that implies like uhm sort of instant response to your boss 's command  

Uhm  it can at worst be uh very lonely and sort of isolated 

Uhm  on the other hand lots of people who go say how much they have enjoyed it

And they do uh respond and blossom as a result

Uhm  we can find out details about that and just what 's involved and how you go about applying

It is quite popular of course

Mm

Oh yeah

Mhm

Mhm

Do you need to be qualified don't you teaching English

You don't

No no 

Uhm  now whe where they 're in competition with others uhm they then apply a criterion 

Uhm I would have to check that from the literature

Uhm  but that 's certainly one way of getting getting around the world uh and being paid

The other thing is to consider the Tefl uhm which  at best I think would would mean taking  uhm  a course probably three months which gets you the R S A certificate 

Uhm and there are various places where you can do that

Yeah

Right

That 's very expensive isn't it doing it

Uh several hundreds 

Yes 

Uhm  then having got that your chances of going uh somewhere else and and using it in the year off or whatever  are are are greatly increased 

The other thing you could do is is is is is do something for money here for a number of months and then blow it on you know row around the world or whatever for the next six months

Yes

Then spend it 

Do you know of any sort of 

Like the When we had the talk on clinical psychology and stuff you know you need a lot of experience not just with people with problems and stuff

And I was wondering if there were any opportunity to do anything like that abroad  uh as a volunteer if not as a paid

Uhm  yes I 'm just looking at the sort of uhm  typical  progress of aid they list here uhm 

I can't find them anywhere for the minute

That 's all right 

That actually points to  this route here uhm which sort of indicates 

And then there 's the M Phil in Clinical Psychology 

Uhm but obviously they would they would suggest that in some cases it might be better to come on to that having got uhm  some hands-on experience

Uhm and I guess there it 's really a question of whether you would like to sort of work uh uh uh in the Health Service or sort of caring counselling areas  uhm

Right

I 'd be quite keen to try anything like that  really

Right 

Uhm have you come across these little booklets 

No what 's

Or are you at uh at the beginning of the sort of job search

I don't think so no

This term

Uhm these are available downstairs too and I would recommend uhm  looking through that

Uhm there are two or three probably that that 're of interest

There 's one on This one is a general look at social sciences 

Uhm  and a certain amount about uh  psychology  in there

Uhm and then there are some in terms of of working in the health area  uhm  these two 

And  there 's quite a lot about uh clinical psychology here 

So if you like I think that 's probably  you know quite a good  base on which to start 

This one in terms of health in the private area talks more about uh uh uh psychoanalysis

Well  might be worth looking at

I 'm not sure whether you uh 

Looks quite impressive doesn't it

Mhm

Oh right

Right

It doesn't appeal so much

It doesn't

OK

Well you can probably probably leave that one 

But certainly those two would be would be quite uh  quite interesting

Uhm  have you talked to your tutors about uh an M S C  here in in London

Uhm in clinical psychology sort of thing

Oh we 've had lectures on it and stuff

I  I haven't actually talked to my individual tutors or anything 

Yeah

Probably worthwhile doing that I think you know just to say  how do you think I rate 

Uhm uhm is there a possibility if I express an interest

I mean you can do the two things in parallel

You can always say look this is to be preferred

But as a  contingency plan and backup  it 's probably as well to uh to look at those two options rather than just just the single one 

So don't put all your eggs in in one basket  particularly as funding for higher degrees is uh is you know diff difficult to get  uhm 

and I 'm I 'm not sure how how funding would be applied in in your case

It might be the local authority could use its discretion 

Uhm  there may be some funds that the department knows how to tap 

There may be the odd scholarship

You know there 's someone 

Yeah

Yeah 

Because they don't come cheaply

Right

Yeah

Right 

In one basket  yeah

Uhm

Is this for fees or for

Yeah

The general impression I got from the talk was that  uh before you sort do the course  you really have to have  quite of bit it 's preferable to have quite a bit of experience don't you think

Yes yes

I think like an M B A uh in industry and commerce it 's as well to have got some feel for what what life out there is like 

so you 've got more to bring to the course

and you can interpret what they 're saying to you in more than one framework  whereas unless you 've done a lot of vacation work perhaps helping elderly or sick people  disturbed people voluntary work you probably haven't got a very wide framework  against which to relate

Mm

Right

Mm

No

Is it Do you know much about sort of applying for jobs in this area 

No I don't really uhm  for two reasons

I 've only just transferred into the uh Careers Service uhm

and I haven't yet had a programme to take me into those areas that have uh asked for particular details

Uhm  so my best uh help for you is really to to to instruct you where to go for for first base information 

Uh and then having got that at the end of the day it 's got to be your decision anyway  because I won't enter into a contract that says you ought to go and do that 

All I can say is look from the options you 've got  uh and your background look at one two three

Mm

Right

Mm

Yes 

Mm

Right 

Do you know if sort of if there are other Master 's courses that are maybe just a year and stuff on  that uh sort of are related to them

There are two two directories that I can direct you to  uhm which will give you the first lead on that

Uhm  and both of them are available downstairs 

And the information for  all the courses that we 've got again is is here  uh on the ground floor

So if you if you will go downstairs and then you could look through these two postgraduate guides

Uhm and then I 'll show you where the others are

Probably you won't want to go down and look at that today

but at least you 'll  know  what the structure is

Uhm  and these are u uh uh uh U K based courses 

Uhm if you if you wanted to go abroad and and and uh uh uh uh do a Master 's uhm  there may be some sort of reference to it

but most of them here as I say are uh are U K based 

Uhm  whether the department has any suggestions for overseas  uhm you have to ask Adrian Bowman or whoever 

But that yes that that 's certainly another another option 

Uhm  the other thing is I guess  to ask whether you 've also considered the sort of occupational psychology areas  as well as the clinical 

It takes one more into sort of uh industry and commerce with uhm personnel and  job design and ergonomics that sort of thing 

Mm

Right

Mm

Mm

Right    mhm

Uhm 

Yeah

Uhm well we 've only just sort of started a course in that

At the moment it doesn't appeal so much

but I mean  I wouldn't be opposed to  if I could get a job trying something else  uhm sort of short placements and things like that in that area

but I don't think I 'd like to do a course in that now

Yeah

No 

It 's just that uhm there are quite quite a lot of of openings in that area for which uh under the general heading of of any discipline  you could be looked looked up under

Mm

I suppose sort of like a few opportunities and stuff  uhm

Mm  or beyond that you know thinking even less  degree-related  anything else you 've particularly enjoyed in in your years so far not  not necessarily at College even  that you might want to use and think about for for career purposes

Uhm

Uhm  I don't think so  not at the moment uhm 

I I just sort feel like that I would quite like to to work and be travelling maybe  to work in  hopefully the clinical areas but 

Yeah

What do you reckon your your sort s strong selling points are

How How would you  defend your strengths and and uh what you 're good at and what you enjoy

Wh wh What 's the package of   actually



Uhm

 

Uh I don't really know

but I I did some volunteer work over the summer just one day a week  at a are they called Minds or Drop In  Day Centre

and that was quite successful really 

Uh uh I enjoyed it for a start  but 

but I seemed to get on fine with everybody there

and sort of good response there  so I guess  

Yeah

Mhm  yeah

Right

And you felt comfortable and uh

Mm I thoroughly enjoyed that

Good

I think that 's very important

I mean one of the principles we work on is  your career is going to occupy something like sixty thousand hours  

So you need something that you 're going to enjoy because if you don't enjoy it you know you won't  reach your full potential  uh and you won't you won't you won't perhaps succeed as well as you could in doing something you did enjoy

Yeah

Did enjoy

Now I spoke to Karen this

When did I speak to Karen

On

When did I speak to Karen

She rang me on Tuesday 

She had a big argument with her mother on Sunday



Really 

Yeah

They were calling each other everything under the sun basically

But when

How long how long was she staying for

Indefinite

Really

I think so

I don't know 

Not quite sure

but apparently uhm Karen 's mother asked Neil to do the hoovering

he refused

she started shouting and somehow Karen got involved

She called uhm Ian an ugly bastard 

She called Karen a dirty Jewess

She didn't

Her mother

Her own mother

I mean that 's

Ap apparently they just really had a big argument

And Karen and Ian want to buy  her half of the mortgage out  so they 'll have too much mortgage

Yeah

It really is

I know

With Ian only a tennis coach

Yeah

Well even now

I mean if he has good rates you know he 's good bank rates and he 's got a steady job

That 's true

Yeah

I mean Father I suppose can always help I mean because I mean they still I mean Father and Mother sort of they still don't get on very well anyhow so

Sounds like she 's uhm the mother 's feeling really guilty about uh 

Well Karen reckons that she 's just kind of jealous of Karen and Ian because she 's got nothing out there apart from Salvatore

Because she 's got a lot of money she doesn't do anything all day long

Well she 's bored 

even

 yeah

Dear  

Just spends loads of money

But is she is she still in the house then

She hasn't moved out to a hotel or anything

No

She walked out on she went back to Rome on Sunday

Really

Without saying goodbye 

Oh dear

It does not bode very well

No

So that Karen 's a bit cheesed off

I 'm going to give her a I 'm seeing her on Saturday

We 're going into Kingston

 What a nice thought

To do some Chris Christmas shopping 

You did that already once with her

You won't get anything  

Well I need to get Clare a a clock 

I 've been waiting to speak to Alastair and Cheryl

Cheryl said she c she 'd ring me back but she never does

If you want to know what to get them 

Uhm I sp I 've been getting into contact with Clare from uhm Washington because she 's actually moved

She rang me up  uh after that time I bumped into her and we didn't speak 

And out of the blue I got a call saying hi how are you you know everything sweetness and light apologising for having not been in contact with me  but she 'd been busy moving and everything like that 

So and we spoke to I spoke to her yesterday and everything 's lovely

So you know how it was originally

We 're all good friends again  at the moment

Yeah

Yeah

Oh that 's right

Yeah

Yeah

Well it was some imagined slight on her part I 'd imagine

Mm

I mean she realised after that time that I you know when I bumped into her

Well it 's a bit rude though you know that she ignored you deliberately because I know her her looks can be really filthy 

Not personal looks you know attractivewise

but when she glances at you if looks

Mm

If looks can kill

Yes

Yes exactly

Yes

And that does uh come into play 

Well she might be coming to Clare 's party

I don't know

I 've asked her along

I mean she can come with Anna and  Peter

They 're  they 're in Tenerife at the moment  for a week

Yeah

Yeah that 's good

Oh yes that 's right

Oh lucky buggers 

What are they out there 

Just a holiday

Just a last minute holiday really

Well it 's cheap out there at this time of the year

Well I mean Anna hasn't had a holiday at all this year with her mother and everything looking after her mother all the time

Is her mother the one that had the stroke

Yeah

Well she 's in an old people 's home

Oh dear 

Yeah

She is I think

So tell me about this field this field trip of yours then

My field trip

My weekend away

Your dirty weekend so to speak

Well it was

Well not quite no

Actually Rogate 's really nice

That 's where we drove down I drove down to 

Well uh it 's about you just go straight down the A Three

and it 's about uh 

It took me an hour and a quarter to get there down there uh

And  I went down on early Saturday morning

so I left here about nine o'clock or so

It wasn't quite rush hour but it was quite busy for that time in the morning 

Uhm and uhm I had to sta I had to get down there by nine uhm

so I whizzed on down the A Three and went past Guildford

Mm

Mm

So what time did you have to leave

Oh God I don't know

Seven thirty or something

You know

Not that I

It was about I left about uh  uh I left about a quarter to eight or so

But I wanted to be there by nine to check everything out but uh

Because Rogate is just off

It 's near Petersfield 

Yeah all the way down there

But it 's not as far as what 's where 'd where 'd you uh you where you used to live

All the way down there

Uh Godalming

That 's right

Godalming

Not as far as south as Godalming 

Uhm but it 's a very nice part of the world

So I got down there about  uhm yeah nine uhm  parked the car

Arrived at the same time as my lecturer who looked really hung over

He looked so tired

He 'd been to a lecture  the previous night up in London and uh by a very famous biologist uh or and bio biochemist called Oliver Rackham

And uh  so we unpacked our stuff and trooped in

And he 's been there thousands of times before so he he just sort of said the there 's a chart

That 's your room 

Uh go round

and we 'll go to the uh  sec separate wing where the the rooms are 

So we did that

We trooped down to the wing which is actually apart

It 's apart from the main house

But actually it 's it 's a lovely pile

It 's right  it 's on a sort of hill  and you 've got lovely views looking out to the South Downs

But unfortunately both Saturday and Sunday it was really foggy

Well foggy

It was misty

I don't know what it was exactly

Mm

Mm

Mm

Oh no

Did you take the camera with you

Yeah I did but I didn't take any photographs  

I 'm so bad at doing that

I think also it 's because we were 

The the reason for going down there was uhm 

The title of the course was the field trip was Woodland Ecology uhm

And I learnt how to do uh what they call quadrats

Uhm  a quadrat is where you take a section of land

It doesn't matter whether it 's marsh or fen or heathland or bog or sand dunes or what and

I don't know whether you 've ever seen it before but they you measure out

You get nylon rope

and it 's measured out with knots in it

so one metre distance between the knots uhm

and you have a four by two 

You have to make a four by two rectangle on the ground

you pin it down with nails

And you lay it on the ground

It doesn't matter uhm

Then in this case it was in the woodlands

Uhm and then within that square that marked off section uhm that is when you discover how many species are in the uhm are in the woodlands

so that 's what we that 's that 's one part of doing a quadrat uh

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm

Oh that 's a good idea

Because what you do is that

We had there were  twenty-three of us

so there were five or six people to a group

and I think that

Well we did

We had  so we had five quadrats

And uhm the the reason for carrying  carrying this out it really sounds strange you know just pinning pieces of uhm rope down on the ground uh to make a a rectangle or a square

Uhm  the reason for doing that is that the five of us spread out over a little distance in the wood and we each took a patch 

And then you mark down you write down on a list exactly what plants are in it

And it 's amazing

There are so many not weeds I know

I don't call them weeds now

I call them wild flowers because they are 

I don't believe in weeds any more uhm

wild flowers and uh plants

And even in winter time it 's really nice

it 's just like

So many different kinds

Uh Rogate 's really  a tiny little village uhm that 's on  chalk

It 's on the chalk downs really so it was uhm

Saturday and Sunday we visited a wood in the morning which was an oak wood with uhm uhm smaller trees mixed in

And then then in the afternoon we did uh another oak wood but it was dominated more by fir trees pines and things like that

And then on Sunday uh we did a third wood in the morning which was different

You know you I used to think that all you know you think English woodland 's all the same

it 's just a wood big deal and uh

But it 's not

There are apparently uh  the National uh Vegetation there 's a there 's a system called the N V C which is National veg Vegetation Classification 

Uhm it 's a system that 's been set up by biologists and ecologists and everything like that

And they figured out that basically in England in the British Isles there are twenty-three different types of woodland 

So uhm so then that means like you get your get your beech woods and your oak woods

but within the beech and oak woods there are different kinds

You know you have a beech wood that might be all beeches and it might be on limestone and it might be on chalk or it could be on flint or gravel soil soil

Uhm  so really we over the Sun the Saturday and Sunday we investigated these four

They they were different but they weren't so different uhm

And the way we found that out was by cross-sectioning uhm the type of plants that were growing in each of the woods 

And there are some

Uh have you seen dog 's mercury

D' you know what dog 's mercury is like

Yeah

That little plant that grows

doesn't matter what the soil conditions are whether it 's very acidic or chalk or whatever

Mm

Mm  yes  mm

Yeah

Wow

Oh really mm

Yeah

It grows in anything

Grows in anything

Yeah

Same with ivy and holly as well

Yeah

I won't bother to pronounce the Latin names because I 'm only just uh starting to  to learn them

Michelle on Sunday was sort of pronouncing some of the Latin names

Yes 

Oh you have to go and enter a competition about that

Oh look

there 's a  a betula betula pendulosa or something 

This week she 's doing uh she 's into doing dairy and pigs  so if she does come tonight she 'll probably be stinking of pigs

Oh my God 

Oh charming

 I like pigs though

very nice 

You ought to see what I got you for your Christmas present 

That 's nice 

 I suddenly saw this thing  this article 

So I thought aha

Yeah

Oh mm mm

Oh that 's nice 

Good right pigs pigs and

Pigs and cats  and dogs

Mm

Just because you 're tolerant doesn't mean you have to like it to put up with it but you don't necessarily have to

Do you think it just means that they 're very blah people then 

 Well yes 

I mean it 's stumped me

I used to I used to sit there

Maybe they are people that have just never thought about it

Maybe they are just sort of

Some people are just completely inarticulate

And there was one guy very very uhm  uh  hate to say it like working class

Ho ho

I 'll tell you a funny story about working class later 

But when I no but listen when I asked him to describe somebody to describe a mate of his and to describe someone he liked and someone he didn't like he broke out in a sweat 

Seriously

He was sitting there and he was going uh  uh caring and he was struggling to find the words friendly

And it was like I 'd s it was like I 'd sat him under a

it was like some kind of  test

He obviously felt he was being tested in some way

Oh and that 's right and then we got to the bit

Is your student the same student

No no no

This was a guy at uhm the drama

Uh a parent o of one of the kids that Emily does her drama class with 

And the funny thing was and then then his wife was is obviously his wife or his girlfriend was sitting there

and I asked him t I said and and think of a woman you like any female you like some preferably someone who is not listening  so that he didn't have to describe the woman who was sitting there

And the thought of being asked to think of a woman that he liked excluding his wife 

he was sweating

He was obviously afraid of mentioning some girlfriend and offending the wife

So eventually I had to help the poor guy out

I said well you know a member of your family for example 

He was it was it was

And and some people just just find it very difficult

And people 's choice of people 's choice of adjectives  in describing people

I mean you can see the importance of a good vocabulary 

Uhm

Well yes yes

Well you don't have a problem with that

artistic people don't

but people that have been in involved in sciences or  or a thing like that they just don't have creative minds

My sister for instance

She she just doesn't have any kind of a creative mind at all

And anything that 's just not black and white facts you know scientific facts or mathematic facts she can't get her head round it at all

Yes

But people do it all the time

You sit there you sit there in a canteen wherever you are and you sit and you listen and the conversation next to you someone 's saying he 's really boring blah blah blah he 's really materialistic

This is what we do all the time

We sit and describe other people

And I mean when people got stuck I 'd just say look just listen you imagine you 're in a pub and I 've said to you what 's he like  and then just describe them

He 's this and this

I think people aren't used to describing peoples 's personalities

No no no

It was but anyway all I 'm saying is it 's been a very interesting way of meeting people and I wished that really that I 'd that I 'd used people in their thirties

But they 'd have been more difficult

Because for examp example when I started off when I was doing like my preliminary questionnaires I rang Heather  Daniel and I asked her  and

and me I c cold you know

I bluffed myself

I mean I 'll show it to you later

But I I I got my ones the ones I chose

Mm

Who did you choose to describe 

Uhm 

Who didn't you like

Hold on

I 'll read you the thing and then you can tell me if you recognise them

Hold on

Not necessarily very well though

You don't know this person very well

Anyway  female I like 

Wise intuitive funny perceptive intelligent caring well-read patient clever artistic warm honest brave self-aware allowing 

Heather Daniels

Heather Daniel

Yeah

Female I don't like

You don't know this woman 

Narrow-minded petty dictatorial anxious stupid selfish egotistical unanalytical whingeing sentimental sickly 

Disgusting woman

Uh male I like

Who 's that then 

Well she 's called Lynn

Lynn Radnage

You don't know her

Uhm male I like

Honest clever wise funny perceptive intuitive loving

Ooh I can't guess

Interested  broadminded patient gentle faithful courageous self-aware allowing honest

Doesn't begin with R does it and end in Angor

No

Oh 

I was going to question it if so

No

Honest clever

No

These are all entirely true

Wise funny perceptive intuitive loving interested

Oh

Mike

Broadminded



Patient gentle faithful courageous self-aware of feelings allowing

That 's true

Really

I was actually thinking of Julie for the first one but then  for some reason I didn't

Mm

Uhm 

Male I don't like

God I can't remember who this is now

Oh read it to me

Stupid  uncaring

Oh yes I remember

Uncaring uninterested selfish arrogant petty  narrow-minded cold unaffectionate unaware of feelings unallowing unanalytical out of touch with himself 

Hah

I don't think you 'd be quite that strong about David Bateson

No no

This is the man I chose to marry

Oh

Stupid uncaring uninterested

There 's two kinds of people there 's two kinds of people in the world

I mean one interesting category is the interested uninterested category

Like there are the kind of people that are interested in other people  and there are the kind of people that are uninterested in other people 

Uhm so that 's an interesting interesting one

Anyway here 's Heather 's

Woman 

Warm open thoughtful

amazing sense of humour 

Uhm woman she likes

Woman she doesn't like

Tight clipped anxious 

Central quality

tight

A man you don't like

Distant uninvolved quiet unattractive-looking out of touch with his body not sexy 

Man you like

Involved interested

sense of humour

warm open intelligent 

Central quality

involved

Yes

But she means involved with other people you know prepared to take an interest in  

So so anyway so all I was saying originally  is that it 's very interesting and the number of people that that sh that described themselves 

Mm

Yeah

Involved

Mm

Really

Yeah

I mean for example there was one girl who I met at U who I interviewed at U C L

there 's the most striking example of it who was

she was black  really beautiful

She had her hair kind of  down in a kind of I don't know net

You know hardly any hair and close-cropped to her head  absolutely perfect features  and very thin and elegant

And the first thing I said

can you describe a woman she like she likes  and the qualities about her

And the first thing she said was feline 

Mm

She liked

She liked

A woman that she liked

The first thing she said was feline

She was the most feline person I 'd seen all year 

You know

And people do people do tend to describe themselves

and also  if people have a very limited vocabulary which a lot of people do  it 's interesting looking at them and seeing  in what ways it 's limited 

You know what particular traits they they they get stuck in 

I mean like I said to quote the example again of of Debbie who said  when describing both a woman she didn't like and a man she didn't like the very first quality she didn't like was uhm weak 

She said that they were both weak  so I said

so I pointed that out to her rather naughtily

I said what do you mean by weak Debbie 

You know

And jealous is an interesting one

A lot of people describe people as jealous 

Oh he 's jealous 

I think what do they mean

Well yes

That 's right

That 's right

That 's what is interesting

How can you describe someone else as jealous

I mean I suppose they 're they 're describing that they think the person 's jealous but it 's 

Mm

Mm

How can they tell

I suppose they just mean they 're behaving in a way that they would if they were jealous

Particularly sort of peevish sort of way really

Yeah yeah

But you can't you can't you can't say somebody 's jealous or not

And then there are the really bland ones that I think oh come on

You know friendly  helpful

Is this the guy that was breaking out into a cold sweat

Well no there 's lots of people

I mean you 'd be amazed

Eh the other thing I suppose to learn about it is how much simple qualities like friendly and helpful matter to people 

Uhm  polite is always a bit of a strange one 

No

Why do you like someone

Why do you like this person 

Oh she 's polite

First quality they like about a friend of theirs is they 're polite

I mean 

That that foxes me

Bitchy is very common

 Yes it is quite

Mm

Yes

I can imagine

Bitchy

Both women on women women on men men on women men on 

a lot of men describe women as bitchy  and and some some women describe men as bitchy which is interesting 

Uhm

Well I think they are

Everybody is occasionally but 

But i it 's just you know the the the qualities that spring to mind

Outgoing

Look

See on this page

Outgoing outgoing outgoing

first quality 

That 's uhm  blinkered I think is a nice word if you 're describing someone that you don't like

Yes

You know blinkered only able to see their own point of view

A lot of people struggled with trying to find a lot of people couldn't think of the wo word

I mean that after I 'd done this for a hundredth I know exactly the words people are trying to find

but I 'm trying not to prompt them

They say to me what 's the word for someone who only sees their own point of view or can't see other people 's point of view and  

Uhm so that 's quite 

Honesty

Yes

Honesty is appreciated a lot

I 'm pleased to say  uhm

All black females seem to want people to be bubbly 

Mm

Really

Practically all black females start their description of things they like with bubbly

And some people in their descriptions of of of people that they don't like

I mean they 're just totally un unin 

There 's one I was going to show you because it it made my hair stand on end 

It 's a bit scary this  if I can find it 

No

Can't find it

But uhm  some people when describing people they don't like they just come out with this  kind of chain a bit like mine I suppose  chain of venom 

Kind of frightening

Really

Yeah yeah yeah

So what what kind of words did they use

Uhm I 'm just trying to find it

and I can't put my finger on it because of course they 're all anonymous

so I 

Well I think

I mean  a user and uh 

But you would

If somebody has just done something to you that you don't like then you would

If somebody if when you asked me to describe a man that I didn't like I particularly didn't use Billy because I I I could have come out with a chain of venom a page long

But that wasn't the idea really because under normal circumstances I like him

But those people have probably had j something awful done to them  the week before or something

Yeah

No

Maybe 

Scheming 

I mean that that intrigues me

I never think of anybody as scheming

I mean maybe I 'm naive 

Scheming manipulative

a liar

But I

But yes I 'd I 'd describe manipulative people as manipulative 

I mean because what you what you what you get when you when you do this is you think  here are all these people describing other people as  liars manipulative  untruthful insincere  snivelling self-satisfied uhm  all these

all these

I mean like  malicious

You think well these are these are people that other people are describing as warm loving friendly

You know I mean I didn't seem

Uh here I am talking to all the

Because I 'm asking people their own point of view  I 'm obviously  I mean in a sense it 's a nice position to be in because I 'm asking everybody to express what they think so they like me because they think oh here 's kind of subconsciously they think here 's someone who 's prepared to listen to what I think  so 

Anyway 

There 's too much of me talking 

I 'm talking too much

Mm

These are peanutty 

There you go 

It 's a very nice shirt by the way well

It 's a very old shirt

It 's very nice

Thank you 

What shit I 'm writing 

Are we supposed to be talking constructively

You 're supposed to be conversing

Well I couldn't care less what the hell we talk about

Dani come on you 're not doing anything start talking yeah 

Well then you 'll have to give me some sort of topic to talk about

Oh for God 's sake woman

How was your day 





It was OK

How was yours

Oh it was all right 

Oh my god I went to have dinner with this girl called Kate who 's on my course

I mean she 's going to be the next Margaret Thatcher without  without a doubt



Oh god

She 's British Canadian and she was just going on about how she 'll have no problem getting a job

no problem

And she knew an ex-professor because she did some M S C in shipping trade and finance whatever and she 's there saying she 's going to get no problem ah

She was making me sick

and she was going to use her contacts here there and everywhere

and it 's like oh Kate shut up 

Silly girl 

No no

She sounds quite sensible actually

Oh Dani

You pretend

You try so hard at being this  like  oh

Must be the Jewish in you 

Being what

Being what

This kind of a mercenary person 

Maybe I am 

Well you 've missed the yuppie boat 

Oh typical bloody yuppie 

That 's just so pass&eacute; in the nineties 

Can I count this as viewing banking as providing 

Well

not much is being said here is it 



Come on woman

Say something 

I can never think of anything to say when I 'm being being under stress

I mean come on 

Never usually say much anyway

You talk too much 

So how was baby-sitting 

I can't stand baby-sitting 

Baby-sitting is just the pits honestly 

The child cried constantly

She wouldn't go to sleep she wouldn't eat she wouldn't uch she wouldn't do anything 

She just crawled around the whole time being totally destructive pulling things off tables and just really  annoying me really 

Is that why you came back in such a bad mood 

Partly

I also had the car

What you So I 'm sorry what did exactly happen with the car

Well it wouldn't start 

See

I couldn't get it started on the Saturday night because I was going to come back on Sunday 

and so I had to uh well Elizabeth my cousin eh phoned someone who  is good with cars

and he came down on Monday morning at half six and got it started for me 

And I didn't have my A A card which is why I was really stuck  because I 'd left it

Aha 

Why else was I in a bad mood

Oh yes

I stood on a pair of scales at my cousin 's

Oh you said you put on a stone and a half

But honestly you don't look any fatter 

Thanks Moses thanks a lot

Well I mean you don't

If you look any fatter it might you know 

 If you 're a stone and a half it must make some difference 

I mean if I can see a difference god

Do you think she has put on weight

I don't think she has no 

But I mean I really don't darling 

What else was I in a bad mood about

Oh yes I 've got a spot  on my nose 

It 's like being back as a teenager

Oh no 

Actually it 's really funny there 's all these because one of the

on the Sunday they had this party in the house and it was all the school kids  because my cousin 's a schoolmaster and they had this party and they put some cider in the punch 

And my cousin left the punch through in the next door

and I 'm going

oh

they 're going to spike it

they 're going to spike it

and he 's going

it was just so funny

They 're so sweet

They came through afterwards

They all sat down and went hallo Miss Gersh how are you doing 

Oh no

Who was this

All the students All the pupils

What 's that 

What is that card Laura 

I 've been trying

Uh that 's it

I 've been trying to figure

I 've left it and I 've looked at it every day for the past week going what is this card 

Listen

can't we do this at some other time 

This is fine 

Are you sure

It 's just that I don't really I mean  I 'm not really concentrating actually

It doesn't matter

That 's the whole point

No

I mean on my bloody work  on this that I 'm doing

 So how many have you done altogether

This is my second one 

Second one

And so you 're not just copying the first one

A little bit

You have to change them 

Well only the career choice bit

No

Look Dani

you don't know what you 're speaking about

so really let me tell you 

Moses Moses believe me

I spent two years solidly applying

Yeah yeah yeah

Standard applications

Yeah yeah OK

Good-o good-o 

Really

Honestly

I mean you 're not exactly world 's expert

You 've only filled in two

I know

It 's the first time I 've ever filled these bloody things out

But you have to

Just different banks different corporate culture

You have to change 

Which is why you send one standard C V to all ba all places

Yeah

But that 's why your cover letter 's so important Dani 

So have you got a C V written yet 

I just have to change my old one and add some things you see

But what you 'll have to do to mine Mine 's on two pages at the moment

but what you 'll have to do is shrink it down to just one page

so I have to change a few things around get rid of a few things

you know 

What

Do you mean one page as in back and front or just one

A four

No just one side 

Oh blimey 

Well I can do it in very small writing if you want

Well I 

Can't you shrink it or something  on your computer

Is it Geneva or something

Well that 's what I mean

I can do the whole lot in very small writing 

Oh well I 'll show you how it 's supposed to be 

Well that would help if you do want it done by the end of term

I would like it done on Wednesday if possible 

Mm

Please

Well if you give me it tomorrow I might be able to do some tomorrow morning before I go to the rugby

I can only do an hour though

That would be excellent

Well the thing is if we 're going out now

There 's no problem

We 'll do it Wednesday or Thursday possibly 

Mm yeah

Could do

Mm is that all right for you

Mm any day 

Except tomorrow 

Actually what

Yeah that 'd be fine 

So have you sent any forms away yet

No 

Have you not finished any of the application forms you were doing

No 

So when 's the closing dates for most of them

Oh they all vary 

Have all the evenings and stuff finished now

I really don't know

I haven't been to any of them

I went to that first one and that was it 

 And then you decided they were a load of rubbish and decided not to go again yes

Exactly 

So you 're going tonight then yeah

I 'm thinking about it uh 

Have you got any white wine

Any what

White wine

Do we have to take a bottle of wine

Yeah

A cheap bottle

Oh god 

Have you got any 

Oh I 'll have to stop by the  off-licence

Mm 

So you 're thinking of cycling

Don't mind 

Oh god

I was going to say

why don't you talk to Laura

but there 's not much point in that is there  

Well you did say you 'd do it 

Oh well I did

I know

I know I did Dani

You 're quite right  

Uh 

So is it Cheeseman and Hutton you 're applying to

No

City Bank

Oh 

Where 's it based

New York 

Obviously it 's based here in London but  its main corporate head offices are in New York 

Are you applying to the London branch

 Of course 

Well you might be applying to the New York one

No

Silly girl

Why 

Oh Dani really 

No

Why

Because if you 're in London you apply to their operations in London don't you  you stupid little girl

Well you might want to emigrate

Yeah

Then you emigrate and then apply there 

Silly girl 

Thanks

God you really know how to put someone down don't you

Oh let 's not get touchy touchy  

Very difficult Moses when you 're around 

So I hear  

I believe I 'm a bit of a nightmare then 

So how long have we 

Uhm

How long have we been speaking

I don't know

I wish it was over now

Sorry 

What did she say

I don't know 

What 's C stroke C

City Corps and City Bank 

I mean how much do we have to

How much longer do we seriously have to talk for 

Well I presume it 's until the tape runs out

No

It 's only for fifteen minutes

Well there 's only about fifteen minutes left on the tape

I 'm trying so hard to concentrate on this

Well why don't you give up for five minutes 

I mean I presume it 's until Laura comes back down

Oh what a nightmare 

Come on get worked up

It 'd make it a lot more fun 

Worked up about what 

About me 

About you right  

I can't get worked up 

I need to think about this 

 There 's no point 

So how many times have you written that one out now 

Mose

Dani look

I 'm trying to do this 

Yes I know

And I 'm trying to hold a fifteen minute conversation

If I didn't answer I know

If I didn't answer you it 's like give me a chance

I will answer you in a minute

Training

is it one N or two

One

Are you sure 

You 're not

Oh your spelling is 

Look it up in a dictionary

I wouldn't trust 

or Laura 's 

Oh Lau Laura 's spelling is awful



It is 

It bloody

Oh I 've got

Remind me to tell her that actually 

So embarrassing with my supervisor

Why

What bloody linguistics

She can't even spell

 That 's not what linguistics is about

It 's about talking not spelling

Yes

But I 'm sure if you 're communicating 

The battery might be going in the  thing but it doesn't matter because 

Oh this thing

So have you got another replacement battery

or is it

Uh no

But the little tape recorder itself records so

Oh right

Yeah

It 's not a problem 

So what was the date 

The ninth

The date

Yeah the ninth

It 's so near Christmas it 's unbelievable

I know I s started feeling Christmassy today for the first time

I haven't not yet

I 'm I haven't even bought my presents or or or cards or anything 

It 's terrible 

Oh I 've got all mine

I have to say that I have done all mine

I 'm going to

I 'm going to have to get round to it

I 'm going to have to go this Saturday

I 'm going to have to say to myself Christmas shopping on Friday

Maybe I 'll take the afternoon off 

I can't take Friday afternoon off

Maybe Thursday I could take off 

Depends when my supervisor 's busy  because he checks up on me now 

Really

Oh god

I went for lunch with my supervisor on Sunday

She had l lunch for uhm  all her P h D students

It was really nice

That was nice

We had duck  and uh

Well actually I thought it was pork throughout most of the meal

and then she said

oh I 've left the

watch the cats because I 've left the bits of duck 

and oh

yeah

duck

I hadn't even thought about it you know  but it was really good 

Oh

Right

Uh uh

Uh did

Was she cooking it yeah

Yeah and her husband

Oh well super 

And uh  we had courgettes with feta cheese in 

Wow

That sounds gorgeous

Oh we must try it

It was so good

Grilled

Uhm

Uh it was so good

And we should have that with our Christmas dinner 

Yeah as a starter

And then walnut tart 

Home made walnut tart

It was fantastic

And I 'd just about been on my best behaviour the whole time but I gave in on the walnut tart front  and had seconds  with whipped cream

Oh wow



Oh 

Ecstasy 

Yeah

No I was  really good this weekend but my Aunt 's Irish well my au my cousin 's Irish 

She gave me sort of like a dinner you know when I was baby-sitting with sort of like half a ton of potatoes and  half a ton more of potatoes 

Potatoes are OK in moderation but

Where did they go off to

It was her birthday

They went off to a restaurant for a meal

Oh that 's nice

Yeah

So I was left with the baby

How old is it 

Who

Baby

Eight months 

It 's just crawling

Is it cute 

It 's very cute

It 's got a grin that 's sort of like up to here I mean

It says mmm like this 

And they wanted to photograph it for some baby magazines

not my cousin 's

But uhm they took it to a shop  you know to get some baby clothes and so on

and the woman in the shop said

oh

Oh yes

So it does

Laura Frances Tollfree

I had to find something out when I was talking with Moses

I was getting bored

What 's your middle name

Robin

Oh yes

That 's Vicky 's Dad 's name 

Oh 

Yeah I know it was my granny 's choice  so my initials were D R  because she wants me to be a doctor

She wanted me to be a medical doctor

Well you are going to be a doctor

Yeah

I put my foot down at being a medic so this is a compromise  

Well she 's an old battleaxe honestly

I hope you never have the pleasure of meeting her 

Yeah

Yeah really

Oh that reminds me

Jim

I must write that message 

Little Jimmy your gran phoned 

Where did I leave my phonecard 

Uhm you brought it up did you not with a bit of paper

Uh there it is 

I haven't seen Jim for ages

No

He 's  I don't think he 's in tonight 

Sorry

He 's not in tonight I don't think

Is he going to the party

Don't think so

No 

Oh 

Hope this is good

Been looking forward to it all weekend

Mm 

I must remember to put that away

You don't happen to be going to Jesus College in the next few days do you

I don't even know where Jesus College is

Jesus

That 's the nearest college to here 

Well anyway that defeats the object

No

I 've got to get a message to my student 's direc director of studies

Oh piece of black pudding in the ground

look at that 

Black pudding

Yes



Uh uh 

That 's Scottish

Yeah 

Oh come on chaps

God it 's twenty past ten

We 've got to go soon 

Do you want just to get phone a taxi or something and just go   or cycle in 

Yeah

Maybe we should do

Well she said uhm the phone message said they 'd be back in twenty minutes  and that was some time ago 

Uhm maybe they 're meeting us there

I don't know

Well actually she said make your way to the Bengal if if you want

Shall we

We could do that 

Oh I would imagine she would have left by now if she said twenty minutes

You would have thought so

Uhm

Vicky 's not awfully good on time 

We should maybe just leave a message here saying head over 

She won't bother coming then though 

Do you think

No 

You see the thing is where is the Bengal anyway

Is that the one in the Grafton

Across the Grafton Centre

Maybe we should head there and then just head for the taxi queue or just walk in from there  without taking our bikes in case we meet her 

Yeah

She 's got Vanessa with her 

Is Vanessa coming as well

To my knowledge yes 

Oh god god we 've got to get some white wine

Yeah

I 'd forgotten all about that

What time do the off-licences close 

I don't know

Could be too late 

Oh sods 

We haven't got any in store have we 

No

I 've got a few cans

Uhm I think I 've got one can 

Oh that 's a bit of a bummer

Uhm 

Because I usually have some but  I was kind of wiped out last weekend

Yeah 

Did you D' you order a ball photo 

Ball photo

Not ball

Woodville Feast

Yeah 

Unframed



But crested

Oh that 's nice

Well what the hell eh 

Mm

You didn't 

No 

Thought I 'd better pay my chit bill off before I did any big spending 

I paid it off in one large lump 

How much was it for 

Sixty-four quid

God 

How on earth did you

We 've covered this ground before 

Have we

Yeah 

I was saying the other day how on earth did you get it to be so big 

Yeah

I 've no idea 

I meant to ask them to have a look at them the chits

I was going to say

Are you sure someone hasn't been using your name 

Well I did think about it 

I mean I had  three Woodville Feasts which was three times about fifteen which is what forty-five 

Bit more than that

One of them came to about eighteen  because it was eight nine and nine 

But that 's the Woodville one was forty-five about forty-five because the tickets were fourteen sixteen sixteenish

Oh god yes

And then I had

That reminds us

Tom hasn't paid us yet

No he has not 

And then I had the the other one the Saint Andrew 's which was about what  were they about seven seven eight

No

The Saint Andrew 's was quite a lot 

No

It wasn't

Yeah because it was more than Guest night

Andrew 's was nine pound ten  for guests and eight pounds something for normals

Oh I didn't pay the Woodville Feast by chit did I

I 've no idea

That 's right

it was nine nine and ten for the Saint Andrew 's which was 

That was about thirty  and then there was the guest night

That was the other one

What was the Guest

Was it about six seven seven

It was about seven and then eight for a guest maybe

So that was another what three sevens twenty-one

About twenty-four and thirty is fifty-four 

And then I paid the Christmas dinner on it as well

that was three times 

Was the Christmas five

About five yeah

was it  fifteen

and fifty-four is 

No that can't be right

To twenty forty

Oh sorry forty-four

Fifteen and forty-four

About a fiver yeah

And then you bought some drinks from the bar maybe

About fifty-six

I bought one bottle of wine which would be about another fiver

That would take it just above sixty 

So it w it would be right

Mm

Yeah

Oh OK

But I I didn't think so

Uhm also what they could 've done is added the taxi on  because I had a taxi home one night on my own 

That 's supposed to be free though 

I don't know because they got me to sign fill in a chit

Yeah

You sign it

It 's supposed to be free 

Well I didn't know for sure if it was free or not

I mean I don't know if the guy added it on or not 

Maybe there 's two

Mm

I don't know 

I mean it 's only fair if you do pay for it really

Mm

Yeah

I didn't mind paying

No quite 

I think three quid there and three quid back  if you 're desperate

or three quid between three of you

Mm

Then it 's not bad

I 'm going to get a taxi to the station tomorrow I 've decided

Got all that to take and more

Yeah

I mean it 's definitely worth it

It 's 

Yeah 

I mean there 's so many presents to take

I 've left some at Eleanor 's for when Mum comes up

Aha 

But I mean 

And I 've got so many events to go to

I mean  I know that sounds a bit odd but I mean I 've got a few

And they 're different things

One 's a dinner one 's a party  so I 've tried to get something

Mm

I 'm just wearing leggings and a big baggy

You know

my big green V neck jumper and velvet glittery leggings

well not glittery but velvet coloured leggings 

But I mean it  you know once you 've got everything 

Yeah that 's nice uhm

Mm

So are you away all weekend as well

Yeah

Y Yeah I 'm coming back on Sunday

Well  in fact she 's prob

Are she and Ben still an item

No no

They 're fine

She 's probably coming tonight uhm 

Well yes

But when she says she 's probably coming it doesn't mean to say she is

so 

Uhm 

She 's probably already there

 she 'll probably be there before we are

I was going to say

if she goes in and finds I 'm not there well it wouldn't put her off

but 

Mm mm

I went to the King 's mingle on

Oh I told you all that yeah

Mm 

That was quite good though 

So I 'm not looking forward to this rugby match 

Yeah yeah

 In the morning oh horrible 

You going up on coach

Uhm

Can't fit me in as well can you 

Oh actually 

Actually we probably could

Laura 's doing P H D in Linguistics

and she 's basing it on real data

so she turns this thing on 

It 's not fair you know nobody knows 

So she

The other day she did it and disappeared to use the phone

and we spent the whole half hour slagging her off 

She hasn't listened to the tape yet 

The best one she 's got Jim and Moses reading aloud  

Reading poetry

Reading poetry 

 and laughing

and Jim laughing the whole way through

and Moses going

oh

I thought that was going really well you idiot  

What was Moses doing going off in them jeans

Oo

I don't know

Moses is being a bit of a dark horse recently

Is he

You 've met Moses haven't you Vicky

He 's He 's gone a bit sort of quiet  which is unusual for Moses 

I 'm not surprised

Is it since he threw himself at that girl



Katja

She 's going out with somebody else now 

Yes

Yes

He looked all sad 

He uhm  He seemed to think he 'd been throwing himself at her you know declaring his feelings

And he when she used to come into a room he used to  not even speak to her

Ignore her

He ignored her

And that was throwing himself at her

It 's all a bit strange

And then he went up to her and said what else do you want me to do

I 've been throwing myself at you

And she said who are you  

Where have you sprung from 

My room is such a pit I can't believe it

Cor

'T is isn't it

What a pit

I keep tidying it up

I keep looking expecting to see all the people I know 

They uhm  There 's quite a funny one 

She 's starting again

You 're going behind me again

Sorry

God

Whenever I come into this room

We 're in the wrong place

Vicky always wants to get go into the cupboard behind me

Yeah

It 's a little fetish I 've got   getting into the cupboard 

Awkward child

Yeah 

Where is Tom Pitts

Oh that 's not the funniest one  

Mm

But there 's In my photograph I 've got

It 's quite likely I 've got lots of people this year  than there were last



Really

Yeah

I 've got the other the other one to that one Vicky and Tom Pitts has got his profile

Oh have you

Profile here

Very short skirt on if you don't mind me saying

With all my hair on one side of my head

Oh God I 've got an essay to write

That reminds me so much of 

So have I

Have you

Till when

Well it 's got to be handed in a week on Monday and I 've been doing it for about three weeks now

You just  and do it now then

God

Ours is supposed to be about s sensory

She 's doing a P G C E

Yes

Pathetic

Sorry

but that 's all I know about it really

Do we actually see what we think we see

or are we just seeing three-or-four-words

Oh no



Seeing

How do we know what other people see 's the same as what we see

Who cares

That 's what it boils down to

Who cares

Good

Ours are supposed to be a thousand words not two words

Ours are supposed to be three 

Three words

Three thousand

They don't know if it would have been good otherwise

Yeah

Three thousand

How much have you got to write

I 've done about to two

Just consolidate now

I mean I 've got all the notes

It 's just a question of putting them in order but I just can't be bothered

I know

It is physically impossible to force myself to work sometimes

Yeah

Quite impossible 

I felt so ill this morning

I just sit reading it

and my mind just sort of

Yeah

So how 's the work go going

Finally finished the week before

Yeah

Something like that

I thought that was the case

But you have half term 

Two reading days

Oh 

Did you have half term

So what are you doing with your time now

Uhm  I just

cos this week I was gonna going to like wind everything up

you know

so I 've just thought I 'd have an extra few days just to  go to Sainsbury 's  do my room 

And then next weekend I 'm going down to London for a few days 

I think

And uhm  And then Mum 's coming

After all

We 're having not the cottage that we had before but one nearby which is really nice

So that 'll be nice

When 's your Mum coming

She 's coming Well I 'm a bit confused but I think she 's coming next weekend

Really

And the reason why I thought you might be Dad was because he is probably in England as we speak

Is he

Yes 

And I thought that would be just 

You were like really worried on the phone 

I thought oh no

Cos I heard this voice say

hello

and it 's distorted and I thought

and then there was a man 's voice

and I thought

it 's Dad and Debbie

They 've drove driven straight here

Dad and Debbie

It 's like they 've been casted

Dad and Debbie 

So I had 

And I thought

I couldn't even focus my mind on what I wanted to buy

Yeah

No

Oh I remember passing out in Sainsbury 's once

It 's just so tense  standing in the queue 

I think we 're all coming coming down with it

That 's exactly

Not Soap

Yes

It is but

No

It looks like him you know the father

It does

The hair 's exactly the same

Yeah

Maybe he was younger then 

God it is him

Maybe he is just older

He 's more serious as well

Yeah 

Oh she 's not back on the phone again

If if girls have uhm I 'm going to show my ignorance in front of the tape here

If girls have black eyebrows but really blond hair is there something odd there

does that

I think some guys do as well

Oh it it 's not it doesn't mean they 've dyed it then does it 

I think they can have but I 'm not sure

I think they 're just darker

the hair 's just dark

It may mean their hair is dyed actually 

Yeah

Their hair 's probably dyed

Mm

Yeah probably

Yes

Fake blond

Very Los Angeles 

Keep talking you idiot  

 I can't think of anything to say now Moses

Well it 's a bit stupid thing to be concerned about what you 're watching

your taste in T V programmes

Oh look  the midget hero hunk 

That 's why I thought I 'd watch it you see

He 's our hero

Three people

Really

Laura 's amazing

When she gets on that phone she just does not get off

I know

I 've never heard anybody spend so much time on the phone

And such useless drivel most of the time

 I feel very sorry for the person talking to her

Yeah really  

It looks a good vehicle yeah

It does

Very handy

I think I think it 's Japanese though more than it does

It 's a very handy vehicle

A Land Rover would 've done far better

Well it 's a bit more than a Land Rover

It 's kind of a cross between 

No no

But a Land Rover adapted would 've been brilliant

Yeah Yeah

Would 've been far more the part

Oh is it over

No

Oh what a shame

It 's funny that is 

Has it got a an engine in it though 

Ha ha

You see I love crap as well

 I love good old Friday night movies as well horrors

Oh oh yes

And then I went back to Portugal when I was ten years old and then came back when I was thirteen or fourteen fifteen

Right

And you 've been living in London ever since

You 've never lived anywhere else in England or elsewhere

Yeah

No thank heavens

And yourself

Oh myself

Good Jew from Mill Hill

Yeah

Good Jew from Mill Hill

You what

Bit more Anglicized than most

Mm 

I 'm not saying that 's good 

But have you seen this advert

No

Devastating effect though obviously

Under my armpits 

Keep talking with me

Oh

It 's quite cheap as well which is 

Very cheap 

I 've got my thesis forum on  Monday

What 's that

A thing like you had when you 've got to talk for ten minutes about what it

 was disastrous

He said it didn't go so bad but he just said it was just very brief and everyone else was very brief

Yeah

But his was a complete  

Why

I mean I don't mind doing work

Why

Did they criticise his

Eh

Did they criticise his proposal

No

Not at all

But he never I he never mean he just doesn't make any effort to talk to anybody there

That 's funny

He really does not

I don't think he knows one person on that course to speak to

D' you know o on a course of eighty-three people he does not know

He does not

And I 'm not exaggerating

He doesn't seem to care though does he which isn't such a bad thing

  to one person on that course

Mm

Uh three-or-four-words

He 's a good bloke though

I can't understand it

Well precisely

He does seem to be a good laugh once he 's here in the house

Yeah

And even when you go out with him

Mm 

Why 

I said did you hear my joke

Do you want to hear my joke

Oh God no

Come on 

Why does it take ten women with P M T to change a light bulb

I don't know

Because it just does 

Get over

Anyway do you want to hear mine

Think about it

OK

Uhm Fergie and Diana

Yeah

They 're on their way to a Palace uhm reception

And there 's just the two of them and they have to stop because there 's these two highway robbers there  thieves whatever

And they get out the car and one of the thieves goes to the Queen can we have all your money

Anyway the Queen goes  you know I 'm royalty

I don't carry money

My handbag 's empty

I don't need to

I don't have to

And that 's that

And then they turn round to Diana

and they say

they

but you know where are all your jewels

and she says you know I don't have any

they 're all state property

You know sovereign state

All that 

And she says to the thieves come on take the Land Rover and leave oh Blind Date and leave them behind

And Diana goes to the Queen well what happened to those five hundred pounds you  before we left

And the Queen goes I hid them in my pants 

And the Queen goes but where are the jewels that you were wearing

Oh well I 've sold them too and I 've hidden that in my pants

And the Queen goes well shame Fergie wasn't here

otherwise we could have hidden the Land Rover  

Yes

Quite funny

I think it 's very good

I don't you got it

What do you mean because I didn't

Of course I bloody well got it 

Wasn't as sophisticated as my joke

Oh no of course not

But uhm one finds it so hard to be sophisticated with you generally

Really 

Can we stop now

I don't know

I feel very tired

Laura can we turn this off now 

You see I don't think that three-or-four-words

I think we 've got at least another five minutes to go

OK

Oh let 's see who the hunks are

Nobody 

There was a Cambridge student on a couple of weeks ago

Was there really

Apparently the archetypal tweed suit

Oh you know very pompous 

Oh

Oh don't you know

love 

Bit like a fish isn't he 

He 's got a face like a fish

Mm 

I can't stand Cilla Black

Oh she 's lovely you idiot

Oh she 's not lovely at all

She is nice 

I met her exact lookalike

Well I met her so

In hospital

Oh did you

Her exact lookalike

Not as good as meeting someone who looks just like her 

And he thinks he 's so cool doesn't he 

Oh he 's a window cleaner

How nice for you 

What 's wrong with that

Nothing

Nothing wrong with a career as a window cleaner

Really

That 's what I 'll end up doing

Yeah

He saves her life

Yeah

Really 

Mm 

Who would your lady in a bubble bath be

I don't know 

I mean I would be tempted to say Kim Basinger

Just can't think of anybody else 

I don't know

Who would yours be

Mm

Uhm 

Uhm

Oh my God

Weasel features 

What did he say

With women I 'm going to close my eyes and try and pick one

I never

I 've always wanted

I didn't hear 

What did he say

It was obviously very funny 

I know

But they 're all made up beforehand aren't they

No

Not with Cilla I don't think

You don't think so 

Hurray

I like Nottingham 

I think he 's going to go for it as well 

Poor Nottingham 

Look

Turn it off

I 've had enough of that shit 

She 's 

Robin Hood Robin Hood riding through the glen

Robin Hood Robin Hood and his merry men

We 're supposed to be looking at accents not singing ability

There are accents in singing 

I beg your pardon

There are accents in singing

I 'm sure there are

Turn it off

So why don't you have my one cos I think I might nip off shortly

Are you sure

Mm

Yes 

Mmm right amount

Well I can always get the la the the later one

No

That 's fine really

Yes thank you 

Oh dear

Excuse me

I was just thinking about how overdressed you are tonight  

And and the evening dress

Sounds like Glenn Baxter 

Vicky liked to dress for afternoon tea 

I know

Sometimes I wonder Vicky 

Wednesday was a day when Vicky liked to dress up for tea 

Cake 

I feel so much better now I know he 's in London and he 's not going to come round

Give me a fright

Oh yeah

God 

The dreaded Basil

Mm 

Oh dear 

Oh 

In a way I wish he had come round yesterday

Mm

Would have been sweet

Yeah

It 's a shame he 's not going to be back here

I know

I know

Yeah

Is he going to come back here though in between going to  Vienna and going to  New York

Well

I 'm not sure that he is actually

Mm 

Gosh 

Is this company one that he worked for before he came  to Cambridge

Yes

I think he uhm  w worked

Laura likes tea bags you see after they 've had taken some of the strength out

You don't need to explain to us

Bloody skinflint

She 's getting meaner by the day 

Is the poison in that one

Yeah

So make sure she drinks it

And the off milk as well 

When she starts to have the convulsions in a minute nobody call the doctor

Just leave her 

Then it might be over quickly 

 we haven't noticed

Yeah right

We can always put a pillow over her head 

I think it 's for the best

The mattress

I do

It 's for her own good

Good of everyone around her

Oh goodness

That 's right 

Oh well

Never mind

Excuse me

Yeah cos obviously you 've  to death now  

Oh it 's very light

It 's not as strong as it looks

Thank you

The milk 's just hanging around at the bottom  

It 's a bit hot 

That sounded pretty bad  

God 

Laura 's s is slightly weaker 

The way she 's feeling for about seven years

Mm

Mm 

That is odd isn't it 

My God it makes me cry though watching things like this

Mm 

I should have

Oh dear

I 've made Laura 's in the wrong cup 

Oh  I don't want to be poisoned  

I don't want her to catch your cold 

She 's just  early grave

Lick right round the rim

 

Just in case 

Perhaps I should uhm 

Or wear a yellow star  

Unclean 

The thing is 

More like a Jihad 

Was it you who was saying about uhm  moderate Shiites

What 's a

 put the pin back

Yeah that 's it

Time for bed

What 's a moderate Shiite 

Oh Dad you 're such a 

He 's brilliant your dad

D' you think so

  

I didn't

Well ca I can't get

Here you are now I 've made it

Oh thank you

Sir

Probably all germ infested

Yeah

Yeah

Did you enjoy Vic Reeves

Yes

It was really good

Oh great

Good

Cos those take two hours long or something

three-or-four-words



Yeah

He had you He had know when he says things like  this is the time of evening when I like to put a a hazelnut under a squirrel or something

He was doing it with Golden Grahams

You know the  breakfast cereal 

Have you got his album

Yeah

I 'd really love to tape it from you if you if you didn't mind

Yeah

If you give me a tape I 've got a tape to tape and I can run it off

Oh great that 'd be

Well

I mean

cos a actually thinking about it I 've not got a uhm record player or anything

So yeah



You can make tunes from it

Oh good 

So the thing is is everyone else going to be dressed up at this party 

Don't compare yourself with anyone else

I 'll go in the corner

And strip off again

Oh I know

I mean like Sheila 's friends an are quite sort of  glam and Sheila 's very glamorous

And she

Can always come back if they lock me out 

So  we 'll have to ask them cos if they 're all wearing jeans I 'll feel like a right wally to 

I hate going to parties that you don't know whether to

Excuse me

Yeah

I know

  

It 's like some friends of mine got engaged in uhm but they

and they had an engagement party in June

and it was just like Sunday brunch

And then and I still didn't know what everybody was wearing

And everybody was just wearing jeans which is quite

You know when you just don't know yeah



Yeah it 's weird

Feel terrible

It makes you feel so uncomfortable to begin with though doesn't it 

Mm

You 'll just have to take an overnight bag with all the possibilities in so you can zip up to the bathroom and change 

Oh God

That was helpful wasn't it

Thanks

Well the thing I 'm worried about more than anything is having to go into his office dressed up like a dog 's dinner 

I don't think you 've got anything to worry about though

I mean i i if you 've you 've got a coat to cover everything up

Mm

I have

Yeah

You 're right

That 's nice 

I think I 've got it on backwards or something

I put it on with the zip done up

No wonder it was so tight 

Help 

Oh God I 'm going to stop for a minute 

Headache city

Got a

Have I 

That 's right

Well I probably have got spots on my back 

Just marks 

Cover them up I suppose 

Can't see any can you 

I 'll give you that stuff Caroline

Oh good 

Thank you 

What do you think with that 

I think the brown  to be honest

You think the brown

Mm yeah 

OK

Thing is with brown if it 's really smart that 's fine

but then if it 's not they 're not so smart that 's fine as well

you know

Whereas that 's really smart isn't it

Yeah

Yes

Yeah

Smart 

It 's more dressy isn't it

Yeah

It 's more sort of fiftiesish 

Mm

It 's nice to have a contrast of colour

Yes

That 's true

Mm

Yes

Otherwise you look like a black thing

Especially if it 's black tie

The length 's nice  

I 've got brown shorts 

Show me  

Ah where are they 

When I was going to my school in Great Dunmow a couple of well last week there was a place that had loads of these uhm what do you call them  rails for sale

Mm

Really

Yeah

They 're very useful

They 're really good

Really useful

They match the shirt 

Would you wear black tights 

Would I look like I was auditioning for Robin Hood 

I think the dress

Cos then you can always take the shirt off

It 's brilliant

 

You 're right 

You 're right

Wouldn't that be awful if you forgot you had the shorts on  

Ah

God

I think that 's the kind of thing I could easily do in my present state of mind

Low blood sugar

No brains

Something this happened to me

I was feeling really exhausted

and I was wandering round Sainsbury 's with a basket and just  going up and down and backwards and forwards n not knowing what to buy or anything 

Oh

I 'm always doing that

And and I fill my tro my thingy up my basket

and then I decide I don't want anything that 's in it

so I run round round all the shelves putting everything back

and then I walk out in a  in a flap

In a flap

Mm yes 

Well 

 

No letters 

No mail at all 

Oh dear 

 

Right

It 's the brown I think 

You look really nice

Mm 

You 're right

A shirt is the best thing  with a brooch 

I know it seems I 'm getting a bit carried away

I know

And I just want  to look nice

And black earrings

They 're nice yeah

Mm 

Get rid of my red ringed eyes 

I wouldn't really be looking forward to be getting dressed up on Friday

I know

I 'm glad w I said to Laura I 'm glad we didn't dress up last night because three-or-four-words

All those people wearing jeans and things 

It wasn't worth it at all

Good God

You never know though do you

It would have been really embarrassing

Cos sometimes here everyone goes mental

 

I know

 

But it 's definitely black tie Friday

Right 

But I suppose I have got a little T that T-shirt black dress which is very undressy and I could wear the black shirt over the top but then 

May as well just wear all brown I suppose

Mm

J for tomorrow

 mmm



I 'd wear what

Are you happier with the length of the black one or  aren't you worried about the length of the brown one 

Uhm  but the brown one 's a bit short

Well I just feel it 's so short to wear with hi such high heels

I feel like a bit like an Essex girl 

But do you think it 's all right

Mm

Yeah it 's really good

I know lots of them will wear hi

I 'm just I feel so self-conscious in high heels 

But uhm

It 's just cos you 're not used to them

Yeah

It is really  I suppose 

My Comic Relief T-shirt 'd be the ideal garment 

It 's all right 

Tonight just a moment 

Can we put this big light off 

OK

It 's the brown dress then 

Let 's get rid of it

I have to go haring round 

God I hope Laura doesn't play this tape to anybody 

That would be awful wouldn't it

It 's private 

There were some headdresses in Debenham 's actually we which had sort of like half of a shawl on them

I couldn't really work out   

I horrid dresses that they had which they had like a massive shawl bit in velvet and then nothing on the other side

and it wa oh

it looked like they 'd forgotten half of it or something

It was horrid

Yeah

It 's what

Yeah

Ugh

Debenham 's has some very funny clothes

Yeah it does

Mm 

A real hotch potch

Mm 

Especially those sort of black swing coats 

Yeah

Oh I wouldn't touch those 

No

I wouldn't either 

Yuck 

Right 

Thing that pisses me off about my sister

whenever we have a family lunch she 's about six foot tall

and she wears eight-inch you know really high heels 

and then she always says something like it 's funny isn't it how I 'm so tall and you 're so short 

I hate her sometimes

Does she like being really really really tall

I think so

Mhm

And then I always want to say yeah  it 's funny why you 're so fat and I 'm not  cos she is quite

But then I 'm not horrible enough 

How much older is she than you Vicky

She 's thirty uhm 

How old is she

thirty-six 

But she 's actually my half sister

She 's got got the same  father 

Mmm

And so she really really looks like my dad though  and so does uhm  so does his other daughter who 's like eight 

I look like him a bit

I 've got his big fat nose

Mm

So  so look

the arrangements tomorrow will be  if we meet at seven o'clock at Covent Garden tube station outside

Yeah 

OK

We 've got to get to uhm

I 'm leaving my guitar at 

Oh I 'll bring it in in the morning

Shall I bring it

Well I mean  the arrangements 

What

Yeah 

The arrangements are that we go to Queensway tube station 

It 's the most  appropriate one 

Well Queensway is on the Central Line apparently 

Top of uh top of  W we come out

we go to the top of the road Queensway where it meets Westbourne Grove

We turn left and it 's second right  opposite Titles

It 's Westbourne Grove  uh  Terrace and he says it 's a tiny  tiny street and it isn't actually on an A to Z  but uhm

Yeah

Hang on 

Or I 'll bring it in  actually because just in case people 

Right



That 's right

Very convenient indeed

What 's the name

You got one Sid

You can say that again 

So sore

Plaster hurts

Yeah



 some new shoes

So uhm  shall I shall I bring it in in the morning or what shall I do

Well how shall I

You bring it in in the morning  if you want or  

Yeah

Right

And uhm 

 

So uh  so when are you meeting up with these other two then

You haven't arranged that yet 

It may have to be next Monday morning during the day at my flat

actually I 've been thinking

That 's the best solution

Well i it may be yeah

I mean there 's no I 've got uh my neighbours

Yeah

Problem

Well they are all out during the day anyway so  I mean it 's not really a problem 

But  it 's quite small 

Bring them round here

I 'm sure the girl upstairs would like percussion 

Yeah

I love that perfume

What

I 've got to get some 

Oh uhm she told me Karen said she 's going to she wants me to get on to a book now uhm 

I think it 's part one or something of it

and it 's by

Sticking plasters

D' you mind

D' you have some scissors  this one

Yeah

On there

That 's right yeah

And it 's uhm  it 's by uh 

Who is it by 

Somebody she gave me  as a refu as a 

No no 

What

Just mention it on your own

You 'll know it

Yes

Yeah

Well I 'll

I 'll tell you a name in a minute when I 've found Shadows in Love or whatever it is 

but it 's 

And uh 

Right



That 's the first thing by Jane Mitchell I 've heard in so many years which has really  caught me

Yeah

Really caught you

In fact 

Well actually playing it 's made all the difference

Hasn't it

It has  because you live through it

Yeah

Yeah 

But only one in fact it 's the only only sheet music that 's been published as far as we know that actually has the correct  tuning on it

Well Dominguez

but Dominguez ha has tuning that 's so radical

But I mean you could do it on a steel string

I mean it got it 's to do with the tension of the strings

You see nylon strings don't have the tension 

It doesn't

What did you say

Because she tunes down just on that 

I thought you were going to shut up 

Well I am

But uhm  but how 'd I mean you get the tunings from  the stick

Well what books shall I bring along

Shall I bring along  some books

Bring that Clive and uh 

So that you you stuff you can play in and y you can actually  you can teach him if need be

I 'll bring the stick down



But we want to try and do some of our own stuff  in terms of

Oh we will do 

No

We will do

That 's obvious

Because out of all  that 's the main thing in a way  if we want to see how he interacts with us too

Well even  even

Well we could always do 

It 'll always end up like that because we always end up bringing our things to do

and some sort of

What d' you mean by provisionally we can do it

Yeah

I mean we can do that without  problems

That 's quite interesting anyway

We shouldn't  that just because it 's an old song

Oh I know

But but we 'll do that and we 'll do that 

We 'll do that new one

It 's a good one as sort of test 



And uhm I 'm going to look through I 'm just going to look through and find  offhand 

Can I have a glass of water please

Take some salt in as well

Yeah

I wasn't  awful when you get when it gets cold and then the uh 

Yeah

Nerve yeah 

Yeah

Do you want it

Do you want tap water or this

Just normal water

It 's it 's Spa

Solpadeine is is uh

What

you want to use the tap water then

Just tap water will do

OK 

I did tell him that uhm  I I said did he mind if I came in dry and he said no

That seems a bit 

You know phoned him up and I said  Stuart and I uh 

The sound wasn't too good

Did you get it all

Did you get it all 

What 's the sound which is

There 's one particular sound

and it really gets  actually clear as

What title 

So  this is the person 

tell me if you know 

Fanny Waterman

have you heard of her

Of course I have

I 'm sorry

If you

You have

Yeah

Yeah

Fanny Waterman

I can re I can tell you every single book  that she 's written

Oh right

Well

I mean

according to Carole it 's probably  it 's probably the first one  or first one or two or the second one  of of a collection of what was rather a small piece of



Yeah

Fanny Waterman 

Yeah

A recital repertoire or concert pieces

No no

It 'd be  beginner student things

Or student repertoire

Yeah

Well they 're all meant for beginners

They ought to be called recital repertoires

But

Are they good

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah

They are

She 's got one one one of the early ones which has a base a very basic supplement

I don't know if that 's the recital one

If that 's the first

She said that she 'd find out precisely whether I should get Book One or Book Two tomorrow so I 'll ring her Wednesday morning

They always have them 

We  at the moment

Oh right

Oh I 'll come in and and get  I 'll get a  on Wednesday then

Yeah

And I 'd better get some single sheets for the the Board you know the uh singing grade for that 's  one of them getting  out for Thursday

so I 've got to get them on

uhm

I 've got to get them for Wednesday

Yeah

I we always have those you know

What

single sheets  or the Watermans

Yeah

Yeah

Because they do actually publish some single sheets

don't they 

They do actually publish some single sheets 

I might do that tomorrow if I 'm coming because I want 

Yeah

Oh yeah

Yeah



But sometimes 

And I could bring the guitar

I 'm going to the problem is I 'm going to tennis

and then I 've got in to

You don't want me to come here and then go off to

Oh leave it here

That 's an idea

You mean leave it at the Tortoise

No

I 'm saying I mean I could meet you here tomorrow night and then we could go off

No good

Well the thing is I 've got to come back from Covent Garden 

So there seems to be

Is that awkward for you then

Oh yes

What

To meet there

Can't you

Because you have to hang around H M V and then walk over or get the tube there

What time d' you want to meet in Johnson Street

Seven o'clock

Yeah

That 's OK





So then you can get the tube

Green Park

You 've got a pass

have you

Try and bring it in in the morning here

That 'd be the best thing

won't it

uhm  yes

I 've well I 've got the thing is I 've got to go out to  see someone at two o'clock St John 's Wood

I 'll try and bring it on the way in to St John 's Wood  and drop it in

Yeah 

Just drop it around 

Just the one thing

you know

and I 'll just

uh

Drop in on the way in 

I 'll do that

Yeah

That 's the last I take it home  anyway so

it 'll get bashed as too heavy

Oh no

Yeah

I agree 

uhm  let 's see

Yeah

That 's that 's fine



I love to sing

And that it is nice to sing

Yeah 



And that particular  song

But I didn't realise how nice until you sing you don't realise how

I mean 

the test of a song is when you break it down out of its arrangement and do it yourself and you you hear where the the points  where it pulls don't you in the right ways



Yeah

The lyrics are good

I know

You hear the good bits

Where 's my pencil

Oh it 's

Uhm  yeah

Over there



Song isn't likely 

I don't know where I 've got to



It could be in a number of piles

Piles 

No

I think



Piles

I don't think it 's in well it must be here

It 's blue

isn't it

Yeah

Black really

Black

Black is the colour 

If I if I get into that dance  if there is somebody who can uhm 

these black guys in the gym

They are always singing in the the men 's

They are always going  hey girl 

I got

Well that kind of leads to certain disaster

All that is is absolutely so ham

calling Jesus

And they really like it 

They sing that they love all that 

It 's a cultural thing that you know

It 's definitely 



They do they do it with all these gaps

 

Cos it 's very sincere

that is



And it 's the oppos it 's the exact antithesis of real soul

Yes

Can you open a little more

Yes 

A little more in vowels d' you see

I 'm having problems with  with that sound

I 'm It feels  I 'm not quite placing yes not quite placing

well I 'm doing something wrong with the actual I think the intonation 



At the ooo

I don't feel you 're getting there immediately 

You do get there 

Do you know what I mean

But it seems to me that uh you 're not opening that you 're not opening up the vowel in advance you 're

you 're doing it sort of when you actually get there

Too late

No

But it 's

I 'm not quite  centring

Yeah

So you already feel your palate up just before you sing the note



Yes

You do something like

Mm

Yes

I 'm dipping



Yes yes

Yes

Big difference

Right 



Yes 

Yes

That 's much better

Mm 

Yes 

Just a bit flat on the second note 



No no no

I think a little bit more 

Yes

Yes 



That 's better 

That 's better

Mm

Yes

That 's that 's It 's like sliding I have

Yes

Yes 

But you 're sort of taking one vowel into the next which  you mustn't do 

Yes  yes

Actually a lot of the problems in singing are caused by not actually preparing  in time

Yes

Yes the anticipation is crucial   big difference

It is  absolutely

Right 



Yes 

Here they count  on the third one

I 'm still finding I 'm finding that there 's something wrong with the  Oo oo oo

I 'm not getting it 

Yes

It 's The sound 's lost

You 're hitting it too far forward now

No

Just Just be a little more relaxed and a little more open 

Obviously when you 're singing your vowels must be a little more open than when you 're speaking  otherwise it 's Ooooo

It 's too tight you see

Yes

Yes

Too 

Yeah 

Too contrived

Make sure your jaw 's unhinged

and start with that  feeling 

So this is how you I 'm I 'm sort of imposing my voice on it instead of letting it come naturally

I 'm sort of giving it a slant

You 're not open enough at at this level

You know what I mean 

Yeah 

Yeah

Open it



Yeah

I think it could be even a bit more open

Yes 

Always towards O

Yes

That 's more like it

Only not as much O 

That 's right

But a But a But a little bit more towards it 



Yeah

But now it 's O 

And hit it as far as you can go on the top note but still think Oo  and think very hard on your palate

That was better 



Keep your palate up 

That 's it

Just be careful 

Yes

Be careful

That 's better 

Be careful that you don't let your palate drop and owowow and you get that sound

Mm

Yeah so you

No

Let 's do it this way

Sorry

It 's all right

So you go up on O and come down on Ooo and see if we can get to it that way 

That was a bit That was certainly easier 

Well let 's do it again only this time your little  meantime



Yeah

Yeah 



That will set the shape for you 

Yes

That one I haven't worked at I mean

OK



Yes

Like that 



Yes

Do that one again 

Much more unhingey 



I 'd keep those two exactly the same 

The space here is exactly the same but you tighten that Ah perhaps just with a little

That 's all

that 's all 

Ah 

Yeah



Yeah



How about that 

It 's a case of keeping  a bit more open sort of the jaw more unhinged and the palate up like crazy the whole time and just simply as if you loosen all the nuts and bolts on the valve  

Yes



Yeah

Watch coming down 

It 's that note that 's a little flat because you 've stopped concentrating on making these higher notes and you do let the whole thing sag a little 

Yes

Mm

Right 

Just do this 

High 

Yes

It 's much sharper than you think that note 

Yes

Sing them more on a plane 

D' you know what I mean 

Mm 

Yes

But take care



Try again 



A little bit flat 



That was better

That was better 

Yes

It 's a very subtle  change isn't it

Yes

Yes yes 

Is it irritating

I 'm hearing a little catch 

It just sounds a little affected

No

Not at all

It 's just heavy

It 's just heavy

There 's not uhm  It 's just a bit coughy there 's

there 's no strain whatsoever

No

I 'm not 

Yes 

Yes 

No no 

That 's fine

Uhm  work at that then 

Work at that and and do listen to your pitch

Yes

That one

Yes 

I 'm It 's the same with the sight-singing exercises

I 'm sure I 'm

I 'm coming last week with you

last time I 'm coming down

I 'm not quite getting the right sharp

You tended to drop your 

And they 're all being dropped too much and partly it 's the palate 

You see if you let the palate drop  that somehow  pulls the whole thing down 

Right  do this 

Yes

I drop when I come down

Yeah

Yeah



Yeah 

Make sure it still resonates

You 're  



Right 



Yes

It 's a little

Yes

They 're too breathy 

And now you lean over that on the high notes

Yes

Bre

Yes

Could I do that little high bit a little bit slower

Yes

 

Yes exactly 

Now what would you do there 

That was correct

Yes

Yes 

I did that 

Fine

Right

It 's on the next one as well 



That makes you 

You see if you could keep it in

Yes

Yeah

Keep in that  place

Yeah

Sort of

Yes

Plane 

Flat

No

It 's because you 're not singing it in the same place 

Yes

Try and judge where you

I 've got to place it more  

 but You didn't do it then

It was so good when you did it right 



No no no

That 's too breathy 



No no no

Get the first note right 

Do it on O then 



You 're taking You 're using an awful lot of breath

Yeah

I know

I 'm  I seem to be doing this in a different place

Yes

You are now

but I 'm getting the right pitch

and I 'm doing

What I 'll do  exactly but I 'm doing I 'm getting the right pitch and I 'm doing 



I 'm putting you off

No

You 're not

No

I 've got to get it

No

But try it 

Oh no

I 'd better try again

No

That 's not right

There 's too much breath 



That 's nearer to it

Yes

It 's sort of

No no no

Now it was closed up at the back 



No 

Try it

That 's right 



A little more

A little more in the hard palate

There

Yes

It 's really

Yeah

In the hard palate 

Yeah

That 's not  I think we

It just sounds a little toward that bit tired

Sorry

Tired

Toward

It does sound a little tired

Yeah

It is

It is my voi my speaking voice is very much lower 

something 's resting on it

Yes exactly 

Yes exactly 

But it shows though you can still  rise above it

try  if you keep it up 

It 's like  It 's like it 's

I

You can

Of course you can if you can place it

It 's just a bigger effort that 's all  keeping the ball in the air

When you were saying about the analogy it 's the rising sun

I 'm doing a flamenco course and there 's a marvellous movement  when you do this

You go You have to hold

She keeps You 've got to keep the tray on the hand 

And then it 's like one two three one two three one two three

You 've got to keep it up high when you are doing the footwork 

And it 's like  the same thing with the voice you got to while you 're  moving

you 've got to keep it there and the audience has got to see it up there

It mustn't dangle 

It 's wonderful flamenco

And the thing that 's so wond wonderful

Oh gosh

Yes

Oh yes

Yes

It  has to be 

Yes

Yes

Quite

There used to be when I was young when I first came down to London a marvellous Spanish  troupe  Antonio 's

Don

Antonio

I know

I heard of him

My parents saw him and said he was the best  unbelievable

He was

He was

He was 

Yes

He 's a famous famous dancer  and his troupe

Yes

Yes there was one woman particularly I 've forgotten what she was called in his group 

They were amazing 

I mean the audience used to go mad as soon as he came on and dipped just the slightest movement 

The houses were always packed



There is one group called

Yeah

Yeah

Yes

But he was

You saw him in town did you always

I saw him in London

In London  Palladium or something

My parents said they saw him said he was just the 

 but I 've seen him more than once

There 's no one to compare

I mean there 's Antonio Gardez  but he never comes over

His troupe do flamenco versions of Carmen and things like that 

They 're just wonderful 

But there 's no male dancer like that

There 's There 's a group called Coimbre Flamenco who I saw at Sadler 's Wells

And it is popular again now  flamenco dancing and music but they don't have a star in the way that this this chap obviously was 

Yes

Oh yes

Yes

Mm 

Mm

Mm

Oh he was

And he was very slight

Yeah

You know nothing

His face was nothing to look at

But he 's

But the minute he came on the stage

and there was a spotlight and it was just him

I mean  the charisma  was colossal  you know

I mean he really was something very special 

Yes well I used to find it so exciting

That 's all he needed to do just the slightest movement with his feet and the way he stood 

I mean it just  knocked you sideways

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah

Yes I know

I

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yeah

My parents said exactly the same thing

They said one one gesture and he was 

He just had this amazing

Yes

It is the most wonderful It 's a wonderful communication that dance and it 's very sensual

So intense

And they did sing

and a guitarist and a voi and a singer

But they would they were very much in the shadows 

and it was him  all by himself on this stage you know 

Great

You know there are few people like that in whatever field  aren't there



Yes

Yeah

Field

Fields

Yes at a time

And it just sets the thing alight

It needs  It does need the individual to set the whole  thing doesn't it because it 's only the individual who can do it on 

You can't have a group feeling the same thing always expressing the same thing 

It 's not

Somebody 's got to focus it

Yes exactly

It does

It does

No

It isn't the same

You need a focus

Yes

Mm

The other thing that 's marvellous I started doing for singing is uhm  uh classical ballet technique 

Basic ballet

Yes

Because of the breathing the way the breathing really  and the positioning

I mean it 's basically Alexander Technique I think that

Based on it a lot  and the movements  the straight back

Yes

And also there 's 

Well  something like that

Mm

But of course Alexander came along after classical ballet

Yes

But of course he took  uh uh classical ideas and adapted himself

That 's what I thought

You know

Yeah  well

It was very much his own idea wasn't it

D' you D' you have d' you have that book on him

Do

I couldn't find it

I don't know what

I think I must have lent it to somebody

The girl from the Guildhall who I started last week with guitar she she says she practises it and she 's going to tell me what she does

But she 's very hot on posture

But she goes to a teacher

W

I think she does

Uhm I haven't thought

The thing is you 're not supposed to do it without your teacher

Yes

Oh I see

Yeah

That 's what they say

You must only do it with your teacher  because you can so easily get into the wrong 

They don't like you to do anything until you 're very well established

Oh I see 

Mm

Grooves

Yeah 

Yeah

Yes

Well she must she must 've had a teacher in Spain

She 's already said whether

whether she 's going to continue it here I 'm not sure 

But uhm  the the the it 's marvellous it just gives you a you know

It 's very good for

What 's good about ballet

it 's

I can see if you can get the posture right look would look very very good on a stage  because you won't have the slouch  you 'd have a back

But the focus of the eyes is similar to focus when you 're doing singing exercises

And she 's very disciplined about where you 're focusing  not looking down not looking you know

That 's That 's related

And control of all these

Yes

Yes yes

Yes 

Yes

Quite 

Quite

I mean singers have to learn you see  not to sort of go into a hall and  and do all this

Do all this

Provided you keep everything else still it 's the eyes 

You see there 's a terrible there 's a terrible feeling I mean nervous young singers they don't want to look at the audience 

They don't want to catch anybody 's eye

I mean it can be very offputting

If you catch somebody 's eye suddenly it could distract 

D' you know what I mean 

So they 've actually got to learn

Well first of all they learn to sing above the heads  you know but yet to look as if they 're singing to the audience

But then if they actually do look at the audience they have to learn to sweep it  to sweep all the faces without actually catching an eye you know

But I find with young singers very often that that it 's that they 'll they 'll be quite still but their eyes are and I always think it 's like they 're looking to the nearest means of escape you know

their eyes sort of dart all over the hall and it looks if they 're trying to think where do I make for if if it gets too heavy you know

It It has a very nervous uhm

Yeah

Of course

Mm

Yeah

Mm

Yes

Yes 

Yes it 's

That 's very difficult sort of that side of it

To actually learn to be poised and to just focus on one

To focus

Yes

It 's quite

The b The best singer is this Olaf Bergh that I 've seen

There 's actual

He has total concentration

He seems not to move a muscle in a whole evening 

And it 's totally relaxed and concentrated

And I mean it it gets to the whole audience and the audience doesn't do all this coughing and spluttering that they do between songs

It 's It 's as if he 's hypnotising  as if his stillness and his poise actually hypnotises the audience 

And to get that

Oh yes with  gait and tone

Mm 

He presumably works

Yes interesting yeah 

Yeah

Yes

Yes

No it 's abs 

That 's marvellous isn't it

Do you think

I must see him now

He 's coming over

I know he 's coming again

Is he

Yeah

Oh

Well look out 

Well there 's a chap that singer at Trinity

He 's now working there and what 's the name of that Emmy Ameling is coming next month

Elly Ameling

Yeah

Emmy Ameling



Elly

Elly Ameling

She 's coming

But there 's nothing left I don't think

Oh there won't be now

No

And I wouldn't have got around to it because my friend who gets these seats  is away

she 's ill

I know

You said

Well I 'll go and I 'll ask him

Because he 's working on the door he may just hap hear of a few seats

I 'll tell you if I can get something

Yeah

But it 's next month I think she 's going to

He said that she 's coming soon

I thought it was October

I think

Maybe it 's just not

I was wondering 

would you like to do some sight singing

Mm

Yes

I 'd love to

Just you know

Would you like me to use your this book or

No

Let 's use my book  because then you don't you can still use yours

D' you see what I mean so that you don't actually

Well it 's not wasting but you know what I mean uhm 

Now  this this book is mostly about what they call modulation where you actually go to another key in the course of the exercise

So we won't use that  for the time being

Yeah



Yeah

No

Oh yeah uh during the exercise

What I would actually like to do



Yes

It 's OK

Yeah

Yes

It 's nice 

That 's nice 

That 's beautiful 

That 's fabulous

I love that

Yeah

That 's great

Really good

That 's lovely

There 's a real sort of inner logic it 's got 

unya Unusual 

That 's 

No 

I 'm just trying to

I like that sort of exchange between

Yes 

I can't possibly account for it

We 've got a song there already

It 's amazing isn't it 

I 'm just trying

How does it go now

We got it down

but it  was a bit

when you moved it that sounded really good 

D' you want me to put anything like cheese on toast on

or anything you 've had lunch already

I wouldn't mind some coffee actually

Coffee

I 've got to go I 'm afraid in an hour 

Is that all right

We can work again on Thursday

Yeah

That 's all right I mean

I thought it 's been

I know

I really

Yeah



We 'll go through it again 

 if that 's all that you know

I mean as long as we 're doing that one of those 

I still find it

I can't say how it 's

I mean you

I 'll just say you know that your s guitar playing is so pianistic

If it meant anything

No

It is

It 's so exciting 

What sort of things does your mate write about

Lyrics Just purely sort of

 existential

Are they

What he he

Does he

Is he eloquent

Is he a very good lyric writer

He thinks he is 

I 'd like to write 

He 's very widely read

Sorts of what

D' you mean philos philosophy and stuff like that or

I like

I 've read

I 've read 

He always seems who they 're going to have a passion for

I 've read more than virtually anyone of my 

I 've I 've read masses of stuff but I mean y you can only draw on things that are appropriate to what you 're doing can't you

I mean I could write a whole sequence of stuff based on you know

How does he

I mean how does he

Does he work hard on

Yeah I know yeah

Yeah

Basically he left school at sixteen so he 's always had a sort of guilty feeling

He 's always made up for it though

It 's not very good

it 's not very

Yeah yeah

He ro reads a lot

and he always seems to know who are the latest and the

Right

So he 's

That 's the import

You see I don't read much now 

read all the time

But he 's not

He 's very into magical realism and all that sort of crap you know

What 's that

Magical realism

have you heard of that

Magical realism

Yeah Angela Carter

Yeah

Yeah

And what these Latin American uh

I can't stand those

uh you know they are sort of associated with you know

I don't see the point a-few-words-obliterated-by-music 

That 's sort of stunning that 



That 's it

Doesn't it  that perfect

 Yeah I 'd like

Are you tired or something

Just a touch of milk in that this time

Fine yeah

Have a quick break

Yeah

That 's really uh

I mean the the point about any anything like this is that as long as it keeps anything keeps alive  alight then you don't have to do it ten hours a day 

You it It 'll come and there 's gestation as well in things because I 'm beginning to inside me I 'm beginning to really get me going really wanting to  get something right and I know it 's early stages  because but at least if you 're involved in something creative  it 's original

Yeah

Yeah

No no it 's yeah I mean

Yeah

Yeah  yeah  yeah

That 's brilliant

It 's like

Nobody 's really doing quite anything like this

Not really with guitar and voice in that way

No No but not as advanced

I mean although people like Fran Kennedy are doing kind of  things I mean I think my chord 'll

It 's much more interesting 

But also it 's not it 's not the bits

Yeah well

I don't want to sound arrogant about it but it 's yeah I mean you can hear the Brazilian  influences as well

Yes

It 's got It 's got a great sort of variety of influence as well as being your own feel

Yeah

Yeah which is what it 's about really

It 's not locked in a particular type of playing  uhm which I suppose 

Yeah

I mean it 's really like

I mean I suppose John Mit uh John Martin 's quite similar in some ways  some of his

Yes I

I know I 've I 've heard some of his earlier

I don't know his recent work

Well his recent work 's shit actually  to be blunt  but uh his his old stuff 's fantastic some of it

Is it  is it

What like uhm 

It 's very uhm  you know solid

Solid 

You mean like all that uh Solid Air and all that stuff you like

Yeah

Yeah 

What about The Apprentice then

That 's what

really depressing is it

or

I don't really know actually

There 's a dentist I know that 's got a clock in his house and and he 's got wisdom teeth where all the  where all the numbers should be 

It looks good actually cos they 're all very clean obviously and it looks good 

Charming

Lovely

You sounded very convinced 

Yeah 



Sorry



Yeah 

You saw the clock didn't you

Yeah

Where was this

At 

Oh I remember

Oh yes

Actually I knew I had seen it and I couldn't think where

Yes

Oh the clock

Yeah

A slate

It was a slate and it 

Yes

I didn't realise they were wisdom teeth until someone pointed them out

They were just really incredible 



I had a couple out uhm last





How 's your chin

Pardon 

Slight it 's still slightly numb cos I had them out under a local anaesthetic and they really really hurtled me around

And this lower left  was really stubborn

Is it any better now

I mean I had my eyes closed but I opened them 

They 're slightly better

I don't know

Oh yes 

And uh when I opened my eyes in fact there was a woman with her hands both hands s heavily down on my chest while the uhm dentist was cutting

Mm ooh

Don't tell me 





It was qu

I mean I I can laugh about it now

do you know what I mean 

Mm







That 's right

That 's right

Mm 



I could never have anything under local

I want a general

Mm 



Well yeah

And it can be more dangerous

But a friend of mine pulled some cartilage in her leg when she was playing squash

and she had that done under local 

And it was awful because they had to give her uh uh uh injection in her back

It was apparently really dangerous because if they get the wrong point there

She was she was paralysed for all the time that that operation was go you know all the time that the uhm  anaesthetic was you know

And that was about nine hours that she just couldn't move

It was really painful for her because she had to just sit like that all the time watch her fis her leg operated on 

Mm

Earl Gray tea for everyone



Yeah please

Lovely 













Out of the teapot that dribbles

Crispy noodles anybody

Oh no

Oh

Oh no

W well did he leave it there







How did you 

Oh





I was going to say someone in  



I 've heard horrible stories

I 've heard horrible stories of people having vaccinations and the needles getting broken

Yeah John Barlow had that happen to him once at school













 that vaccinations are bad enough already without having 

Was it painful when they

Cos then you would you 'd feel it if it

Oh



 

No

But if the needle broke

Mm 





Yeah

It 's odd really 

Cos I remember having my stitches done in Spain

And uh  I didn't know what was going on  cos I 'd just had a dreadful accident

And they were done perfectly

This is a very good soup

I mean I can't really remember what was going on

I remember an aw awful lot of pain but uhm 

And I realised that was just th th

I thought it was all over in and then they just put this painkilling injection in 

My chin was





They did a very good job thank goodness

Mm 

My wrist is a lot better now

Good

 a broken wrist

And my ankle





I broke my right wrist riding my bike  in Germany

 

Mm



I hadn't I hadn't either before then

I haven't



I know

It wasn't a very nice time to do it at your place for the first time

You know 

No

Why couldn't

Cos Jill was working in a 



It was wonderful





I couldn't after that 

That was it

Yeah

That was it

You couldn't serve 







Oh that 's horrible

I 've had that done





Oh no





How come you know this

















What did you g actually get

an anaesthetic

I don't remember having an anaesthetic for mine

Did you

Yeah I did





Cos I had it cauterised

Do they always an

I wasn't done but the 









It does hurt yeah 

He did that

Mother asked me whether you 'd





How old were you

















You don't want to see





Is that when you had the smelling salts





And did he pour it over you

or just





Well actually smelling salts are really good

Uhm uhm I thought it was a liquid

It 's just sort of it is actually salt is it I I







It 's ammonia or something isn't it



Oh yeah that smells like urine doesn't it







He went on to have a long and illustrious career







Oh God

That 's the worst you could say of a doctor

He meant well

Why have I  my first job 

Yes

You 've probably gone down in dinner party anecdotes for that



What about the time when  our dentist said to Sue before she was go going to have her wisdom teeth out

oh don't worry

Only one in so and so dies

I 've only lost one patient he said



Oh no very seriously 



Yes

Talked about a percentage

You 've got a fifty-fifty per cent chance of 

Well he was talking about uhm the advantages of a uh a general over a local anaesthetic for my wisdom teeth

And he said I said what about general

He said oh well



Uhm I think I 'll do them actually by hand some of them by hand some of it

Uhm I don't know which one I prefer actually 

Mine 's got a big uhm 

OK

That 's really funny

We both bought watches at different times and different places

and we ended up with the same uhm same make and same sort of model but

but mine 's slightly more expensive

They they are basically the same watch but



Ah hah

The same ghastly family taste

That 's really funny cos you bought yours in  the year before I did and you know 

And I didn't even know you had that watch

Mm

I know 

You don't like 

Obviously got drummed in a certain taste in clothes 

You don't like coffee particularly strong do you

Uhm strong is all right

That 's OK

Mm

Mm

Uhm

Uh no but you have it with 

So we 're conditioned to like this type of watch







Oh we have so much in common



What 's that



Yes

That 's right



It 's a family trait

Yes



That 's right



Mm 





Ah  I I saw a picture of myself yesterday in an album with uhm sitting up in bed next to my Bay City Rollers poster

Oh no way



Bay City Rollers and Ray Clemence s' legs

I don't know 

You were interested in the Famous Five

Come on if we 're  

The Famous Five were better than Bay City Rollers weren't they

I mean Famous Five was a really good 

Well you enjoyed reading them

Can't say that you didn't enjoy that

No

I can't say I didn't

Bet you read every book as well



You di you weren't into Famous Five

 





Yes

I know

I wish 

 even invited them when we were on holiday when we were 

Did you ever read The Far Away Tree

That was very good

No

Well it was really good

It 's a tree with all these people living in it and

Is it too strong

No no no no

I 've had a tickling for 



Mm

And there used to be islands and they used to go round and round and then one would stop at the top of the tree and they 'd get on and experience whatever that land had to offer 



Oh

Mm 

And there 'd be this guy that always used to snore with his mouth wide open in the tree

and and they the others used to pop acorns in through his mouth



Oh it was an Enid Blyton book

Oh Dad do you know uhm if Busy Busy World is easily accessible 

Uhm

Do you know where it might be because uhm Bob and I were talking about it the other

Well Bob hasn't seen Busy Busy World but he likes Richard Scarry

No





Think so





Yes

Yes



Well actually isn't it in the loft somewhere

Uhm if you come across any uhm Ian word-whispered

Mm

Yeah

Probably in my well probably in the hole in the roof 

In the loft I think actually

Yes 

 

On the right I reckon they 're on the right hand side 

You mean

I might be wrong 

Do you mean 

Right hand side when you uh get through

Right 

Well I mean yeah when you just w walk in

Yes

I think

But I might be wrong 

Uh  well 

Yeah

Don't forget to look for them

I could be getting some things out of there uh 

No

But I have a feeling they might be right by the door but if they 're not then it 's not worth it

No

It 's not 

There 's a box of books

Yes

Sorry 

A box of books

Yeah

But I don't know anything about them 

Well I can only have a look

No

No but  won't look herself probably

I 'll look I 'll look myself 

Yeah

That 's a good idea

I 'll look myself

All right

Thinking of moving your table out to your main room

You may want to do that

Right that 's cleared up

Quickly cleared off

Sorry

That was quickly cleared off

Oh 

Fine he says

Love from everybody

Love to everybody rather 

Will that be all right

Orange juice

Mmm super

Thank you

What if I uhm do you think I better freeze the other half of these

There is another plate in the

Uhm I know

You will miss breakfast

Yes that would be very

Breakfast dry freeze

You could just put them down there

Haven't really had breakfast

Back to the

Look in the bottom drawer

They may not have been taken out 

Do you think you would like to eat

Would anybody like to eat I mean  for breakfast

Yes

I mean you don't have to



Right OK good 

When I was alone in Barcelona I was having avocado and French bread for breakfast

Oh

Tell us about Barcelona then

And the avocados are so cheap

They are about I don't know ten P or something for avocados

What are you doing 

The market in Barcelona

Thank you very much

You know something

When I was in Barcelona I was having  I lived on avocado and French bread for breakfast

It doesn't sound that serious but it was just because it was cheap

And cheese and bread



I lived on cheese bread and tomatoes and oranges when I was



Good heavens

It must have

Did you not like the German cakes then





And you lost weight



Oh I see

I could live on cake

That is true 

You know what there is in the drawer

What

Oh he 's jumping up again

Oh I 'll go

What time is it 

Twenty past eight

Ah yeah

Yeah 

Fancy a drink John

We 've got some left

I think all the pubs are closed

No

We 've got some in the fridge some ale and uh  other drinks in the in the other cupboard cupboards if you fancy it

I didn't mean go out for a drink

I meant would you like a drink

Would you like a drink from the fridge John

uh yes 

I 'll get it myself cos you won't know what I want  and I won't know what you 've got  unless I go out there

Catherine are you going to have everything

Uhm I 'll have a vodka and lemonade if you 've got any



Yes

There 's a lot of your vodka left that you 

Yeah

That 's right

Fizzy lemonade



Yeah

You did not say that at all



You said

oh  means uh

it means some just just what you said like 

Oh it 's sort of a kind of a a sort of a a negative kind of a word in a way like

In a way 

Aren't you going to have a drink of anything Harry 



The ginger wine 

Right 

Have you got orange juice

Yes

You can  didn't you

Strange

There 's grapefruit juice as well  in the fridge

Oh actually I 'll have vodka and orange

Yeah

I 'll have vodka and orange in it

But it 's all Del Monte

Yes

Well it is Del Monte but it 's unsweetened 

I mean

So

Yeah

Well Del Monte uh uh are very instrumental in uh keeping the apartheid regime together in uh South Africa

Yeah

And that 's why I will never drink Del Monte juice

Are they

Oh

I didn't know that

That 's why I never drink juice when I come here because the only one you buy is Del Monte

Well it seems the best one

Some of the others are too sweet

It may be may be good for you but it 's not very good for never been very good for the black people in South Africa

Yeah I don't

Oh well I can't help that to that extent

I mean

Well you can help it

You could help it by not buying any

I

Yes

I know that

But I can't I 'm not going to buy something inferior if I want something nice to drink

Well there are perfectly good other juices which are just as good 

Anyway you want a j yes you want a you want a vodka and orange juice 

I 'll have a vodka and orange

Have you still got that damn machine on

Uhm yes 

But you can't you see you 're not meant to notice it

It 's got to be the tape 's got to be on for

They disregard the first fifteen minutes anyway  because they reckon that it won't be natural

Oh but that 's only if the people know it 's on uh 

Yeah

But they said because you 've got to tell someone in advance you can't just put it on without them knowing

They said it 's illegal 

I mean 

So you 've got to keep that running for fifteen minutes 



Not that one he didn't because I didn't have that

No no

Yes



I would put my I would set my tape recorder to record

Yes

That 's what he means stripped down



My tape recorder which I had at that time 

Yeah

But if he 's going to be so  horrible and say all these ridiculously stupid things about the way things that we say then I 'm going to be a completely pedantic and pick up every little thing that he says

Yeah

But you see he you can't win an argument

What you I mean they they won't they won't listen to any other viewpoints  but their own



That 's right

Because they 're so dogmatic and set in their ways and

Yeah

They 're right because they 're the parents

And we 're wrong because we 're the children

I I remember being amazed when I grew up that your parents aren't always right

When you 're little you think they are

It didn't take very long to realise that



Catherine

Yeah



Sorry



I can't hear you

You don't know what you 're talking about at all

So what what happens in fact

You 've got to record you 've got to record us for fifteen minutes and and and

Well as long as possible really but uhm

Well I can do different I 'm going to do different ones

You 've got to cut off the first fifteen minutes

You have to prove to the teacher that you 've got to cut off the first fifteen minutes or do you just

No I don't have to

No

They he just told me this when I when he was explaining it to me

And it

Cos I said uhm cos I said if I can't uh

if I have to tell them in advance won't it sound unnatural  you know

so I 'm going to sort of I thought of doing Mum and Dad

Mum you you know

and they said

oh well we we disregard that cu

cut it

just disregard

They start listening





Oh no actually I 've got this special machine that cuts off

As soon as it hears my voice it cuts it off



Do you want anything to eat

He 's going to say he 's going to put a special uhm 

You have special symbols for when you can't can't actually hear something when you 're doing transcribing and that 's what gets transcribed you see

Well I did a transcribe a transcribed a Terry Wogan interview for an assignment

And it 's really difficult cos everybody speaks on top of each other and you when you actually lay it out you 've got to do you know

Thank you Dad

Of the people you 're interviewing you mean

Cos there 's so many interruptions

and it gets it 's a nightmare

I did one and a half minutes and it took me about three hours just to you know write out and rewrite again

Yes

How many people 're in the interview

Just two

Only two

Yeah

But then I had to do everything

I was doing all other aspects of communication non-verbal and everything hand movements

No it was a video

I videoed it on T V

Ah

A radio interview you used

Oh I see

Oh

I got B plus 

Do you want anything to eat

No thanks

I 'm not hungry Esther

No

No

Do you want anything to eat



You finished it already and I haven't even got mine yet 

Do you want another one

I 'm going to do my flatmates as well

But but I mean like I said I 'd put it in the lounge so they get used to seeing it but they 're every time Jonathan my flatmate goes in he looks at this tape recorder and then if I go he goes out the room for two minutes he comes back and looks at it again

To see whether it 's on or not

Yeah

Well put it in a put it in a little case or a box little box or something

Yeah

I should do

Yeah

Good idea

So that he can't see the tape going round or he can't see the  little light or he can't see the button that you press

Cover it with s make something to cover it  so  so that he 's just not going to know whether it 's on or off

Little light

Oh yeah

That 's a good idea

Yeah

Mm

He doesn't mind

He says I 've he says I 'm perfectly entitled he says he 's quite happy for me to do it but

But he wants to know whether it 's on or off though

He 's just

Yeah

In which case which invalidates it

Well I don't think it invalidates it

No i it 's not that

It 's just that it 's better for it if it 's sounding more natural

Yeah

But I mean this hasn't been on for fifteen minutes yet and I I I  and we know it 's on eh

I don't know 

I don't know how long it 's been on

Yeah

I know

But it 's some people do sound unnatural when they if they know a tape recorder 's there

Yeah sure

I don't think we do 

Or we just sound unnatural anyway

Well you might do

Well they 're going to have a hard time working out my accent eh 

D' you like my ring

It 's a tadda uh a claddagh rather

Claddagh ring

Claddagh

What does that mean



It 's a  it 's an Irish it originates from Galway

It 's really it used to be given as fourteenth-century redding wedding rings and nowadays blokes give it to girlfriends

And if you wear it that way up it means you 're going out with them

If you wear it the other way it means you 're not 

Incidentally

Nice innit isn't it

I had a claddagh ring long before you did

I 've got it on this necklace

See

What 's the stone

Sapphire and cubic zirconia round the outside

Yeah

But you can have it without stones 

Sapphire

Yeah

And what well where 's the zircon then

The cubic th the silver bits around the ah the side

The sparkly bits just round there

Oh I see

I don't think that 's a sapphire

But she 's 

'T is

She 's bragging

But then I 've had this about twenty years with the same thing on see

So

So

She 's not bragging

she was just showing it to me

I 'm just showing it to him

I 'm only joking

Hmm

Now I 've got 



Well that 's not a funny joke really at all

Oh I think so

Perhaps it isn't

Perhaps it isn't

No

You don't want any tea

All right

Uh did you say you 've got a uh a gauze I can put on this

Yes

I can find you some

I think

Yes 

Oh dear

This foot hasn't 

Has it it looks swollen that foot

It is yeah

How come

It was much more swollen two weeks ago when I did it

Uhm I was on the way to the pub one evening and stone cold sober decided to leap over this little wall 

I was just on the entrance to the pub and OK leapt over the wall

Fine yeah 

But on the other side there was this kerb and I just didn't look

and I landed on the edge of the kerb with that foot and the foot went reugh 

And it was really painful

and it all swelled up huge like a big balloon

And  luckily it didn't affect me walking or driving or cycling

This like this movement like this is fine

But it 's the sideways movement twisting movement  that  that 's out

 badly bruised

On the way to the pub not on the way back

Oh dear

Ssss

Oh God

Because when I did that I couldn't walk on my ankle

I did it in karate 

Then I had all black black bruising along all along the sides of my he heel

It 's uh I twisted it back like that sort of  like that and like that

Yeah

I had a lot of bruising in funny places where I didn't expect it

like I had oh yeah I had the whole swelling up here and bruising all around here

And then I had I had bruising around there like that 

Yeah yeah

It has gone down now but

Did you

Yeah

Did you

Did you put a have one of those tight bandages on it to keep give it support

Uhm I did for one day but it wasn't much use really

It wasn't cos it wasn't the kind of injury which  was uhm which needed that really 

No

You didn't have it X-rayed or anything

I 've been putting it uhm arnica on it every day so you might

Yeah I 've got I had I 've got arnica when I was doing karate

They said it 's meant to  clear up bruises and uhm



What a bad ankle or a bad head

Do you know I wouldn't mind doing psychology or something  child psychology

three-or-four-words

Do do sociology

Yeah

 

I wouldn't I wouldn't mind phonetics

Ask Linda

I mean if I told you honestly things can be really interesting and it is except for all the experiments you 've got to learn 

But it even bits of it are quite boring you know

Yeah

Yes 

Oh God we 've have to know all about uhm

You don't have to do your whole degree in it

I 'd be bored

Yeah

This is basically a compliment

I feel like doing something exciting 

Oh you 'd hate air hostessing

I know I would yeah

You 're right

I 'd never want to do that

My mum 's id my mum 's idea

Never it 's like a glorified waitress

Waitress

Glorified

It 's worse than a waitress

I know

I know 

I 'd hate it

 reading that uh you know that book you gave me on Stephen that Stephen King book as well

Oh yeah

Have you started it

Yeah the first story 's about

You star you haven't started the Ben Elton one

Yeah

The first story 's about this sort of uhm

Everyone disappears on an aeroplane except for seven people or something

Yeah

What in the the Stephen King one

Yeah 

Is it good

Yeah I I uhm  yeah I 'm about three quarters of the way through the first story

I just haven't had time to read it

What Ben Elton

Is it one of those stories

Oh no not Ben Elton

I haven't started that

I 'm saving that one

so it must be

That 's quite impressive actually saving something and reading Ki Stephen King first

Oh

Yeah

Saving it yeah

Mm

Well yeah Stephen King is your major favourite

Ben Elton second

Yeah I 've got

Yeah maybe

Maybe that was it

Yeah

No I was thinking I was saving Ben Elton till after Stephen King but it wasn't

I don't know

  

Mm

Why did you buy it

Well this was hoovered yesterday

I hoovered my bedroom cos Rosie was coming

I thought I 'd better show her a tidy room you know 

Yeah I 'm going to

I cooked Rosie dinner

Did I tell you

Yes I did didn't I mmm

Yes it was uh

Cordon Bleu

Yeah

Yeah

I sai I said to Peter

my God I I made this fatal mistake of saying to Rosie

I 'll cook

I did a quick window shop  at home 

Uh uh uh  crumble

I was going to get you an Arabic rug you know

Oh 

They 've got some nice rugs over there

You can get me a rug

A Arabic

Well they 've got some nice ones there

Have they

Yeah

I got my mum one

Mm

Did she like it 

Mm

Peter

Now what are they like there

They 're a bit

Are they the sort of uhm ones with people dancing three-or-four-words

Most of them are made in India but  but they are they are they 're nice rugs

Some really nice ones

Probably my brother 's kind of thing  

Yeah

My mum 's got about a million photos of rug making  

Well good ones good ones start from about 

I 'd say about a hundred and eighty upwards    

Mm

Hundred and eighty quid

No no no

You get good quality rug

Hundred and eighty 

How much is that

You get a good quality rug for about two twenty-five

Well how much is that in English

We don't understand the 

Right that 's thirty-five pounds

Yeah

Yeah 

About thirty odd pounds you 'll get what

And you

Back home you 'd pay

Well what you can get out there for about thirty-five back home you 'd pay over double that

Yeah



Yeah you would do

Treble it

Triple it

Triple it

Yeah

So you 'd definite you 'd definitely definitely get  things cheaper

Is it treble it or triple it

Depends on what you 're talking about

Triple the price or treble the price

Well you can honestly you you know

Treble I think

Treble 

Triple the price

Triple the price

I mean I can

Triple or 

Yeah I don't know

Look it up

Triple the price

No I can't be bothered 

You see things like that

I mean  there 're certain things that you can get cheaper out there

so I mean obviously if there 's anything that you want me to try and get you I can get it cheaper

What sort of things can you get cheaper

Oh I don't know

Some certain electrical goods like I mean like

I mean if I was to go to Dubai I can get things like electrical goods 

I 'm a student now

I 've got to economize 

Keep telling myself

So what 's happening to this tape actually

Well what happened is right the English uh

This is going to be on both sides of the tape cos I 've explained it  to my parents and my brother on the tape

You should have seen

Honestly they 're arguing like anything on Trivial Pursuit questions at the end of the ta

I think I 've wiped that off actually  cos it was so embarrassing 

Cos the question was was uhm what do the French call la Manche 

My brother goes  la Manche

The French call it la Manche you know

I said

well what they mean is the English Channel

and I

But well he was arguing the fact that what do the French call la Manche they call it la Manche you know

 

Yeah

The Channel yeah

Yeah

It 's true

Yeah

And then of course he uh

And I was going oh bloody hell 

This is a game John

Yeah

No no

But you can say the other way what do what do the French call uhm la Man

What is it in English that the French call la Manche

Yeah but the question didn't say that

And he was arguing that the question is really badly worded and therefore he should get it right if he says la Manche

Yeah but but you

No but no that 's not right because it can mean either 

You know it can mean what do the French call la la Manche 

Yeah but the French

And the answer is the Channel

Do you miss David then

The other

The other 

Uhm  I don't so much m miss him as you just miss you know that that nice secure feeling you get just having somebody around 

Not that I ever really got to talk to him but huh 

She was so sweet

Granny was really uhm 

My grandmother was really uhm helpful

Who was

You told her all about it then

Yeah I did

I had on the Monday night

uhm I rang she rang me up  and I told her all about it and she was she was just so understanding 

And it was like you know she wasn't eighty-three years old

she was you know

And she was just saying

oh yes well you know you must get over it as best as you can

it 's not the end of the world and stuff

And I said I know

But uh you know when I was talking to my cousin Emma uhm it was it was 

so I was you know I said it was well Monday when I went to work I said it was a week two weeks ago yeah two weeks ago last Monday

But I kept on feeling wobbly all day you know and I kept on feeling really miserable and thinking but you know

I thought

God this is if I 'm feeling like this because this is the first person that 's really

you know I meant something to him I was getting quite fond of him 

So I thought God damn it if I ever get close to walking up the aisle and then I get you know chucked in    I 'll be I 'll have a nervous breakdown

I know

It 's more humiliation I think when you walk up an aisle

Oh both both

Oh yeah

Yeah

Both

Can you imagine how awful

Mm

Yeah

My guess is sort of it was on the horizon and they just seemed when he came back from America that



It was right then 

Sorry

Well when it came when he came back from America just didn't seem as though he was 

I mean he 's got he 's got a lot of problems at work and with the gipsies and everything hasn't he so

Mm

Yeah 

So

But did it start start to go wrong when he came back from America then

No

I think it was uhm  as you said yeah that it was more uhm it was more gradual than that

As he said to me well we didn't seem to be going anywhere fast

Gradual

He said that He said that

He said that

So

and I didn't

and I I felt like turning round and sort of saying well

you know well whose fault is that

You know I 'm trying

what 's he doing

And he admitted to being lazy

uhm  you know in a relationship it takes two

You too have to work at a relationship

It 's not easy

Must be your bloody fault

This is a brilliant film

We 've got to see it  

You what

What 's it called

Truly Madly Deeply

He comes  He died but he 's come back as a ghost and they sort of fall in love again

But it 's really it 's very good

Oh

That 's charming 

OK

What 's the Spielberg one that one that is the a-few-words-while-yawning

When 's that on then

Is it on T V or a film

I dunno don't know

They 're showing them soon

But it 's still on  it 's still on at the cinema I think but I don't know why they 're showing it on tel television

It 's still on at the cinema

Where 're you going to Tiggy

Don't 

Oh dear

Is he some new

Do you remember Peter

He 's still yawning 

Do you yawn 

Mm

Yeah

Who 's he

So what 's this video

Where 's this video

What 's that

The one that you had

Is it this one



Did you buy it

No

I rented it 

Oh you rented it 

I see

Right 

Mm 

What 's it called

Love Story

No no

Don't put it on now

but you know 

 

It 's called Somewhere in Time 

They have it in a in the Video in Camden Road

Oh right

Mhm

Oh do they

Oh right

Where did you hear it from then

uhm where did I hear about it

Yeah

I saw it years ago

Penny

my friend Penny

And we loved it and I 'm going to

I sat there twice

Watched it twice

and we  we cried so much

It 's just really sad

It 's brilliant

I mean it 's about  if you like 

It 's about 

Love Story

Mm 

Really oh ah

Is it

Oh very famous picture that 

Psychoanalysis

Yes

Something to do with  uhm  I dunno don't know 

just something to do with the  

Is it

Mm

Oh this is The Medusa Touch that Ian 's taping

Is he is he is he taping it now

Yes he is

Yeah 

Is it on 

It 's not It 's not

you 're not taping it

Mhm

Isn't it

No

You just fiddled with the machine didn't you

Ooh  shit

No 

Are you sure it 's taping

It is taping

Yes

It is taping

The red button 's on

No wonder I couldn't take it out

Is it  flashing

No

But it is on

It 's definitely on

It 's definitely on because that 's what happens to my one 

That 's the same as it is with mine

 you don't you don't see the counter going round

There 's no counter

No 

The same as my one

Mine 's a J V C as well 

Exactly what it does

Yeah good

What

it 's the same model

Uhm very similar

I didn't hear it go on though

That 's why 

It 's very quiet

isn't it 

Oh I know

I know this

It 's Richard Burton 

I 'm sure Richard Burton stars in this

I think

Does he 

No what was the one that

yeah that he uhm  he  he survives  a plane crash or something

and he has these amazing powers these telepathic powers  uhm

and he starts making things happen

uhm and his power grows so much that he starts to blackmail people

uhm in the end it is the the government realises he 's really dangerous 

But I think it 's obviously not this one 

But I 'm sure it is

I 'm sure it 's the one Medusa Touch

Did we see it before The Medusa Touch

I 've never seen it

I 'm sure it is

You can borrow the last one

Yes Richard Burton

Yes

Yes Richard Burton

Yes Richard Burton 

He has He has He has psychic abilities

And he influences  he influences certain things

He gets He gets 

He gets hospitalised and he nearly dies 

Yes

Yes

You 're right

Oh

Who 's killing who

Who 's killing who

No 

Pity the sound just

No it 's a bad influence 

Do we ever find out who  did hit him

I can't remember

but he

Well uh that 's part of it that punished

It 's a good film

isn't it

It 's a bloody good film

It is

It is

It 's very good

It 's actually very very spooky

It 's not spooky spooky but uhm

 

 better be taped

uhm well  I don't I don't mind at all

Rather than start watching it at eleven o'clock

Oh god it isn't is it actually

 a quarter to eleven

It 's actually very good

but it 's it 's a shame because in in the end it kind of 

Hasn't it a good ending

uhm  yes it has

It has got a good ending but you kind of think oh no it 's not you know

Gordon Jackson

Yeah

Derek Jacobi

Yeah

It 's a good It 's what I

 don't worry

What 's on the other side

I mean   

Oh look

She looks awful 

This is uh Brazil

Oh God Brazil 's just as depressing

Oh The Boys from Brazil

No Brazil 

It 's a very very good And again that 's another very good film 

But  it 's a real shame because it 's  it 's very peculiar 

It 's a very weird psychological film 

Oh Brazil one

Yeah

It 's It 's futuristic

It 's set in the future

There was a very weird film about some stranger you know 

I never saw it though

Was there

Mm

It 's very very good 

Uh it 's very difficult to understand

You have to see it once and then you have to see it a second time separately to suss it out 

But I like I like uhm  I like him jumping and 

Oh my God

Oh there are the boys getting out as well

No because they take like it 's set in the year two thousand where the State controls

It 's rather like you know Nineteen Eighty-Four that the State controls everybody and they have spies everywhere 

uhm and the information technology has grown so much  that they 're ruled by information technology 

And he works in the information technology

He works oh like all markers

It is i It 's very good but it 's such a

Because he tries basically he tries to beat the system 

And uhm he can't beat the system and he gets you know he 's on the run from the police 

uhm 

Have you seen it before Caroline

I have never seen it

still I really 

really it 's not my sort of film 

But it it 's very similar to Nineteen Eighty-Four in that you know there 's like the baddies and the goodies 

uhm  it 's weird

It really is 

Because he gets he 's  trying to  kick the system 

It makes him  unhinges him and he just gets weirder and weirder and the film gets weirder and weirder 

It 's just so

It 's futuristic but it 's you know 

Mm

I 've heard of Boys from Brazil but I 've never heard of Brazil

No no

Boys from Brazil

Did you ever see Nineteen Eighty-Four

Yeah 

I was a kid 

I I walked I walked out

Oh that awful death when they fell through the window through the glass

Little Clare and I just swept out of the film

It was so boring 

Was it about a school

Nineteen Eighty-Four 

Futuristic

there 's a big man

there 's

there 's

What was it called 

There was someone watching over them or something

They had to

Very regimented very dull



I can't remember that

What

It wasn't George Orwell 

Yes

It was George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-Four made into a film

With uhm  Hurt

John Hurt

John Hurt 

Did you see that one with Arnold Schwartzenegger Total Recall

That 's a strange film

No I haven't seen that

I want to see that

Very good film actually

Have you seen Kindergarten Cop yet

It 's brilliant

I think he 's very good actually

I really like him

And Twins

Yeah

He 's very good 

Total Recall is definitely a film to watch

It 's terribly exciting

Yeah

You have to watch that Yeah you have to watch that twice because it 's got such backwards and forwards

Oh yes it 's such a strange film

Kindergarten Cop was lovely

Yes

It is

Very good

I enjoyed that 

three-or-four-words

Yeah

The screen 's all over the place now 

And look

they all wear exactly the same thing 

Mhm

Like Bugsy Malone isn't it

Yeah

That new film with Joey Jodie Foster 's looks quite good

Little  Man Tate or something

I like her

She 's great

I want to see that one uh Frankie Frankie and

Jo Johnnie

Johnnie 

So you 're primarily going to see her

Well now I am

I think for years and years I 've always wanted to go to Australia and I 've always kept  very good ties with Jeremy since we broke up 

I met him a lot after my father had died and I think  there is something  something  about that actually

I 'd always wanted to go to Australia

And I met this Australian in London and I lived with him for a year and went to Australia 

But something happened

And I don't this is the big thing I don't know

I 've never understood and this is what 's caused a lot of problems and all 

I felt we had to break up and that we just couldn't stay together

and sort of our sex life disappeared

and for  years we were just completely platonic 

And it was quite 

It was very nice but all the while I kept thinking this is wrong this is wrong it shouldn't be like this 

So I sort of split it up but it was really down to sort of  transpacific and transatlantic

It was all by the phone and stuff

That 's how really why I went to Australia so there 'd be time 

Because I wanted I think it 's because I wanted to do something 

I wasn't sure why I was doing it 

Couldn't explain it

Only I was trying to protect everybody by 

So it got quite str  stressful but we never got to hate each other

It 's never been like that

But  after all these years it 's sort of slowly taking its course

But  I still can't let go

I keep

Even at Christmas I ask him 

Oh I suppose it 's a question lots of people ask each other

D' you D' you really think  we could ever get back together again

D' you really think

And he said well I don't know

I  You can never say that

And I suppose you can't

Mm

Yeah

Mm

Mm

Mm 

So he was over at Christmas when you spoke to him

Mm

No

I spoke to him because I always speak to him at Christmas and birthdays

I mean they 've really become sort of about my family sort of thing

Mm right

Yeah

And you asked him whether he thought that you might get back together

Yes

I mean I always  I 'm very frightened of losing him so 

Yeah

I was sort sort of asking him again

Yes 

Cos you want to get back together 

I don't think I do because I nearly emigrated to Australia and then I didn't

I started to think did it

And I I sort of thought ah this is  this is when everything sort of started for the second time just started going wrong

I met someone else before that and I just said this is it 

It 's not really Jeremy

But Jeremy was always there in the background

He was always 

Only I I wonder

I don't know

I 've just thought this thing 's been going round with it 

He was a bit of a father replaceable  because it happened so soon afterwards

I 'm not sure 

And that 's when I 'm seeing the Marriage Guidance woman and she suggested that perhaps  having sex with your father isn't really i e that 's what you were feeling which is why 

Only sometimes I think since we 've

perhaps we just  

I was only twenty-four or something

I was still very young  

And it 's like I don't believe  my feelings

and because we got on so well I thought I thought you just had to hate someone when you split up from them and not to 

Yes

Yeah

Mm

Where did you pick that up from 

Oh probably television I think 

People always

No I 've

although 

Perhaps from home I

I don't know because I didn't want to be unhappy I thought 

We had a very loving relationship but it wasn't everything you know

he wanted physical love as well and I couldn't give that

It wasn't him it was me who was at fault 

That 's the big problem

isn't it 

Well I suppose that I because I mean there are people who do have platonic relationships

I suppose I didn't want a platonic relationship 

It was me who didn't want  the physical relationship with Jeremy  but I didn't know why

Yes 

Yes

So you say because you 

You say you wanted 

Let me go back a few 

You didn't want sex

Oh I 'm quite a busy  and I I don't I wouldn't want to live with someone who I didn't have any sex life with

I 'd prefer to have everything

I don't believe

Oh so it wasn't that you were disinterested in sex

It was that you were disinterested in sex with  Jeremy

Yeah 

You see that 's happened on and off with John and then I sort of panic and think oh my God it 's happening again

It 's you know

Uhm

Yeah

You say it went on  which presumably means it 's on again

Well it 's only a year but it 's sort of go goes off for several months

I don't But I don't understand

You don't know the process how you turn off how you turn back on 

But I think it 's a very positive sign that you that you repair or you  you get back together or you  you resume the sexual relationship

I wonder what  going

Well we 're working very hard  because it 's me again when something happens 

You say you were working very hard

I mean I uh I 'm very conscious of it and I sort of really have to try 

I mean I don't force myself to doing anything but I sort of think  you know wh what 's going on in your mind

What 's the matter

What are you 

Mm

All this to yourself 

Yes

I tried to talk to Peter a bit more but  I don't fully understand it myself 

But with Jeremy I never spoke at all

Didn't realise

I sort of like shut up shop

And he never asks any questions and yet he still went on 

Probably had my periods

Probably very weary

Just sort of went on like that and he never 

And eventually obviously after  a little while and after a few months it sort of started to come out

And then I just never spoke about it

But we really didn't  even touch each other I mean even put our arm around each other and sort of I always moved away

It was very 

It 's quite a lot of

I I still get like that sometimes with Mary but I can see it happening so I sort of stop everything 

You know what are you doing

what are you

I don't think I 'm quite against it

I 'm just trying to sort of  protect myself almost

but I don't know what from

Right 

That 's interesting 

I would ask you what is it from 

Stay with the relationship between you and John  for the moment

uhm I did hear what you said at the beginning which is  not to  look at  the relationship with  uhm  Jeremy and Jane and where that 's going

But at least you still have some hope not  at a conscious level but enough to ask him

do you think we could ever get back together 

Yeah

I remember at Christmas because that that seems

I get really  I get I was used to describe them to Heather as like panic attacks

I get really panicky

And oh God I 've lost everything

I 've lost everything

And then I 'd make a phone call to Australia just sort of on the pretext of

how are you 

Then I always have this thing about

if you ever got married I 'd be absolutely devastated 

You know 

I really uh

And it 's funny

I suppose it 's because it 's so final

If someone was married to me then  they 're untouchable

but when it 's sort of like just  living with someone like this it seems so  although I don't consciously work like that

But subconsciously you think

if I haven't got a real  if you 're available 

I mean it 's that sort of thing

But for me to get married I don't think I could ever do it 

I never wanted to get married so it 'd be quite a big thing

So if someone else got married I 'd think gosh maybe he must

it would mean quite a lot to the children

So if someone else got married I 'd think gosh maybe he must

it would mean quite a lot to the children

Yeah

And yet you got engaged 

Yes

But w  we only did it  it was very  because he couldn't  he didn't really want to come to England again

It was about seven years 

and I didn't really at that stage want to move to Australia

It was almost 

We wanted to be able to be free to move between 

It was almost conveniency or something

cos what else could we do

I suppose we had to get engaged now because it 's the only way we 're going to see each other

It 's very  strange

But at that point  it doesn't give you any particular rights

It would give me Australian citizenship I mean when you go 

Only if you 're getting married 

You 've got to get

If you 're going to get married it was sort of all right

But I just  stepped out at the last minute

But I did it really badly

I mean that 's 



Sure

I heard you say I never wanted to get married 

And yet  you got engaged 

I mean even that was simply a way of  confirming your status in Australia

that is a reason to want to get married

Not the most romantic reason in the world but

Mm 

I didn't like it there

I didn't  I thought oh God  and everything started churning around here 

Philippa got all excited

and oh where will you get married over here

And I thought  oh God I can't

It was 

Probably that

People would say you 've just got cold feet but it was more than that

It was really a sort of panic

I thought I couldn't stop it

It was getting

Yes

Mm 

Oh but you did 

Yes because I had to

I just thought I can't 

Obviously it only caused lots of  stress but

Mm 

But that was less of a stress than some  that it would have caused when you got married

Oh I think so

Yes

I mean we would have been  we would have both been very unhappier

Although I don't think we would have been unhappy actually but I think perhaps  for me

I don't know how Jeremy felt inside

but for me I would have felt unhappy enough

And I had visions of having affairs just for  the physical s the physical relationships

Mm

I just thought I couldn't live like that 

Yes 

So again we come back to this question about 

you have physical wants desire 

but first Jeremy  and now Peter sometimes 

Somehow it doesn't fit for you

You You pull away

You You don't want to be  close

And even if it 's not sexual and even if it 's a  a friendship  would you still  instinctively pull away

But I was managing to counteract that  with John

and I couldn't  reason of realising

Mm

Yeah

But it sounds as if you 're fighting with yourself 

Sometimes I mean it 's sort of just 

And people always seem to say things like

have you ever been raped 

Well now as far as I know I 've never been raped or anything

but that 's sort of how  some of my girl friends sort of describe it sometimes

It sounds as though you 've been attacked or something 

But that 's sometimes how I feel

I feel really  almost as if he was trying to violate me

It 's horrible



Mm

Mm 

Yeah 

There are other ways of doing violence to people particularly to women  than  than raping

 

Not everybody who is who is experiencing what you are experiencing has had to have been raped

It 's not the only thing that can happen to you 

Like your friends I 'm wondering whether there was some abusive experience 

You know it really upsets me and I don't know why

Sure 

Let 's stay with that 

How 're you feeling 

Before we continue I think it 's important that you 're not going to let me abuse you 

I have no  wish no intention  of doing anything abusive to you

So  if we 're going to work together  on the possibility that you had a bad experience at some time it 's important that  you don't perceive me as following that  through

Because if so if you ever want to say stop  I 'm not comfortable  I 'll stop and won't go any further

How 're you doing 

Oh  not too bad really with my

It 's pretty difficult 

I seem to get slower and uh  I don't walk too well nowadays 

Anyway what can one expect

Yes

No

Do you go out regularly or or

Well only when I need shopping 

And not then if it 's a nasty day

Yes

Yeah 

Because at the moment you don't have any help at home do you

No

I don't have any help at all 

Never had any

I don't need it yet

No

But

You don't need it at the moment

Not yet I don't  

I I might 

I 'll be grateful if you lay it on when I do

Yes 

So you 're not at the stage of needing uh meals on wheels or anything like that

Oh no no no no

No no

You do your own cooking

Yes always

Yes

And d' you d' you have a  reasonable diet d' you think 

Well I eat one good cooked meal a day of meat and vegetables  

I don't have much for breakfast uhm and  just a sandwich at lunchtime usually

I do uh definitely have one properly cooked meal freshly cooked meal a day

Yes

Yes

In the evening

Yeah

That 's good

I mean I think it 's essential

I don't always feel I 'm like eating it or wanting it but I do it

Yeah

Yes

Well we 'll just check your blood pressure 

It 's lower than last time

Hm

It 's lower than last time

Is it lower

That 's good isn't it 

Yeah

Yeah

 Does that mean we can drop some of the tablets

Probably not

I thought you 'd say that  

No

It 's a It 's a very healthy level now  so we 'll we 'll continue with the same tablets 

Have you uh Have you got any of them now or d' you need the whole lot 

No

I need the whole lot

Yep 

Including the the uhm  indigestion ones

OK

And I need s sixty of those because I take one every night

Yeah 

The indigestion is worse at night is it 

Well I used to get it very badly at night but if I take one of these tablets it 's they help

It helps yeah mhm 

Mm 

I do get a lot of wind during the day uhm sometimes 

Yeah 

How 's your sister

Well touch wood

at the moment she 's  she 's quite a bit better

And it 's been going on now for  about seven months that she 's been all right so

That 's good 

Is that a longer period than usual

She 's quite happy  that you mentioned it 

I 'm frightened every day when I ring her

But she 's  getting on really

So far so good

Yes

That 's good 

OK 

Thank you very much 

And that 's all you need at the moment 

Yes

That 's right

 in the ambulance

Yes at the moment touch wood 

OK

What 's the problem

Well I was I was passed to you from my doctor up in Rutland

And he suggested that as soon as I got here I came and see saw you 

And  uh it 's about uh my nose and  something about a  to me 

I 'm the patient and as I don't know much about it uhm he briefly explained what needed to be done 

Uhm it 's a problem with from when I was born uhm 

There 's a bone in my nose that 's slightly bent  uhm and it 's progressively caused slight breathing problems

Yes

Yeah

Yeah

So you 've got a deviated septum 

Is that what they called it

Yeah yeah 

Yes

Mm 

And you suffer from mild asthma is that right

That 's right

I Well it it sort of relates to hay fever

So uhm towards the end of the summer I 've now got a little breathing trouble 

And And it 's not helping at all any more

The last few years it 's got worse  and because I can't breathe through my nose at all  during the summer uhm that brings on the asthma

And over the last couple of years I 've had a uhm a glandular fever type virus which was 

they 've been unable to find out what it is

but I haven't taken it at all 

Uhm  and it seems uh the doctor s the last doctor said that it was quite a lot to do with breathing through my nose because I couldn't breathe through my nose during the night when I 'm sleeping 

So I was breathing through my mouth

So I was getting a sore throat

I had my tonsils removed

It made some difference for a while 

Uhm

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah

A sore throat

Well how old were you when the tonsils were taken out

Well I had them uh taken out uhm  in January

This year

Yeah 

And that was at home

Uhm that was near 

That was in  Hospital

Yeah 

OK

Well I think the simplest thing is that if we refer you to the uhm  E N T hosp specialist and uh see what they can do about it

That 's what I assumed  right

OK then 

Now uh the rest of your health is OK

I mean are you generally well

I feel fine

Uhm the the virus seems to have cleared up but I have last couple of weeks I 've been having a lot of trouble

I was getting very lethargic again which is the trouble I had  uhm  before the summer

Did they do blood tests to see whether you had glandular fever

They They did one blood test and it didn't  

Uhm but he he said there were further tests

but he said that it wasn't worth taking any further because even if they did find out what exactly it was there was nothing they could do about it 

And so it didn't seem worth

It was negative was it

Yeah 

Well glandular fever tends to run its own course

There isn't anything actually you can do about it

That 's right

Yeah yeah

Uhm but I I think what I must have had uh was like a flu-type something or other uhm which is like  and

Yeah

Let 's have a look at your throat just now 

Right 

It doesn't hurt you to swallow

No

Not at all

OK 

Well I 'll write to the Royal National Throat Nose and Ear  and ask one of the consultatives there to send you an appointment  and they 'll have a look and see if you need the operation

Mm mm mm

Right

OK 

Right

And I 'll be sent to sent to this address yeah

Sent to Ramsey yes

OK

You 're going away for Christmas presumably

Yes 

Yeah

I 'll be back I 'll be back after Christmas

OK

Then that should be OK

Right

OK

OK then

Thanks very much

Right 

Bye

Uhm  how 're you doing

Uhm I 'm fine

No problems

No

No

So you 've come to  re renew the pill

Uh re

Yeah

Thought so

OK 

Now you 're taking uh Marvellon

Mhm

And you 're happy with it

Yes 

I just need to check your blood pressure 

 

And the other one as well  



Right 

You 're second year now aren't you

Yes

A lot of tests

Uhm we 've got quite a few this week

Yeah



That 's OK

It 's normal 

Mhm 

I 'm doing a project actually for my second year on uhm side effects of the pill 

What are you doing

Are you 

That should be interesting

Yeah 

Have you got the uh John Tredegar book 

Where is it now

I 'm not sure of any books right now 

I think the best one to start with is this 

Tells you all about him



Yes 

Have you had any of the uhm infections going round

Uhm I haven't even had flu yet actually

No

Mm

That 's lucky 

A form to sign 

We 'll just register you for contraceptives for another year 



I want a pen

Have you got a pen

Mhm

Just put your name address  and sign at the bottom there 

Just down there the other the other bit doesn't matter because  in fact you 've seen us 

OK thanks

Mhm

Uh no other problems

No

No

No 

Here you are then

Thanks

Keep you going for six months 

Yes I think so

OK 

Right

Bye bye

Uhm now the last time you came I sent you for some tests 

And uh this was for  function 

In fact it 's normal 

So that 's not the problem 

Are you still having the tremor

Yes

Right

Yes

Most certainly

It 's And it 's there nearly all the time or or

Yeah all the time

All the time

All the time except

Yeah 

Does it prevent you doing certain things 

It can make some things harder 

Yeah 

Like what

Uhm  

Yes

Things like that

Well like changing a plug or something like that

Changing a plug

Yeah

That 's all right

It 's just minor things 

When you notice the  the person that sat next to me  in the drawing classes

Yeah

Yeah

So you avoided art and things at school

Yeah

Because of this you mean or

No

No

Yes

Can't abide art 

Now what are you studying

You 're  doing archaeology

And it doesn't affect your  uh academic work now at the moment 

No 

And how about your general health apart from this 

At the moment now I 've got a cold and things  and   

Yeah

But uh

What because of infections and things

Yeah

It 's colds

Yeah

Uhm I think that 's just being with so many people

Yeah 

But you haven't been in the past in hospital for anything

No

No 

Now your parents are they alive and well

Uh yes

How How old is your father

Uhm  I don't know exactly

He 's coming up to sixty 

Nearly sixty 

And he 's in good health

Uhm he 's just come out of hospital with kidney stones

Kidney stones 

Is he treated for blood pressure or anything like that

No

No 

And your mother how old is she

Uh mid fifties

Fifty-five 

Is she well

Yeah

She 's very well 

Have you any brothers or sisters

I 've got a sister

How old is she

Twenty-six 

What does she do

Uhm she 's a lecturer in business studies 

And also well

Yes 

Have you ever uh taken any sort of medical advice about this before about the tremor

You haven't

No

No 

Just put your hands out this way 

It 's quite noticeable isn't it

Mm 

Nails are a bit battered

What happens

Do you chew them

Oh yeah 

 Right 

Well I think the best thing is to refer you to a neurologist  have this checked out  uhm  and see whether that whether there is anything significant about it

I think probably the it 's what 's called an idiopathic tremor which just comes on has no obvious cause

And uh  we we will find out a bit more about it when I send you to 

So I 'll do that

and they 'll send you an appointment at your address

It probably won't be till next term 

You 're going to be at  college

That 's all right

Uhm I won't be there over Christmas

No

No

But after Christmas break 

After the Christmas break yes

Well I 'll write to them and uh ask them to send you an appointment

OK

OK

Thank you

Right

Bye

Bye

The greatest bullfighters of all have had to be gored

Yeah and you know why because they 've got closer to the horns 

that is what I think

John wrote something once about what I did

He said  he plays very close to the horns you know

that 's

You you in war you play on the horns you know

You 're not the sword after all

you 're not  you know

The matador in a way is a glamorous figure he 's a

he 's dressed

he 's like  pampered  and prepared himself as uh a theatrical  kind of image you know

but in war photography you know there is no 

There is a theatre in war you know

there is a theatre

there is no question

You have the principal players the scenery you know the whole thing  but it 's not  there as an entertainment you know

it 's there  as a tragedy you know

so there is an element of of theatre because the they 're all element elements

There are many icons in the war you know

there are many scenes of religious depictions of people cradling the dying people praying people

even me you know and I 'm the greatest atheist of all time knows when to become the Judas four-words-and-laugh

You know you know when to suddenly 

You know I 'm not a religious person but I do remember a certain religious instructor at school about the cock crowing you know when those mortars came

it was like the cock crowing to me you know 

and I used to kind of say you know please t please God get me out of this

you know  real scary

So uhm  the searching of one 's soul and the depths that one would go to to  you know  revisit the past

that 's your life as as you feel as if it 's now coming to a close when those you know  those uh  one twenty mortars used to be walking towards you

That 's an army expression as they say they were walking them 

we walked the mortars  to the target you know 

And as they were getting nearer and nearer and nearer that 's when you started  asking a lot of questions

You 'd say you know hang about what 's this why am I here this

Is this photography you know

this is what I want you know 

So  it was a  it was part of a learning

that 's what it was wasn't it really

It was part of a learning

Exactly

Yes

Yeah

There are a number of things

You must be running out of time

I 'm sorry it 's gone on so long

No no I 'm not I 'm not running out of time 

Are you cold

It 's freezing

Can we go upstairs

Is that

Yes go upstairs

Do you want a cassette 

My still life studio is as big as this room actually

Now what 's nice about here you 've got the very light source  to do still life 

If I had that light coming the way you 've got it here I 'd be doing it all the time

But I 'm afraid I 've got like a little garage and it 's only this big 

but what happens is I 've have to put the stuff against the wall and get back the other side

I can't get to the side of it and it 's  a nightmare

One of my favourite photographers is a great

He does he is a sort of artist photographer

Well he does these incredible complicated setups and he had a two-up and two-down down the road  and he had a hole in the banisters and he used to shoot through one room through the hole into the other

Yeah

Yeah

Roof

Oh I see



I know he 's uh

he 's got my sympathy really

because you know for me 

I 'm winding down you know my operation because you know you can't be gung ho forever  you know

but on the other hand you 've got to keep a certain amount of stubbornness to keep the energy going

You know I 've got injuries to my leg my arm

I can't carry things with my arm

I can't sleep properly ever cos I when I go to bed at night I I have to st my arm won't straighten you see

so I lay in bed at night

and I 've got an arm that 's like like that you see

It looks as if I 'm waiting for someone to give me something like a cup of tea or something 

And he sits there with Bill Wyman

you know it 's a wankers ' table that 

and uh he sits there with Bill Wyman you see and that 's it

and they actually asked you to get out of it did they

 Yes it is

yes

Uh that 's right yeah

but it 's uh

Who was that Johnny Gold the owner

Yeah so that was uh you know

Was this a Friday night then 

Uhm  yeah it was it wasn't it was 

it was a the guy I was with that had to get out of it 

So uhm you know that

I would have wished I just

I wish I 'd just gone up to him

and like are you Terry O'Neill

And he  yes fuck off 

One of the happiest memories in my life

Bastard

 even worse

 I 've done it for you haven't I

I mean you know

I mean he 's supposed to be one of my my great mates you know you behind my back he was  slagging me

You see he told somebody I was weak 

You see he was he tried to pull my mate 's wife one night in Tramps

My my mate Peter is married to Cleo Goldsmith one of the Goldsmith family right and he says to

Terry pulled her aside and said why are you with these two

And I 'm supposed to be one of his mates

And why are you with these two

they 're both weak people 

And she came back and told her husband you see

She said you know

So anyway  and then and then he rang me up and I wouldn't answer the phone and I picked it up and said you 've been telling people I 'm fucking weak you know

So anyway  then I found out he was going out with a woman that I was going with you know 

and uh we broke up

but instead of uh keeping away he was like

So I just got in a cab went round and laid him out you know 

It was costly mind you but it was like

 after that was about eighteen months ago

and d' you know what

the papers have been ringing up this week about it saying

A bloke rang up the other day from the Express and said uhm  oh uhm  I just want to confirm uh uh about you and Terry O'Neill

and I said hang on a minute why are you bothering me about this

He he said said did you

I said I 'm not saying anything to you about my private life I said

and I don't know what you 're talking about anyway

He said 

I said and if you call yourself a journalist I said

He said oh I 'm a journalist

So if you 're a journalist go and do some real fucking journalism then

He said I didn't pick this phone up to be insulted

I said well fuck off then  and put the phone straight down on him you know 

How dare they

I know they have a 

I mean that 's

If if I was a weaker person you know they 'd chew your arse 

It 's the most bizarre statement

I mean what

So so what happened is you shot you shot a

Boy

Sorry I 'm not a great lover of dogs

Shall I lock him up

No no don't lock him

 don't take offence about my snub rejection

it 's just

Uhm so you shot a job that he did that they didn't like then

They didn't like his pictures yeah but then I did the pictures

but the record it was a record company

and the record company said why 're you doing it

Terry O'Neill has done it you know

Mmm oh you mean the pop group didn't like it

No no they they didn't they did Terry O'Neill 's session and it was such garbage they got him to reshoot

But like the record company then refused to pay me without having seen the pictures

They said Terry O'Neill 's done it you know 

As if that that would sort of uh

So have they used your pictures in the end of the day 

No they didn't actually  which is uh

but don't mind that 's uh that that 's that that 's a part

that 's part of

I mean uh that that being a professional in that profession is like it 's the bottom

It 's the absolute

They 've used his picture yeah

That was probably the record company 's decision

It 's not worth arse-licking all round

I mean it 's the big arse-lickers uhm

It 's

I mean I I I realise that like in some respects it 's the only way of quite a few years of my life

but I mean  you know I 'm open to change

and so that 's

Well you will

How old are you

you 're not very old anyway

Twenty-nine

 I mean you know twenty-nine

He 's totally uncompromising though in the way he approaches towards other people

it 's

Yeah but I am too

you see I wouldn't compromise myself

I mean I I don't do anything that you know that I don't want to feel ashamed of you know 

but I I mean like uh talking about  smoking last year Mark George the guy who does all my gets me work hasn't got much lately

but  he offered me a job that I could have earned forty grand 

forty grand

and boy did I need forty grand

who doesn't you know

But it was to go to Siberia for six weeks and photograph  a car rally

and I thought hang on what 's this all about

Who 's going to pay for it

I said it 's not to do with cigarettes is it

He said I don't know I 'll get back to you

Of course he knew

you know he doesn't get

He 's not going to say forty grand for what is he 

He 's not going to say he knew

and he came

and he said are you were right about that

and I said no I 'm not doing it you know

So  anyway uhm  we 'll forget the socialising  uhm and the enemies and we 'll get on where we where we  were before

Yeah





Mmm

 telling the truth 

Has to be cigarettes yeah

Yes 

But I 'm pleased that you you know you actually  recognise a prat when you see one you know  

But I have this this little shit

my little son lives in his house you know with this woman you know and I had to take my son back there on Sunday 

I had him with me in Somerset  

I feel like doing all the windows when I leave you know

Oh my God

 shit

Oh that must be difficult 

So we were rambling away downstairs

I 'll tell I 'll tell you wha what we 'll get back to uh 

In in your book you were writing about the mandolin player 

Maybe you know like uh 

I don't know if it isn't asking you too much to 

It was extraordinary what you went through to to get the picture in those circumstances

Oh yeah Beirut

I 'm just wondering how quickly I can read this book 

I think probably the thing to do is to look rush through the introduction  and then maybe look at the index

Is there an index

Mm

There is

and all the chapters are selfcontained as well

Oh yes

Mm 

So it should be fairly easy

You needn't read every chapter

Yeah that 's right 

This is something that Diane was saying that there 's so much work that 's got to be done that uh we we won't have time to read any books unless we particularly want to read the books

The best thing to do is to is to turn straight to the index and look through the index then then look through the pages that you know are contained in the index

Yeah

The intro 's extremely readable on that

Mm

I think that 's probably what I 'll do

Ah this is a good bibliography in here

Mm 

So what 's your essay

Just writing a critique of one book  on feminist theology 

Mhm 

Yeah

I think that sounds like a good one to do actually 

I 'd like to write something on process theology 

I might like to write something on Mortmann as well

I find him quite appealing 

 

I 've lost him 

Mhm

No

That 's my stuff

That 's mine 



I was quite happy with that

I was quite pleased when I knocked that out

I thought I 'd done  I thought I 'd done quite well

Oh it 's awful when you 're pleased with something and

Yeah but it 's only a phase

I was quite disappointed when I got my Wogan stuff back 

Hm 

I think that 's a bit unfair

I got a I got a low B  which I was OK but I mean  Kathy and Juliet and everybody got B or B plus

I was quite disappointed

And there were some that got a C but not the people I hang around with 

Mm

Mm

Yeah

You may think you know like B minus

I was awfully disappointed

but it got us quite a good grade

Yeah

I was a bit  

I think I 'd done  and you did as well

We just got the wrong uh  took the wrong approach really

Mm

Yeah

Yeah

Uh I think that was a bit unfair 

How come you gotta 've got to do twelve 

There 's only six

Only do six essays not twelve

Hang on 

Let 's have a look at the list 

Mm

Well

So that 's going to be one

More like a 

Well you 've done one already

Schleiermacher or whatever his name is

I 've done one mm

Schleiermacher

Schleiermacher

Apparently that means veil maker  according to your Mum

Oh

Oh right

Schleier is a veil 

So you 've got another five to do 

That 'll be one

I 'd uh like to do one on process

And write a critique of one work of feminist theology 

Like to do something on Mortmann

Is The Myth of God Incarnate a dangerous book if I thwack somebody over the head with it

We haven't we haven't Yeah we haven't done that one yet

Depends how big the book is 

Yes 

Oh dear 

How about liberation theology used as a Marxist analysis of society

Yes that one w that would be quite an interesting one to do

Yeah that would be an interesting one to do 

As it 's a major conceptual tool

Mm

Brian and I do our  assignments together so I generally end up writing half an essay on  theology while he just demonstrates it 

Which I Which reminds me I 've got I 've almost finished this book

I 'll I 'll hand it on over to you

Oh you have

God Language and Scripture

It 's really quite interesting

Very interesting

Well I say quite very interesting 

I forget which one it is now

One of the  synoptic gospels is written in more or less colloquial Greek  sort of as it would be spoken rather than literary Greek

Forget which one it was now

Oh

Mark

Either that one or Matthew or Luke

Sort of a chatty chatty style 

Hmm 

Rather you than me

Mm 

There are some of these things we 've not come across yet

What do you think the term anamne anamnesis means

Got any idea

I think so

Well that 's ideal you see

If you put that it I 've no idea you 've actually answered the question

You can't even say it

Mm

Yes

It doesn't actually say what is it

It says what what do you think

The trouble is you 've got to say  you 've got to say uh what do you think in in a thousand words or in fifteen hundred words

I don't know  then another don't know 

Oh mm

Mm 

I could probably do that in a thousand words

Yeah well

Mm

Looking at the question  and the unfamiliar word I would deduce that I had very little knowledge of this subject

In fact looking further into it  on and on and on

I think   you could bring uh Irish myth into it somehow as well

And on and on and on

Yes I could

Yes

According to Irish legend

I remember now 

You 're going to be transcribing all of this are you

Yes 

Yes 

Some poor little soul 's got to do it



So  to say any  nasty words then

No no 

We 're not to mention We 're not to ment mention the fact the tape recorder 's on or it ruins things

And talk fairly quickly yeah

Really

Oh

However 



What

were you told that

Yes 

Yes we were told that 

Oh

A tad unfortunate

Mm

Never mind

Oh Mortmann 's mentioned in here so I can use this for  an essay

What was the one  that required

I don't think if it was just Schleiermacher

Oh yes

Indicate with examples how the theology of Ewige Mortmann has been influenced by major events of the twentieth century

Feminist theology

A major event of the twentieth century

Yeah

She has been influenced by that

I could uhm get you that other book when I stay at Hilda 's if you 're near U C 

The book that

they were  two books sold as one

Yes

Mm

Yes

It 'd be interesting to look at

And this Walter 's special 

And as you say you can't get uhm feminist theology  as he said 

Yes

This fellow Mortmann was was really was quite heavily influenced by twentieth century

It 's a shame they haven't got anything on Bonhoffer on the uhm

Yeah

Cos there was that book of uhm letters and papers from prison

Your essay list

Letters from Prison

Yes

Yes

But uh was it in that little book you had yesterday

The sermon he gave  when his daughter was married

Yeah

Yes

It was very good wasn't it

Yeah 

Yeah

That 's it

Yeah

That 's it

Yes

Bonhoffer was uhm a theologist during the last war in Germany and he died at one of the camps

He spoke out against uhm  against the Hitler regime

He died in one of the concentration camps

Yeah

And this book Letters from Prison is sort of what copies of letters from he wrote when he was in the camp

It 's amazing actually the number of German theologians that sided with Hitler  quite amazing and and changed their theology to suit 

Amazing yeah yeah yeah

Mm

Oh yeah

Yeah

Yeah

Yes

As they do in South Africa

It 's amazing

That 's right

Yes exactly

Theology is used as an excuse for anything any sort of 

It makes it sound as if it 's not your idea but sort of a high authority 's idea

That 's what it

Yeah

Mm

Mm mm

Yeah

That 's right

Yeah yeah yeah

He told me

Yes yes

Yeah 

It 's very easy to to do that really

They do it in South Africa don't they

Mm

Some of them

I think

The whites being the the master race

All this Noah and the ark thing and  one of his sons was

The The popular thing is that Noah had three sons and one was white one was black and the other was Asian

I mean this is as 

Everyone 's descended from these three sons

Mm

Oh

That 's right

Yeah

Mm

Was it Ham Jaseth and

And She Shem Ham and Japeth

Shem was the uhm was  semitic and Ham was supposed to be the descendant of Africans and Japeth 's the European

But uh Ham did something wrong and he was cursed by his father and told he would be the servant of his brother

This is the excuse that 's used in South Africa as sort of for white superiority

What was it

Shem Shem Shem yes

Mm mm mm

It was probably used in the Southern States as well

Yeah

Probably used in the Southern States as well

Yeah

Yeah

You can justify anything

I mean there 's a lot of uhm people justify anti-female behaviour through theology which you know if you actually read into it it 's a load of nonsense

Yeah

That 's right yeah

Uhm  but

It 's like

if you try hard enough you can justify anything can't you

You can justify anything through

Yes

Well yes

That 's right

Yes 

Which reminds me

apparently

well I say apparently theology is a Greek

well it 's a Greek deriv derivative

Apparently the theo is a male god

The study of of a male God

And the ology 

Apparently the literal translation is theo is of god  and logy is words of or is about

so words about God

but it it 's it 's a male God

Some of the feminist theologians male or female have been saying they 're not theologians at all

they 're thealogians 

Yes

Mhm

Yes yes

Thealogians

Yes

Thealogians

Yeah

Mm

Which doesn't occur in the Hebrew

Apparently the Hebrew word is  uhm a neutral word like like the English word God  is neutral

Yes

Yes

Yes 

The trouble is in English you can't say it without appearing offensive

You 've got to say he or she

That 's right

Yeah

That 's right

Which is a pity really because it would be better way t better way to talk about God  as being an it 

That 's not

Mhm Mhm

Apparently the uhm American theologians nowadays always use inclusive language

They don't talk about God as being he or she

And they quite often refer to God as the Divine  rather than use another word

Yeah

Mhm

And use their as the possessive 

That 's what We were doing that in linguistics actually

Bill was saying that uhm  to use the w meaning of the word their has changed

It now means his or her whereas before it didn't 

Somebody has left their coat  over there 

Somebody 's left his coat when it 's obviously a male or a female coat

Mm

Mm

Mm

That 's right

Yes

No

Mm

Yeah

Somebody 's left his coat

Yeah

Yeah

That 's funny cos I was reading somewhere that historically if you said someone has left his coat you could mean male or female

If you wanted to be If you wanted to be specifically female then you said someone has left her coat 

Yes when you say

Oh

It 's still a little bit like that in Welsh isn't it

Cos with Welsh they are a few numbers there used to be parallel sets of masculine and feminine numbers

but there 's just a rump now

There 's like two four  two three and four now have got masculine and feminine forms

Yes 

If you 're talking about  mixed sex yes If you 're talking about mixed sex you If you 're talking of male or mixed sex you use the male number 

if it 's female then you always use the female number

Yeah

There 's t two three and four

Have masculine and feminine forms

It 's very odd



 and 

Mhm

Yes but in French

I remember learning French

In the first year there was this big outcry about uhm  numbers

And they said you know

if it 's an all female set it 's the feminine

and if it 's all male it 's  male

and if it 's if it 's mixed yeah apparently if it 's mixed  then it 's the male

And they said what if there are room of a hundred women and one  one man

They said well it 's it 's it 's a masculine

All the girls went aargh it 's not fair Miss

Mm

Didn't realise it was the same in French

Ah

Yeah

Mm

One man

Yeah that 's

Yes

So it 's  and  is it

Yes

 and   or  uh  and 

 and 

Something like that

Yeah

That 's it 

Amazing 

I think one of the reasons my first three children are OK is because it 's not that I confide in them in the way that  you know when people say in a yuck way oh I 'm just like sisters with my daughter

we tell each other everything

I mean I don't do that but  I try and be kind of open with them so that they don't feel excluded

So for example I never made any secret of the fact  that although I liked Nick in many ways  we just were incompatible temp temperamentally  and Chris and I  suited each other 

And in a sense that was a very good thing to do because it was so obviously true to them  that  rationally they couldn't see any reason to 

It was a sort of openness and and like now I think one of the freson reasons our Fran who 's fourteen actually finds us so boring

She makes it perfec She 's not rebellious or difficult or anything but she obviously finds Chris and me terribly dull

It 's rather sort of lowering

And she has a slightly sort of cynical attitude as though she 's saying there there 

But one of the reasons is that she doesn't have anything to feel threatened about because we are completely open with her uhm

and therefore she feels like when she rings up from school in the evening she knows exactly what will be happening  apart from the fact Chris might be abroad or we might have people to supper or whatever

but basically we 're just sitting here having spaghetti and reading the Evening Standard

and it 's all the same

And so  uh or uh uh

I know you can't do it overnight 

but I think the way to win her back is by making her feel  that she 's not excluded from anything

and this is why sex is at the root of it  uhm because sex is the one thing you are excluded from

and you see in Franny 's case presumably presumably she thinks that we don't make love any more because of c course adolescents never think that grown-ups make love

so she doesn't even have to worry about that

that 's all over and in the past

But in Nell 's case  she knows that it 's not over and in the past

it 's happening 

I mean that 's a large part fifty per cent of why you 're together which is healthy

but she can't see it

and I don't know how you overcome that one

And then now even you went and saw a psychiatrist

I don't know what they 'd advise because I I I can see  and you can I can see things from her point 

And I think when she has a boyfriend of her own it will be much better 

 but that might not be for another two or three years

Uhm uhm uhm

uhm

uhm

Uhm uhm uhm

Uhm uhm yes yes

uhm uhm uhm uhm

uhm uhm

uhm  uhm

uhm uhm

uhm uhm  uhm

No

uhm uhm uhm

Well easily yes

or as my mother says you know I suppose this will probably turn her lesbian  

No I don't think it will necessarily

I don't see why it should because you don't flaunt your sexuality

I mean you 're not exactly wearing kind of leather skirts and high heels so why should it 



uhm

Uhm well that 's an interesting thought  yes

You mean because she doesn't like Gavin it might turn her against men

Yes I think that 's 

But she likes Bernard

Yes yes I think that 's probably the thinking

I think she likes men

anyhow I mean I I think she has a sort of school crush on  

And as she grows up she 'll see that her dislike of Gavin is irrational even if she can't admit it

uhm it will take a long time though I think and and probably doesn't want  thrusting in in

you know she she probably is pro

she 's probably better out of his company than  uhm  in it when she hates being in it and you know I 'm thinking

Well 

Yeah but as she grows up she 'll see  uhm  how selfish she was not to want you to be happy

but that won't be for a while

Not for a while no no

The other thing is I suppose uhm  uh that we this extraordinary notion  that adolescents  should have their family unit as their centre of their life which of course children who go to boarding school don't have

but of course  presumably if she is saying

no I don't want to go to boarding school

and yet you see she 'd have such a lot of fun there because she wouldn't have to think about you and Gavin and Bernard which is actually rather boring for her

She would have all her friends

Couldn't you send her uhm  to a mixed school at sixteen like King 's Canterbury where Fran 's going

or weekly

uhm uhm

Oh I see that yes uhm

uhm uhm uhm uhm

Weekly boarding at Westminster

No I don't think Westminster

Don't you

Well I 'm a bit anti it but there 's something well  only because it 's in Central London and I think that eith they are divided into two uh the the frumpy ones of which there are not very many girls who then get ignored and the pretty ones who I think they 're sleeping with their boyfriends straight away 

I think there 's a compromise

like Fran 's going to King 's Canterbury and I may be proved wrong where I think there are boys and they do all go out to supper in large groups on Saturday night that I think the atmosphere is much less sexual

Are you  why are you against it

Uhm uhm

Uhm

Uhm  is it uhm

Well I think so but I may be wrong 

And we have to make a decision in the next fortnight as to whether she 's going cos she 's just done the exam 

So uhm 

But anyway

King 's Canterbury is being spoken of very highly at the moment

It 's flavour of the month

there must be something wrong with it

It really is

isn't it

I wonder what it is

Yes

Well I think o

 was there

that 's the wonderful thing about it but it 's an awfully long time ago

I think ho

I think the reason is that it 's neither very alternative and free range like Bryanston  and nor is it too stiff like Rugby where uh if y

Rugby  the girls are just treated like a few honorary girls but they 're not integrated

At King 's Canterbury they are integrated but it isn't too free

it 's still quite academic

Also the other thing is  the school itself is so beautiful 

I mean it 's such a wonderful ambience to be in and so that 's quite nice uhm 

On the other hand for example somebody said to me  that the down side was that all the girls who go in at sixteen  really have gone there for a reason which is that they are unhappy at school  or dissatisfied with their present school 

They 're They 've all gone for a reason

Uhm

uhm uhm

uhm

uhm  uhm uhm

uhm

Yes uhm

Yes that 's a nasty thought isn't it because nobody is going to go there if they 're happy at their own school

It 's true

Not if they 're blissfully happy

Fran is very happy at Cheltenham

she is bored  so that 's not such a bad reason

she just wants a change

uhm

uhm uhm

uhm yes that that seems

But anyway they 've all 

There 's a reason and this makes for a slightly funny mix because you see I 'm used to that because of Trevor Roberts  where Franny went and everybody said you couldn't possibly send a normal well-adjusted girl to Trevor Roberts

you know they are all oddballs 

uhm uhm uhm

And that 's not the case is it 

Well they were all oddballs but what 's the the dividing line between an oddball and an eccentric and that 's what 's wonderful about Trevor Roberts

I mean he 's completely nuts  but in the best possible way

I mean he loves King 's Canterbury and so we 're rather hoping  that it will have some of that

Now you see if Nell went somewhere like that  which after all wouldn't be for a year and a half so you 're not forcing her off yet she wouldn't have to think all the time about you and Bernard and Gavin which is so unhealthy 

If you could get that across to her

but you wouldn't be sending her there

and she 'd probably get a scholarship too 

You wouldn't be sending her and then she 'd have such a wonderful time

because if they

I mean I know it sounds awful

but if they get a scholarship which I don't think Fran will have  though it 'd be nice if she did but she found the maths incredibly hard 

Uhm  they wear gowns

but I mean it is rather cute seeing these beautiful girls walking past the Cathedral which has been there for  hundreds of years in their gowns  i

it is rather

uhm uhm

uhm uhm

uhm

uhm

uhm uhm

Good point

uhm

uhm

uhm

uhm uhm

A gown must be a wonderful disguise for  uhm

Oh yes my sister-in-law was saying you know she 's all for uhm her teenage daughter dressing up and going to discos in whatever she likes as long as she wears a giant duffle coat over the lot when she 's waiting  outside the the school or whatever

I agree

Actually King 's Canterbury is a bit restrictive

and Franny doesn't like this thought

so I 'm

Their mufti I mean their weekend clothes  uh is a bit restrictive

They are not allowed to wear very short skirts and they 're not to wear allowed to wear loose shirts over jeans 

Fran was a bit depressed when she heard that I was too but

uhm

Loose shirts over jeans has got to be a sort of  temporary prejudice

hasn't it

The re The reason for it is I think that when they 're walking round the school so are thousands of tourists

and they are slightly on show

and I think they 're just saying

OK you 're not in uniform

but we 're not having people slopping around

and so therefore they 've drawn a few lines

but I think they 'll drop it anyway



Oh

Right  yes

Oh it 's silly

We 've got some friends coming to supper whose daughter 's there so I can question tomorrow so I can question her about it

But  I mean I th I mean obviously people other people have said this to you

that would be the solution for Nell wouldn't it to get away

uhm

Yes I think that 's probably right

It is a bit difficult the the fact of her  being

I mean she 's throwing herself into school at the moment and she had she 's got a little circle of friends that she absolutely clings to but I 'm not terribly sure that they 're the best thing for her

Uhm  I mean in in the oddest sorts of ways I mean they 're  really very proper and very sober and very conscientious hard-working little bunch

and they just leave Nell a little bit behind so that she 's always got something to aspire to uhm in terms of maturity

But she must be clever

uhm

uhm it 's just they 're more swotty

They 're no They 're slightly more mature 

they 're a bit more into boys

and Nell isn't quite sure what all that 's about yet

but I think she 's getting inklings

and they sort of zipped her up on her dress I mean really you know took her out of herself and her rather old-fashioned ideas

Uhm so that 's quite a good thing but I think she 's  much too scared to confide in them  you know 

So she 's playing a part

Yes she 's playing a part

Yes

And I don't think that 's healthy at all

Very tiring

could be tiring

Yes yes

Oh she is she is punishing herself

Yes

So I don't know

I 'm I 'm not quite sure

But you see I mean you mustn't flagellate yourself because her back thing  proved that she was never going to be the easy adolescent was she

and it might have been something else

so if this might have happened even if you and you know Bernard had stayed together

uhm

uhm uhm quite yes

uhm uhm 

uhm uhm oh yes 

Well aware of that but uhm  

It must be horrid for Gavin

Yes it is  absolutely horrid

Cor Helen that 's a healthy lunch

I know

She had a uh veggie burger

Yeah

How 's how 's your charming housemate

What 's it like

It 's nice

It 's a bit dry isn't it

What

Diane is still in Bradford but we had a letter from her 

It was mostly about the weather

It was really annoying

We wanted to find out all about her and Anthony and  how they 're getting on

And they seem to be getting on OK

but she sort of put one short sentence

and then it was all about how lovely the weather was and how nice everyone 's been to her

Mm yep

When was that

What do you think of the soup

Was it

Oh three-or-four-words

Mmm

Yes

Interesting diplomatic

Ah

Uhm 

Sarah 's fine 

Working very hard 

No the veggie burger was this sort of

I almost went for the pasta thing but

Yeah

And uhm

Well I had chips yesterday and they were delicious

Mm

They put them in the  container just as I got there

They were so hot I burnt my tongue

They were hot 

Really

I was telling Darryl I came down this morning to find they didn't have my printing margins 

The sitting room is white 

and I 'm sort of looking like snow

so good

Sarah had left the kitchen roll in the sitting room and Chicken had methodically shredded it 

Sarah says oh God bits of kitchen roll everywhere

It was really funny and he 's sort of sitting there going  looking really pleased with himself

Uh so

Ah

Ah bless him

Blessed 

How clever he is

Yeah 

I came to your flat at the weekend

I wonder if that 's because the cooks have changed or because uh

Mm

I really wanted to look in your room but I didn't

They 've lowered the budget or something

Mm

Oh you should have

it 's really cool

Mm

But that happened after the uhm the drop in standards

It happened this year in the well within the last six months and the standards dropped in the year before that

 

I 'm always like that about rooms

Mm 

I think if I 'd wanted a house I 'd be  

Surely they just  should just up the prices though 

Like if everyone paid an extra ten fifteen p or something 

It wouldn't take much

Yeah

I know

It 's very cheap after all

You were in London were you

Mm 

But the person in charge has an enormous effect on what is produced  because at  they changed the cook and then got to the point where they were virtually thinking of closing the restaurant and it changed hands

Did you have a good time

Yeah very nice

Yeah

Quite a quiet weekend actually  and lots of scoffing

Oh good

Chatting and not enough house

What did you scoff

Chocolate

No

I had a really nice Indian meal

Mmm 

Uhm

Prawn Korma

Oo lovely 

Did you make it

Uh no

We went to uhm a restaurant near Ben 

A  restaurant

The bloke in charge always he knows Ben quite well cos he eats there a lot 

he always comes up to you in the course of the meal towards the end  and says in this really sort of like dirty sounding voice  Amnam goori dresdin dasira ah dadala dada

What is is it what 's he saying

Go sinabak dree

Is it is it drugs

And all he 's saying is would you like a drink on the house

but he says it in this really furtive little voice

Doesn't want anyone else to hear

Yeah 

Ben 's face was just like alarmed when he first came out with this 

What 's he got himself into

Mm 

That 's very nice

Mm

You don't have to have one of those horrible lassi 

I love them

Do you

Oh I like the sweet ones 

What did you do

For the weekend

Mm

Uhm  I didn't do anything

I was supposed to be going away

and then  phoned up  say he was ill

so I stayed and I felt a bit panicky about sort of  being on my own all weekend

But in fact I had a really nice time

I went out shopping on Saturday and got a video and  suppose I have to cook something otherwise I just eat crisps all weekend

What did you do Saturday night 

Sorry

Saturday night

Watched a video

Solo 

Well with Chicken but he 's not much he 's not much good

Cos that 's  quite brave isn't it

I can't remember a Saturday night I 've spent on my own really  alone from other people

Well I 'm like that too

I wouldn't have minded if I 'd known it was going to happen for some weeks and I could have thought about it and I probably would have felt quite positive

But suddenly  finding out I sort of felt a bit oh my God 

And Sarah didn't come back until Monday either so

Mm

I bet you 're glad you 're not a vegetarian after 

Mm

I expect you 're glad you 're not a vegetarian

But I saw Darryl you know and that was the main thing

I normally like veggie veggie burgers

Yes 

And I had lunch with someone Monday so 

Sainsbury 's do a very nice 

Mm

Sort of deluxe burgers 

Spicy

What 's in them 

Chick peas and things

Yeah

But  maybe Helen can tell us

What 's in a veggie burger 

Vegetables 

It depends a lot on the actual veggie burger

Yes

Yeah

Some of them have  what is it textured vegetable protein in  and

they go like meat imitations

and then you get your vegetarian burgers that are much nicer

and they 're not anything like meat

and they 've sort of got rice and carrots and things in there

These are all right but they 're not very spicy though

Oh god

That sounds 

They 're horrible they 're

they 're revolting

Mm

Mm

Mm

Tasteless

Or kidney beans are a good base aren't they

Yeah

Aduki beans

They 're wonderful

Aduki beans are good with cumin and things like that 

Yeah 

A bit up-market 

Wendy were the best ones I ever had

Wendy Burgers

Oh yeah

Those were wonderful

What were they cashew nut and and uh parsnip

They 're really sweet

They weren't exactly I mean they were more what you might call vegetable burgers weren't they

They weren't what you a what you expect of a veggie burger

They were lovely

What do you mean

They weren't they were like they were fried things weren't they 

they were 

But normally with veggie burgers you did you did you grill them

Have you got veggie burger in your  dictionary

Mm

Yes

What 's the difference between veggie and vegetable burgers Darryl

Well what you generally refer to as a veggie burger is like  is when you have that much vegetables in it chick peas and potato and onions sort of what 's this sort of a this this meat substitute stuff whereas actually   is more like any any ingredient like uh cheese or  or vegetables or just put into a mould and fried 

More exotic

Mm

Darryl 's a  wee bit hazy on the difference there 

Yeah

They looked uhm they look like my grandmother 's  uhm  her fish  fish patties

Yeah

Home-made crispy patties

Mm 

They call basically they call anything a burger that you slap into a roll

Mm

Or a cutlet 

Mm

A cutlet

Oh God

I can't be indifferent about anything called a cutlet

We used to get them at school  for tea

And one day we had turkey cutlets

They brought it out

and the girl I was sitting next to

and they were like you know pre-pack frozen bread orange breadcrumbs

she cut into it pushed the bits apart and there 's this something stretched from one bit to another and it was I 'd swear to God it was chewing gum

It was chewing gum in this thing

And she took it out

and ever after that their name was turkey gutlets

and so really horrible

Oh dear 

Mm

And that was a good tea 

I had sardines once with a fly on it

I was just about to tuck into it and I noticed this great fly soaked in tomato sauce

so I took it back to the kitchen  and they they tried to convince me that this fish had swallowed the fly before it died

I said

but they live under the sea you know

you can't have flies under water

Ah it must have been swallowed by the uh sardine 

I couldn't believe it

Wouldn't give me another one

Oh God

 It isn't that funny

Oh yeah really

It 's all added protein

Yeah

Yeah

That 's exactly what they said when we found ants in the salt cellar

Oh my goodness 

Don't you think ants are a bit different to flies though

Where did you find ants in the salt cellar then

Sorry

Where were you finding the ants in the salt cellars

Stupid ants

Mm

Here

It was

No no not here

At school

Oh right 

I didn't know they 'd go for salt

Yeah

You find little little uhm you shake the salt cellar and there 're little sort of black blobs come out

and if you look carefully you see the legs start wandering about

but they 're dead definitely dead

He said oh no it 's the pepper

You 're lucky the salt was flowing in my opinion

Fancy complaining about ants being in it

Well maybe they put them in instead of  instead of rice 

Ants absorb the moisture you mean

Oh well 

What 's this book machine that Paul 's got

What is it 

Who 's

Gary was working on it

Is he

Book machine

It 's his great  brain child isn't it

Mm

Yeah

But what is it

It 's supposed to have a desk top publishing system on it

Oh but it 's not the first ever surely

Mm

Is that is that all

It was quite groundbreaking in its time

So it 's j just soft software is it

Mm

That 's a bit crummy

Mm

Book machine

Do you know 

Publishing software 

He got uhm  when he left publishing when he left Dixon 's he got some uhm guy to  write a program for him yeah and it was quite gr groundbreaking desk top publishing

It 's a sort of portable office

Write a program

I don't think it was necessarily the first

Oh no

Well I 'm sure

He 's now thinking about getting someone to update it 

And he 's very proud of it 

And then he has this  this  I think

and people  people who want to uhm  people who have copy and uhm for a magazine they 'd send the copy in

so they 'd make they typeset it on Book Machine

so it 's a way of dis it 's a wysiwyg text  and you can play around with it with margins and  headers and figures

That that that is an aspect of P C uhm which is interesting

But I what I am intrigued by obviously in terms of the language of of of of literature uh uh teaching is that in my current A level sort of lang and lit class uhm I 've got 

what have I got

I 've got north London blacks and north London whites south London blacks south London whites

and uhm in a class of sixteen they they they they

well they they they they mix in and out mix in enough

and they the the north London whites and south London whites talk very marginally differently

You have to listen but but but but it is there and

Really  yes

From the blacks

No no from each other uhm but but but

but most importantly when they when when when when they 're talking to themselves  to to to each other within the same community they they they talk one way

When they 're talking to other people within the class within the colour range they talk another way

When they 're talking across colour same type of  they talk another way

When they 're talking 

yeah yeah yeah yeah it is just different

When they 're talking to me  it 's different again  you know and and and

and whenever when any one of them is talking this is this is what really got me

and I thought this is uhm you know this this

this is how teaching really works that when one of them is talking across the class to another as it were via me as as imaginary chair they 're talking in a different way again

Oh Jesus it 's

But but nobody except for well apart from the fact that I 'm trying to ginger up understanding cos I said I think uhm

and I don't want to make them over self-conscious otherwise they 'll just shut up and say nothing but but

but when it starts off they you know you hear all this enormously complex stuff going on

and it 's not

No from each other OK

Really

Yes

Mmm

It strikes me  that you should use 

Yes I suppose so

Well well just just feed in some of your tapes and say look this is what you 've got to do

You 've got to analyse it like this

and please will you just point out any slight differences you note 

and you 'll get fewer  than you probably would

Well uh I I I I I I 'm not sure because actually I I 'm dealing with kind of individual bodies  and and and I hear them hear them being different



Yes rather

This is exactly what this research

Yeah i i i it is very odd this whole aspect of code switching

How would you convince one that he 's being different







Yes yes

Mmm

Mmm

Oh you said all of them yes mmm

Mmm

The sales is a bit weird

Yeah



Very odd indeed

London London uhm in in in the foreign service if you got sent to Guadalajara  it meant you weren't doing very well 

With with with with Dow Jones if you 're sent to London it 's roughly Guadalajara















Oh they they they they they 're east London wide boys

Yeah  right

It 's not their problem

I honestly don't think they 've got a problem

They they revel in it in fact

This is real total breakdown Lynn because

It looks like real total excess to me

Wha wha what what what 's going on here

Well

This is

I mean

It was going to be a sort of flan or something and and have wonderful  snowy lemons on the top

But it got as far as that which is sort of a kind of walnut cake 

And it may be nice without that top or maybe not

Don't knock it

It 's not funny

it 's absolutely delectable

It 's quite nice it 's quite nice on its own actually

Well anyway it might conceivably

But anyhow tha that 's

There 's a bloody orange  

So if you feel like uh uhm trying a bit of walnut pastry kind of cake and putting things on it judiciously

I mean let 's just 

Yes I feel like trying a bit of walnut

You haven't got any yet





Oh that yes

Don't do that

That 's right yes  oh dear

Mm

Thank you

 fancy might

you might like oranges in the  style

I don't know

I 'm not actually sure

It has to be tried though





It has to be tried 

Do they come from trees





They come from trees

Human beings can eat them





And it 's wonderful 

Just just before



Mm





Yes



Yes

Yes





There there there 's a sort of Community Centre tha that hovers uneasily in a disused church halfway between Hampstead and Highgate

Yes

A a and you can rent the tea bar for a nominal fee and that means you can rip off the public to a to a disastrous extent and make money for your choir and and and and and it works on the basis

Mm

Yes

Oh yes

You 're sure this isn't the  centre of Hampstead



No it 's not

Uhm if if if if you  up apple and walnut or bloody orange

Bloody orange or

Yeah

 orange

Yeah I saw

I shall have the dry first liquid second

I I I shall try that

Have a go at this  whi which has a kind of colour that I was born to appreciate

I mean I love it

They have everything

Well he was brought up on burnt toast

You should  in India



This this is the colour of Indian 

Ha half way between unirrigated  and and and and cow dung

and i i it 's a wonderful colour

 and cow dung 

Are you all done 

 i i it was an area of of of

it was in in

Wh

W what what what you do in in in high Victorian ti in empire times

Uhm you try to you build Hyde Park in Calcutta little realising you don't get quite as much sort of rain

Well you do

there 's a lot of rain in Calcutta but not at the same time as you do in Hyde Park

so for about all year round about ten months of the year uhm the the equivalent of Hyde Park the  in Calcutta looks exactly this colour  and very wonderful too

The other two months it looks not unlike Hyde Park   on a hill

Uh but but uh i it it it 's a very good colour  like nothing else is 

Thank you

Mm

Yeah

And the people still play cricket on it

Oh yes certainly

Well actually no

Mostly people live on it now 

Really

Mhm 

I suppose they live on it as well but they still play cricket on it

Oh

I am sure they do

Yeah

Yes

Mm 

But I 've seen a recentish picture

and uhm you know being a a flat space it 's got tents and well not tents but just garages I suppose

Yes

Yes





You didn't

I was thinking I should 've produced it

Would you like some





Oh there 'd certainly have been some sticky plates

I mean before we even installed Gavin 's decent cooker from  Dorking  there was the most amazing machine sitting there  which had all the

I mean it worked perfectly well

It 's just that all the indications of temperature had been rubbed off it completely

Mhm

Ah but it 'd been so well used  yes

About the only thing in the place of cleaning 

Or worn

Mm 

So we had some interesting bread

Sticky bread

Varying bread

Gauge the decision









Hm 



Mm



Oh actually I 've been thinking

 I was thinking



There hasn't been enough of it actually

I quite like that

My recipe said that the moules marini&egrave;res would be wonderful served with crusty French bread and I thought roll the crusty French bread 

Mm

Yes

Well what happened to it

Sorry

Uhm I see 

Uh 

Mm that 's a wonderful walnut cake





This is getting tender isn't it



Well no thirteen years ago

thirteen



Well Nell Nell is not as old as that yeah

Nell is fourteen





When did you get married



Nineteen seventy-seven so 

Mmm mmm

Fifteen

God that came out quick didn't it eh



Well  well we were home  uhm  for the three months between September and Christmas in seventy-seven





That that would probably be it yeah

With Nell



Yes in Prince 's Gate Mews when it was barely

I mean it certainly wasn't finished

No it it it was in the process of going through 



Yeah

Right well there was all that

Probably all that this year

And she 'd have been what one one and a  one and a bit

No no it wasn't actually  you see because  when she she was uhm

I mean she was

I might be wrong a bit



A month 

Seventy-seven

Very probably not

so it may have been before



I think you 're possibly right 

I mean that sounds like the 

Yeah yeah



Because I didn't actually go on breast-feeding Nell very long  on account of  this larking around in Prince 's Gate Mews 

I mean it wasn't just the business of maybe with one baby

Mmm



Yeah yeah so it had to be Nell

And Nell Nell 's breast-feeding only lasted for you know I mean three months drying up kind of thing 

and Dick was the next year

and I was in Brunei  all the way through Dick 's feeding which went on for about two months

And Nell was born in

Yeah

Yes you were in Brunei that year

I think that 's right



Oh yes

Uhm yes

Yeah



Oh yeah

That 's right yes

I I I I tried

She 's quite into carpentry

She does carpentry one-word-shouted

It was absolutely totally idiotic

We were trying to get this house ready to to let

Well Prince 's Gate  Prince 's Gate

Well  we were home on leave for three months which included Christmas with uh a small baby and when  and when we got to London  there wasn't a loo

A desperate state of affairs

And nothing had been done in the way that you  expected it to be done

Yeah

Nothing had been done

They 'd had three months in which to renovate it and they 'd started it in the last two months 

Well obviously they weren't finished

And we were supposed to be trying to get it ready to let  in that three months before Christmas  with a new baby  at Christmas which we weren't going to just take no notice of

Uhm oh it was ghastly

Didn't work

Absolutely

I think I remember the toilet didn't work

Mm

Mm

Yes oh yes Sue yes

My my sort of recollection

There there there was a fault by the time we got there

That that that was

The awful thing was that we just left it in the end to Gillian  Bernard 's sister and my Mum and they worked like blacks

They lived there and they worked  and kept at it solidly for two months so that we could we could let it uh to the nice black people 

It was absolutely horrible

Mm yes

And and got it into a a a state to to let to yeah

Yeah

Ah it 's not practical at all

Families

That 's quite different

Yes

We wondered whether you would like to have a go at your jigsaw puzzle

Oh yes

Because you had you didn't get a go with your jigsaw did you

No 

Cheers

Cheers

It 's a king

Cheers

But it also takes up far too much room  doing it here doesn't it

What 's that



The jigsaw

Thank you

What have you got

Sherry

Mm

Amontillado is it 

Yeah

Uhm it 's quite dry actually

It looks like Amontillado

Yes

Well what name

 I think

They brought me a bottle of Croft 's Original

Mm

Which is quite nice and sweet

Mm

Mhm 

They 're called Gasser the people next door are they

Must be a difficult name

Pardon

It must be a difficult name to live with

Gasser 

Well he is 

Well they both are come to that 

I suppose it is an unusual name isn't it



Well they 've just got lots of

Bits on

Mhm



Mm 

Cheers Gavin 

Cheers

Thank you very much for my nice present and the other ones that  aren't immediately visible

Happy birthday

You didn't read one of my messages 

It said

What

Yes I did

It said go and get some more roses 

No

Didn't I

Not on that one

A message

Well it wasn't a message

That was just so that

Ah  what did I say now 

What was it on

I think I said s something like

No

It doesn't matter

You don't need to bother

On the bowls 

Was it

I can't remember

It was on one of the little cards on one of the little parcels

I couldn't tell you which parcel it was on 

Sorry

It must have been 

Mm

Anyway it only said something to the effect 

Uh  here happy last birthday

and I put the last in inverted commas because it has a double a double meaning 

Charming  

This is it is it

Well I suppose if I lived each year as if it were my last I could enjoy myself couldn't I

Yeah 

Would you

I I I as you know quite unconsciously as I wrote it

When I 'd written it I thought good god what a thing to say to the poor chap  

It is actually how one should live I suppose 

Mm



I say look Sue 's made it pretty

 

Yes

I 'm making a 

Anyway



Have some nuts 

It 's so nice I don't want to destroy the pretty

Why don't you

Would you like a knife

Oh yes

Just a minute

Oh come on

Opened please  

Oh really

Don't stand in front of the 

They 're very good cheese straws Nigel

Are they

Excellent

Yes

Brilliant consistency and very nice 

I was just going to tell you that I have made a used a different rec slightly different recipe

Really

Mhm

Always a risky thing to do

In this case the risk paid off

Yeah

Well I 'd decided that  made so many sort of tiny minor changes to the original recipe which I 've sort of more or less forgotten 

it seemed to me that they weren't getting any better

And I thought well perhaps they 're getting worse

So I then found

well it was the book that had the pineapple pavlova and  the  

And there was a recipe there so I thought well I 'd try it out

And when I did I thought it was rather better

Can't remember what the difference was now though

Mm

Mhm

Mhm

Well this is very tasty

Mmm

It is a bit softer

Mm

Well I find

 it 's getting steadily harder your

Yeah

Well I 've been doing a lot of research into this and everybody that cooks I ask how they make pastry you see 

And they all say well it 's very difficult  

That 's about  the only information I 've ever got

Nobody can tell me how to make pastry like  used to make  and I I 'd never get it either

Nobody ever does make it like she used to make it

It was all beautiful you know

It was  the texture was slightly more friable than these 

But with a sort of lovely sort of shortbready kind of taste to it 

Now mine when I make pastry on a pie or anything  you know you can't cut it with a knife 

And if you do it flies to the other side of the room  

However  no one can tell me what to do about it 

They all tell me all the things that the books tell me

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mhm

Mm 

Mm 

Mm 

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm 

I think it 's just a very hit and miss affair 

Sometimes pastry turns out right as far as I 'm concerned and sometimes it turns out wrong

You ought to have seen our friend Michael  or whatever he calls himself 

He sits down you know with a can't go wrong 

Comes out beautiful

Much the best pastry we 've ever had 

Mm

Well I find it varies

Sometimes 

It 's very easy 

I mean it pro it produces a beautiful crumbly mix  obviously a very even mix 

The pastry isn't tough when it 's cooked 

I am coming to conclude that it must be because I get too much water in it or something

Mm

Yes

Mm

Mm

Mm

Yes

A lot a lot of water may

But you see if I don't get enough water in then the blasted stuff won't roll out

it cracks

Mhm

Mm 

Do you vary the amount of time 

D' you mix it after you put the water in 

Well with the Barry technique with the processor you process the dry things together and the butter  and then you put the water and the eggs in with a quick wizz at the end

Mm

Mm 

But  uhm one thing I found

and people have told me this which is that if you  put a very small amount of water in and if you then  wizz it for longer the same amount of water a small amount of water does the binding for you whereas if you only wizz it for a short time you know then it ends up looking crumbly and you think

ah more water

And and and you put more water in and then it can get hard and brittle

Well you see Barry has an endpoint which is very very critical 

He says you wizz it until it balls round the knife 

Well it does that very very suddenly 

And the last time well these cheese straws actually  I made it I put water in  half a tablespoonful at a time  

And between the last half tablespoonful and the one before it  you know it went from not looking as though it was balling at all to completely balling 

So it seems to exce exceedingly critical that endpoint

but if the correct endpoint is when it baw boils round  balls round the knife  then uh  it should come right every time

Ah

Yes

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mhm

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm 

Well that 's a way isn't it

I mean

But on the other hand I mean if you  if you put a half a tea a tablespoon of water in and it doesn't ball  what would happen if you then went on mixing for a bit  without putting another 

Mm

Well as far as I can make out it doesn't make any difference

It just stays as it was



Yeah

Of course you don't I mean th that 's the other thing with pastry is you don't want to mess it around too much do you 

But I I I don't 

No

Well I think that must be when you 're starting to 

Get the  fat into the flour



Yes

I agree

And I think  that uh it being messed around by the the food processor  very nearly said word processor is uhm very is is a lot less harmful you know  has a lot less of bad effects than if you 're working with your hands cos I mean it 's the knife is cool isn't it 

You don't have the the problem with it 

Mm

Maybe

Yes

Mm

There was another thing which made me think that hands can must come into it a lot because from some other recipe

I 've forgotten what it was but it was uh  well it was

oh no it wasn't

it wasn't pastry

it was almond paste 

and they said

don't work this too much with your hands because if you do the oil in your hands will 

or rather the other way round

the oil in the almonds

Mm

Yes

The heat in the hands brings out the oil in the paste

Will bring out the oil of the in the paste 

And uh you know uh uh it 's not a good thing

Yah

Mm

Mm

Mm

So it may be a similar sort of thing with your with your pastry

I don't know  that if you work it too much  it    put my hands in the pastry I think

And the other thing is one or two recipes have said categorically

you should never try to make pastry with soft butter or soft margarine 

You should always use it hard preferably straight out of the fridge or straight out of 

Well now most of them say half lard and half margarine or half lard and half butter 

But I have been using soft uh margarine sometimes 

Maybe I shouldn't do that

I don't know

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm

Yeah

Mm

I 'm sure that 's it

Mhm



Mhm

Mhm

I don't think so

I have had some very good results with soft margarine

Usually I find a proportion of lard helps 

Uhm 

Mm

 I think it obviously is something to do with water because the last time I made a pie pastry it was for a gooseberry pie  and I 'd oh I 'd I 'd just found that you could buy elderflower cordial

Mm

Oh yeah

Yeah

Now I was was introduced to elderflower cordial when I had my  when I was staying with Anne because she 'd made some

You see she 'd gone out looking for the elderflowers and made it 

it was delicious 

She used to put a little thermos flask by my bed every night filled with elderflower cordial

Mm

How lovely

Absolutely gorgeous isn't it



Oh yes 

 isn't it

Elderflower water at nighttime

Yes 

It was absolutely wonderful

Yes

Yeah

You know waking in the night with a  

Oh it was lovely



It was really good

Oh I lived like a lord 

yes yes

Yes yes

Anyway

When I went down the last time I went down to see Margaret and   they were having a  

Margaret wasn't  well hardly  and fill it up with water 

Well it was very good

It was not as good as Anne 's was but it tastes  very good

Then I was in Sainsbury 's and I thought I 'd have a look

Sure enough I found some uh elderflower flower cordial flower cordial

And I bought a bottle 

Anyway

Back to the gooseberries

I remember a long time ago Elsa had a a recipe that said 

could 've been apple pie or a gooseberry pie or something like that

you just put in a one head of elderflower  in the pie and with it when you cook it 

Mmm

So I thought well if I sprinkle a little bit of elderflower water into these these gooseberries  uh  that would be all right 

Anyway on this occasion the pastry I thought was going to be absolutely superb 

It rolled beautifully

It didn't crack

I got it to the right thickness

And I managed to get it on the pie

And it really looked a nice pie

And I cut some bits out and decorated it

When I 'd done it all I looked at it

and I thought

well that looks jolly good you see

I hope it tastes all right 

And I 'd forgotten to put the blasted elderflower cordial in 

Well this annoyed me a bit because I thought it was such a good idea to put some elderflower cordial in  

We 've got a little spray that we keep for spraying  ironing you see  with water

So I got this out cleaned it very thoroughly  mixed up the elderflower cordial  sprayed it over the top of the pastry  and that pastry came out just like a board

Yes

Mm

Mm

Yeah

Mm



Mm



Oh my God



She was uh

She 's not not the lady in the end 

She looks she looks

She looks like she 's 

I don't know where she 's from

She 's so young 

That was

She looks she looks Puerto Rican or something is it



Oh right she was wearing boots 

That 's not the guy you were talking to

That was someone else

No no no that was a groupie



You know the you know the uhm  the the little girl who had the striped T-shirt on and the long pony tail looked vaguely  Latin American 

She kept going up to a woman



Mmm

Yeah 

She was

That was her  daughter

To our right

Yeah

Yeah 

And she was playing on the stairs

She was she was just playing on the stairs quite a lot that little girl 

Well that it was her Mum

Sitting nearest to you eventually

Yeah 

Oh right 

I just wondered 

They weren't married though were they

Yeah

Were they married

Yes

Oh gosh 

Ten years  twelve years or something

They were actually married

Yeah 

He 's looking very s slim

Yeah he is

He used he used to be quite  portly you know

Well he 's he stopped drinking stopped smoking  cleaned himself up  

Doing really well

Mmm

Yeah 

Well that 's nice 

 

So yes descalers 

Hard to get a decent descaler these days

Yeah 

But there are

She can't say anything so she 's  buttoning her lip



Button your lip

If you get a descaler which really fizzes  like crazy when you put it in in the kettle that that stuff will clean it

Maybe it 's one of these

Sort of Alka Seltzer type thing

Yeah

Well it 's hydrochloric acid isn't it 

Caustic acid 

Bit of clostic acid

Bleach

No no that that 's sulphuric acid





We got one for our showerheads  which practically descaled the whole house

it was so powerful 

Really



But is it no

but is that sort of descaler  not poisonous

But they are all poisonous

Mmm



Mmm

Yeah

Uhm  any news on the  flat front

Oh the flat front

Oh yeah

Uhm no not really 

The mortgage broker says  no news is good news

Don't know but I 'll

but I 'll give him a ring  uhm 

He 's a bit impatient this man

He 's taking  a hell of a long time

Yeah that 's it 's about it 's about three weeks

And that 's just to OK a mortgage

Just to get just to get a go a mortgage off him



Well  I mean I think uh  if  I mean I think if there 'd been any problems they would they would have come up with that pretty quickly 

Uhm so I think I think that the fact that no news is good news is uh

Is good news





No his news is good news is good news





I don't  imagine it would



I think uh  that would probably 

Well

Well uh uh I don't think it would do any good 

His uh  his power in these matters is pretty limited 

Well I mean you just can't you just ring the the company direct 

Not direct 

I mean you usually can

Well it 's a bit difficult with these accountants

They 're running out of money

Well you see I don't want on the other hand you see I don't want to  push you know

 very simple

They don't run out 

If it 's a question of pushing them into a quick answer then  they 're more likely to say no just to get rid of me

I know

I know

 

Yeah but if there 's a quick answer there 's a quick answer isn't there 

How long has this been in 

Mmm

Well I mean if I don't if I don't hear anything by Monday or Tuesday I 'll I 'll try somewhere else  as a stopgap  as a as an alternative really

Mmm 

Well  so how did the gig sound

Did it sound all right

Yeah 



I was playing

I wasn't listening

I thought it was good 

Yeah ba base sounded good  

So what 's this thing you 're doing for John Harle is it

Harle

Harle

Who 's he

He 's uh  a classical saxophone player 

He 's a 

Have you seen the ad  for Nissan where they they 're chucking the car out the back of the plane 

They throw a car out of a plane and it falls through the air 

He 's just he 's just done the music for that

it 's 

He 's got about 

But he occupies a sort of uhm uhm Michael  type position in the scheme of things  at the classical end but also does  you know promotional things and uh

Uh

Right

Mmm

Yeah

Last time

Yeah 

Well that 's who I played with over Christmas  in the Maltings  in Aldeborough

Oh I went went there went there a couple of weeks ago  just just staying on a holiday

lovely Snape

Mmm

Mmm



It 's the most gorgeous place



Yeah it was good

It was a nice concert 

You know he 's  you know it 's weird

It 's hard to describe the the music really because uh you know you play some kind of  tunes you play some  jazz stuff you play some song poems the kind of systems type things 

There 's there 's quite a lot of jazzy stuff although he and all the solos are wr kind of his solos are written out cos he 's got to do them on his own

Cos it 's got to be very uh uhm  controlled sort of the tone on the sax you know get very high notes and very softly

and  he 's very good

Yeah

Yeah

So is he quite well known then

Well he he 's

I hadn't heard of him when I first sort of bumped into him uhm

B B C

It it was through the B B C wasn't it

No it was through Lubbock

I thought it was through the B B C that you did that uhm music for the B B C 

Yes but not through the B B C though

Because Lubbock couldn't do it so they passed it on to me

Yeah so you 're both doing this one

Oh we 're both doing this tour yeah

Where

All over the country

Pretty much again Edinburgh Manchester Belfast Cardiff

Things like that

Did that come up 

Bloomsbury Theatre

Did that come up before Sarah Jane

Yeah

Have you  uhm  had plays which have been taken on by the B B C or

Uh I wrote a screen play for the B B C just lately but uhm they they didn't they haven't done it

They were going to do it but they do that they do that quite a lot

Hard to finish anything because they 've got to sort of keep their keep their  slots covered

I started

The television writing that I 've done has been uhm  has been probably the the most frustrating that I 've done because I was also commissioned by  Channel Four uhm to write

I don't know if you remember the She-play series

There was a sort of 

And they did a series of plays by women which I was commissioned and uhm and which they fully bought from me and and again didn't screen 

So if I had

But  they paid but at least they paid for it

They did they did

they paid for it but but I think in a way that 's not the point uhm

Yeah  no you don't want the money

you want to see it

Yeah well yes

I mean I think I think the most frustrating thing about television is uhm the amount of people that that uhm want to be involved

uhm  and uhm  and I think you find that uhm  there 's a lot of uhm script r script editors and producers who are frustrated creatively themselves

and uhm

Oh sure

And they want to screw up what  what you 've done

We well not not that they want to screw up they want

they want to contribute

and so you 're you 're pulled in several different directions and and

and inevitably you will compromise yourself  and that cos all those strings are are sort of being held by someone else 

And again what happens then is that you sort of lose the skill you lose

you forget the reason that you wanted to write whatever you were writing to begin with

and you kind of lose steam on it and uhm 

the screenplay that I was writing I was actually co-writing with another woman uhm and it completely destroyed her 

They the sort of relationship that we had both as friends and as writers because it 's just such a

The B B C were like this third party that kind of came in

and there were all sorts of dictates from above what they needed that year and uhm and what and what  the viewers wanted to see and uhm

and so what whatever kind of things have been important to your to your script were were trivialised really in in order for them to get what they wanted to get

But uhm I mean you know there might be an element of sour grapes in in what I 'm saying you know but I think uh I think that a lot of writers  have had that that experience with television

You end up by feeling quite compromised 

Certainly with the the theatre that I 've written that 's been far more rewarding

Yes yes

Mmm

Yes and you had some of those performances since

or you 've had some of those plays performed 

and they worked out  well 

What sort of plays do you write

Mmm mmm

Mmm mmm

Uhm well I write uhm

At the moment I 've got two commissions one which is this uh a commission to write a what will be I suppose a family show

and it 's for five to ninety year olds and it 's uhm  and

and it 'll be it 'll be uh produced over  autumn and Christmas period in ninety-two this next this year  and uhm

and the other one is is an is an adult uh full length  sort of play that will be toured by a company called Monstrous Regiment

Mmm

Uhm so 

What what area of entertainment are you in then

I 'm I 'm in the re record business  music business

uhm I do

Oh right my husband 's in the music business

So I understand

What 's he do

Well he 's a  he 's a keyboard player and produces a bit on his own

He 's he 's got a  publishing deal with with uhm what 's his name W E A

W E A  Warner Brothers

Mmm

Great

Is he does he have a successful career

Well he 's done all right uhm 

I mean it 's

you know it 's always difficult

but uhm he 's 

Is he exclusively W E A

or can he work 

Well uh as a e e in the songwriting yes

but he uhm he uhm

Now he 's working with Virgin at the moment because he 's working on Sarah Jane Morris 's album

but uhm

And uh I mean you know he 's 

He he works with with va various different record companies you know in production and session playing as a as a in in in in live gigs

he tends to sort of do these jazz jazz gigs these days  

and he 's he was with with Working Week too  for a long time

Who

Sorry sorry I

He was with Working Week for for quite a long time and and he doesn't he doesn't do a lot of live playing any more

He tends to tends to work with

Harry Beckett he plays with quite a lot

and Coup D'Etat

I don't know if you know the the jazz jazz scene much at all

Right

I 've heard of him I I I

I have

I 've heard of him

I certainly have 

Yeah  uhm but uhm 

Yes I mean he he 's done all right

He uhm 

He 's arrived

What what did you actually set out to achieve in in the first day 

Can you remember 

I can't remember exactly because  I didn't start producing plans until Thursday

Last Thursday

Yeah 

But you say you began to feel better before you produced a plan 

Uhm to a certain extent yes

OK

So you 're saying the plan was irrelevant 

Well it helps to get some things down I find 

Some things I can remember without writing it down but  I 've been that  the best way to remember things is to write it down

It 's  if you have revision it 's  if you 've a lot of  important things  and keeping appointments uh  etc

Mhm

Mhm 

Who told you that

My personal tutor last term 

Is that because you were having difficulty remembering things 

Uhm I thought I was at that time 

I wish I could feel relaxed about uhm  certain aspects of my life  such as work and exams 

Mhm

The impression I got was that your your memory was pretty good basically  and this wasn't a problem

Maybe

Yeah but I would like to improve it 

It  can still be improved even if it is fairly good

Mhm

Mhm 

I feel I 've got to grips with my subject better uhm  than I have in  in previous weeks

Certainly  certainly true of this term in  certain bits 

Very definitely true of last term 

I have been able to you know  use the resources available to me more effectively

What what sorts of resources 

Such as my textbooks from the library  etc 

Mhm yeah

So you now feel that you 're getting on top of the work

Yes

Uhm  and uh you understand what 's going on

Yes 

And that 's in seminars and lectures

We don't uh have seminars as such

We have tutorials lectures and practicals

Mhm

Right 

That 's that 's a big step forward isn't it 

Yes 

That 's very good 

But having said that uh  I still find that uh  when I eat I haven't  I haven't been ab able

I don't 

I know that I  probably I know that I should  eat but  when and I cook  uh considerable  quite a large quantity of food  and then find that I  I don't feel all that hungry  even though mostly  uhm I usually skip breakfast and  uhm travel on cups of coffee  or tea 

Mhm 

I realise it would be be better for me to cut down my caffeine intake  and decide and try to space my tea drinking  throughout the day

Dr Heath uhm advised me to  probably take some exercise

so I have been going  uh a couple at a few long walks in Regents Park  brisk walks 

Uhm so that I missed my walk uh  last weekend 

I 'll try and fit it into  some time during the week because it closes at dusk so 

I would like to get about two hours ' walking done 

And so uhm perhaps tomorrow

Mmm

Mm 

It sounds that you 're wanting to take care of yourself physically as well

Yes 

But you worry about eating

Is that is that something new 

You didn't mention that  when we last met 

Is it

I did mention that uh  I was finding it difficult to   when I was having uh I was having  some sort of dull a dull headache 

Mhm 

Uhm I 'm not quite sure what you 're saying

Are you are you saying that you get hungry  and you never feel as if you satisfy that 

Or are you saying that you uhm lose your hunger as soon as you 've got food there and

Right 

I take it you know what the what 's causing that

Yes



Mmm 

Is that a new experience for you

Fairly new

Yes 

I see

And you do your own cooking

Yes

Are you a good cook 

Fairly

I mean  are you the sort of cook who  forward to eating his own food



I don't uhm

Not fairly elaborate or anything

Usually cook out of tins and jars  and packets 

Right

And do you normally like that sort of food 

It saves time

Mhm

It 's certainly convenient for cooking

But uh if you had the choice would you prefer to have a meal which has been freshly prepared with uh fresh ingredients and so on

It would be more expensive

Yes

I would consider trying that

I understand that if you had the choice

Yes

I would

And if you had a meal like that offered to you do you think you 'd uh  you 'd find that more appetizing

Yes 

Right

Uh I mean I just wanted to understand that

D' you think that 's part of it

Is it just that the food is becoming boring 

or is there something more to it than that

Yes

I wouldn't say food was becoming boring

Mhm

I wouldn't say there was too much variety

But  I think it 's an improvement from the past

Mhm 

So d' you uh it sounds as if you feel there 's something more to it than just the quality of the food

Mm 

Have you any idea what that might be 

Yes

The taste and nutritive value

Fine

Mhm 

I eat a  very balanced diet

I know there are certainly no deficiencies in it 

But I think it could be more varied

Yes 

The trouble is uhm  there have been a number of thefts of food from our communal refrigerators

And of course nobody will own up 

Yes

Mhm

We were we were warned about that uhm when we first came to Pranhard 

Do you think it 's one of the other students

I do 

And what do the other students think 

Well they obviously don't approve of it and they 're all  in the same boat really

Well when you 're saying thefts is it large quantities or just the occasional

It 's just the occasional

Tin or bottle of milk or something

Yes 

Particularly milk 

That 's why I didn't buy any milk this week 

Mm

D' you eat on your own

Yes 

Do you enjoy eating on your own 

Uhm more or less or less

Or would you prefer to eat with other people 

I do occasionally eat with other people

Yes

Well uh just to give me a picture of it I mean

Do you uh  do you cook your meal

and the other person cooks theirs

and then you sort of bring it out to table and chat

or do you ever share cooking

No I don't ever share cooking no

Do other people 

Yes

They do

Mm 

Is that something that that bothers you at all 

Uhm  not to a great extent

I haven't given it much thought

Mhm 

I just wonder whether mealtimes is pretty miserable you see 

They are at the moment

Yes

Mm

Or whether it may be little to do with the food

It may  be because they 're just miserable times for you 

I don't know I guess 

Mm 

When I was at home  more often than not it was my mother that cooked or sometimes my father

Mhm 

I did cook occasionally  when they were out 

And so a few cu a few lunches  I cooked for myself

That usually happens in our family 

Up here it 's time thing

What

 to try and  set as usually set aside for meals 

Would mealtimes at home be  congenial

More more than at Prankard Hall

Mm

Do you tend to chat and gossip  over meals 

To some extent

Yes 

Are your parents talkative

They are

Yes

But you 're not 

Or are you

I can be when I 'm at home

Yes

Right 

When I 'm talking to them but not during usually during mealtimes

Right

Usually  in fact particularly in the evenings sort of 

There isn't very much else to do  and they are much less busy than during the day

Mhm 

Is the mealtime the worst time of the day for you

No

When 's the worst time 

I don't think there is a wo best or worst time

Mhm 

They can vary

Yes 

They just vary day to day time to time  during the day

Have you made any further  friendships since we last met 

No

Uh not yet 

I have one or two more

Mhm

I mean I I I don't mean anything necessarily profound uh

but are there have you got to know more people

and have you do you find it easier just to chat to people

Yes

Yes

You do 

Definitely

Are you feeling more  positive and optimistic about  college

Yes

Yes 

Right 

So what we 're focusing on is the thing that 's still a problem although other things are getting better 

Yes

Right

Just to  confirm that 

You say that the uhm the timetabling

It it it sounds to me as if you 're you 've taken some sort of control over that and that you you tried out timetable and you found it wasn't actually

Well I have an academic timetable

Yes

Right

Yeah

But creating your own is a help

Yes 

Have you modified it now in the light of your experience 

I will modify it

Yes

Uhm

And you feel quite confident about  producing an effective timetable

Yes

Good 

And I 've made steps to improve my writing  such as it is

What

Have you got an example of it that I can see

An example yes 

Before our art guy improved it

Well that would be useful actually  

Uh yeah

Because you are talking to somebody whose writing is renowned for its illegibility 

That 's me 

You see I 've got very bad writing 

A number of members of staff have the same problem

This is  the improved version 

And this is  the illegible 

Yes

It 's much more legible

That 's actually all all it needs to be isn't it

D' you 

I mean the letter 's more distinct

Yes

I can I can I can read the older version  but uhm I have to ha work at it

Yes

Is that written quickly

It is fairly quickly

Are you a are you generally a quick writer

Yes

When I 'm taking notes I have to be fairly quick

Mhm

And d' you use a biro

Yes

D' you find that easier

Yes

I think it is an option now

Because one way of improving writing is to use a  a fountain pen 

How did you get to set about uh improving your writing

Well I was told to 

There was uh some comments made on one of these practicals write-ups  which I thought were actually a bit rude

Right

What what did they say

He actually wrote failed

This is  biology

You should have been a medic

you have the handwriting

Right

That is an insult isn't it

A bit

Yes 

Right 

There 's no point in uhm  I suppose undertaking experiments if people can't read them  

Yes

That 's what he said

Well I mean that 's what he 'd say 

Can you read your writing

Yes

Right

Well then you can't be a medic 

Well occasionally I can't read the odd word

Right 

Yes

Sometimes I find it difficult to read my own writing  but uhm

Well that 's that 's good what you 've done there 

And ha has it been noted

Well it hasn't been yet rejected  you know 

But the man who conducts the practicals

Will it matter to you if he knows this is it

It will

I mean if if he said my writing was beastly 

So if he doesn't say anything about it now will you take that as being  a compliment 

Uhm  I will ask him if he notices it if he doesn't mention it

When you talk about sitting in on a course you 're actually not there as a participant

I am there as a participant

I was there in fact

I went through it

Their their first sort of phase is to get you to go through it as a delegate to experience  as a delegate

So I was delegate

Right

So how come you 've been treated differently

Well I wasn't 

We 're now talking about not doing not doing the complete  part of the course I suppose

Well they he he is showing me that course to to one to get to know me a bit better because it 's residential so you 've got time you know more time with people uhm and two to let me see the material 

The idea was for me to see the material and say well yes

I can do it

or no I can't do it 

or yes I like it

or no I don't like it 

whatever

So that was  so the the original situation was I mean I  at the minimum I get a a three three and a half days of of of a  of a of a very well put together course  that

that I now know 

Although I don't know the  the uhm well I know the content of the one day module  uhm and that 's up to the individual how they use that

They have options as to what they want to do with that day 

Uhm they you know some of them bring bring a client in from the workplace and then have the counsellor sit in and coach them

Some of them have some questionnaires

They might do it you know however they 're going to use it

So that I wouldn't need to see  uhm

Mhm

Mmm

That 's right

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm

Because if he did it with you you 'd be the only person there so that you wouldn't see a variety  

Yeah

That 's right so

Yeah 

So it 's

yeah as I say there I think there are about twelve options that they had to do with this particular day

It 's their day to use as they feel important for them

Yeah

Yes

Yes

So you 're still taking the the attitude which is  you are sitting in on this course

You don't actually see it as something for you 

How sorry how do you mean

Well you say you sit in as a delegate 

But you 're not actually using the course as a delegate

You tell me you 're not an experienced counsellor not to teach counselling

You you do the course as an opportunity to see how the material is organised to see whether you can teach it 

But presumably you also do the course in order to acquire some counselling skills for practice

Yes

Yes

Yes

As a normal delegate you would 

I  was not looking at and and I got some practice  uhm and learnt  a couple of bits but but mm I mean I knew most of  the material  there

Mm



Theoretically yes

But you said you 're not familiar with it in practice  because you 're not working as a counsellor 

Uhm

Oh well we didn't have enough practice I don't think on our course 

Uhm  but the reality of it was I could do I mean you know I I c uh  I think I  I could do the counselling that I had to do there 

Probably

I mean I was I was pretty much advanced on the delegates

Right

Mm

Right

I mean one of the one of the the the girls actually said

well she 's experienced and then she sort of said

very experienced

I mean I 'm not very experienced but she 's you know the one of the trainees  said said that 

So I think it sort of came across

I I felt  yes I could have done it a lot better but but I certainly could do what they were doing

I mean I was sort of going further than the stuff that they were they were doing

So that was  I wasn't I mean you always learn don't you every time you see something but I but  uhm and I did did learn some oh bits on language

There were some bits in their uhm  uh a little bit on the on N L P

uhm but I 'd read that and he didn't really use that

So I knew the  the the content of what he did but it wasn't actually used on the course

Nobody really did anything very much with that 

But uhm th you know a few

But I I wouldn't have said that there was very much new 

Uh uh ninety-eight per cent of material  that was covered I knew  and  had  used  and could use 

Uhm but I would  uh I I 'm not an experienced counsellor that I could sit there and just counsel anybody through anything and so on

So if you had a demonstration if something came up you know there 'd be things that I 'd sort of go 

I don't know what to do here

You know so that 's what I 'm saying that I feel that I would need much more experience to be able to deliver the course and feel confident that I could demonstrate it or handle anything that came up anywhere

And I 'd I 'd feel you I I 'd I need more  you know to be able to do that

But as I say I was further there than I

I would have thought that I was maybe fifty sixty per cent the way there  to where they are  OK uhm or where they 're going to be

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm

Yeah

Mm

Mm

Are they the trainers

No

To where no not the trainers

The trainers are much more experienced

No

The where the course is taking the people

OK 

No

I mean there 's the the uhm  the guy the the the lead guy there 's a clinical psychologist

And he 's uhm uh with the and he was a clinical psychologist with the police force for twelve years and he 's pretty  pretty sort of skilled and has been doing this course there for three years 

Quite quite experienced  counsellor

I don't know the background for a  couple of the others

but one of the other ones was this guy Charles Edward Clarke or whatever his name is

The the guy that 's just edited Handbook of Counselling with Windy 

And he was the head of B A C

Yeah

And and so I mean you know he 's quite he 's  well you know they 're you know  pretty experienced counsellors

So  yes

Mm

Mm

Mm

Oh 

Mm

Yes

Mm

Mm

Oh true true

My question was about your interview because you talked about a very interesting group dynamic where  you were both a group member and  also an observer  an observer and a participant 

Now I 'm wondering

first of all did the other group members know  that you were  with two roles 

Yeah

It wasn't uh formally  said

No

I mean the introductions were left in a very vague way anyway  so you didn't

Yeah yeah

The formats for the introductions were were very loose 

You had to say one thing about  your job and he mimicked that he he he did uhm eh demonstrate the mimic he demonstrated that in you know  gave an indication of what that should sound like

Like you know I 'm currently Personnel Manager for I C I 

And that was it

Uhm and my feelings about that are

So each there were three areas  uhm and the third one was anything else and one was about you  personally 

So I mean it was a very brief intro that was left deliberately very loose so there was no sort of but

but I mean people were aware of that because then you know me sort of telling people or you know it coming out in a conversation in other ways you know over over time 

Mm

What by everybody  or

Mhm

Mhm

Mm

Mhm

Mm

Mhm

Mm

Right

So you actually wanted people to know that you weren't just there as a delegate

You wanted them to recognise your experience  and that your role was different to theirs

Yes 

Yes

Mm

Could you take a moment to reflect on that internally 

Mm

What the need was to separate yourself from the group

and is it significant in relation to what then happened 

Mm 

I 'm not quite sure  what my need was 

But certainly I I can remember in in the first sort of brainstorm thing we did which was fears and hopes  uhm which is where that sort of first came out uhm  was a need to express a fear  that  I would be expected to be  uhm  to have a certain sort of level of skill and whether I 'd have those skills 

That was my first

I think that I mean I can remember the  exercise

and that was the first 

I felt the need to to express that  that I was concerned whether I 'd  that

that was what I went with 

and I wanted to

Mhm

Mm

So you said it out loud

Yeah 

So but that was in a smaller sort of  group cos we were doing it sort of like a a sort of  

Uhm so I felt that was  that was where that was coming from at that point 

Whether there was this sort of need to separate myself anyway uh uh in any in any that was the initial  thing that was happening

Uhm 

No but I don't think it was from a need to say oh I know  more  than other people do 

Uhm  but I did need to have uhm  I did have a need to say  that I was doing something because uhm  otherwise I wouldn't be anybody if you see what I mean

Because I didn't have a job

I couldn't say well

I 'm personnel manager here

or I 'm this or that or whatever 

So that is the one stable sort of steady thing that 's in my life 

so I needed  to to say that

Mhm

Mhm

Mm

Mm

Which is what in fact

The course

OK

That I 'm on the course

So that I 'm studying

Mm

Ah so you 're talking now about 

It didn't matter what it was

Yeah

It wouldn't have mattered if I was sort of studying I I don't know mathematics 

I needed to have  to be able to say  I 'm doing something

I don't  uhm I didn't come in uhm  from an angle of needing to  know more on that subject than other people

I don't think that that was a an issue in there 

Uh uhm b but I did need to  justify my existence in terms of

you know well I 'm not just sort of lounging around at home all day not knowing where I 'm going 

So I needed to put a tag on me

Mm

Mm

Yes

Mm

Who are you justifying yourself to in your head  with all these people around you strangers 

You talked about authority figures and you how you 'd connected the group leader with the 

Mmm 

Who do you think this is really for 

Well me

Mhm

Mm 

Who is it in your head who said to you  you must be doing something  to justify your existence

It 's not OK just being who you are 

I 'm not sure if if it 's uhm I don't know if that 's my Mum or my Dad  cos it it cert I don't think it 's really coming from them

It may be that I think that it 's them but it 's not 

Uhm cos I think the problem with Dad his his attitude is oh why don't you  you know just go and get a part-time job  down the road you know  sort of thing

So I don't think I need to have any  well yeah I guess I need to have any 

well yeah I guess I need to be doing something to please him

I mean yeah it wouldn't be OK for me to just do 

But I don't know if that 's  if that 's more a case of him sort of knowing that it 's no good for me to be sat around at home 

So you know just uhm that it would be healthier for me to be doing something

Uhm 

Do you do you think it 's them

Mm

Mm

Mm

Healthier 

Yeah

Rather than sat around not doing anything

Yeah

May be that

I do I don't know

I don't I don't really know

Uhm  uh

I 'm going to try and have Wednesday off

Yeah 

This week

uhm

Yes 

Uhm

You 're back this week aren't you

Yes but I 'm off Thursday and Friday

Oh right

I 'm probably off Friday again

study leave 

But uh Thursday 's oh sorry Wednesday uh  I 'm meeting up with a friend

Mhm

Mhm 

I understand 

I 've been let down once before but there you go

uhm

Anybody I know 

Oh let 's see uhm 

Yes you know her

The one that phoned up yesterday

Do I

Oh her

Her

Yes

Well  that should be eventful

Yes

Make sure you 've got your flak jacket with you

They don't seem to materialise though do they

So we shall see

Uh now  I 've got to work this out

Try not to oh I know what I haven't done

I haven't uh plugged that in

Yeah

Well I 'll plug it but I need a gadget to go in you need a phone to go into it 

OK 

Uhm

Need some bread 

Nice bread

I like it

Yeah I know

It 's I think that 's the best

Raymond Blanc 's got actual French ovens hasn't he 

I mean

He has French French everything almost

French everything

Oh

We shall see 

So he had a stroke

Yes

Quite a severe one  apparently

He 's not very old is he 

He 's forty odd I would have thought

Uhm not from not from not from where I stand but uhm 

OK

So you 're an old man

I think we all know that

Thank you

Uhm no he 's uhm but you see people have strokes not necessarily when they 're old

Strokes are quite often uhm the fate of k youngish people uhm

Particularly fairly intense and uh highly strung people appear to be 

Uhm my father had a stroke

He had a stroke when he was thirty-three

Blanc I think is about forty  oh well forty something anyway

Mhm

Uhm

uhm

Your father 's stroke 's very uh delibitat  delibitating

Uhm I I 'd spell it a different way if I were you

But I know exactly what you mean

Yeah

It was

Delibitating

Whoops

Debilitating

Try that one

It did a lot of damage certainly

Yeah uhm

Left him in a bit of a state

Debilitating right

Yes

uhm

Uhm

Raymond  still seems to be able to uh work the ovens anyway

Well the the the reason I think is that uhm modern medicine  now enables people to cope

Yes

You 're getting cheese on your  jumper

It 'll improve the flavour

It 'll improve the flavour 

Uhm it enables people to come through

Uhm

Yah

Mhm

Improve  appearance more

Uhm

Now then

Uhm

By the way Liz is OK for going to the uhm  Verdi in Oxford  and dropping into Le Manoir 

That 's why because the base which is basically a prerequisite of going to uh  to do that as she hadn't been there for a while yeah

Oh good

Uhm

Oh good good

Best start s best start saving

Yes

Did she look at the other operas

and uh sort of uh say that she 'd

uh no

I 'll tell you now

No

She didn't

I mean was she not  was she not allowed to or

She didn't

No no

Cos you only asked me to look at that specific one

so I did

Well I did but perhaps she might  if she wanted to

No

No

Sh sh she well not Well

no no she isn't into a lot of opera

and if you start giving her a series of events to go to it 'll make her shy away

I see

She hadn't She hadn't been  on the uh the restaurant run for a while and uh  she hasn't been to  Great Milton 

So for some time  she 'd quite like to go because she hasn't seen it his his new conservatory has she

No

Don't know

I mean it do doesn't have to be uhm Le Manoir

We could always go to Shinfield and see uhm 

I don't think so

Burton-Race

Well if he 's handy and his delightful wife

Yes

uh which is on on the way almost

But I mean I d do so enjoy  the atmosphere at Le Manoir

Christine

uhm

Well 

Liz is quite keen to go there 

so why not do it

Now she doesn't want  to do this sort of thing a lot if you see what I mean  and uh  she does like well I think she actually likes it but  has a sense of proportion

Hold on

Here 's a napkin

Oops 

By the way did I mention my dustbin 's been blown over in my back garden again

I 've given up now

uhm

All right

uhm

Yes you did

You did yes

I 've put newspapers in and I don't know

Uhm

Well mine 's been prised open by that large ginger cat

Can't get mine off

You see al  although although your one is heavier than mine mine is light  vacuum-formed plastic

uh it  it it actually sort of

more or less uhm where yours just drops on it you have to push it on

Well mine 's got quite a large  lip and in fact it 's not easy to get it off

It must be a highly ingenious cat uhm

It 's probably that the pussycat who 's who 's making the mess down by my uhm  shed

Yes

It It eats the contents of my dustbin and then deposited it in your garden

Oh yeah

Very funny

uhm

Hah

So when was the sell-by date of this soup

I wouldn't dare look

I mean some time last year wasn't it

Some time last year

uhm

Fish soup

Some time last year

My God

My mother would be horrified if she knew this

Cor

It tastes good

So 's this

Uhm

Smells OK 

uhm

Have to rely upon you for that because the cold effect is still annoying my taste

Uhm 

Uhm

He 's a funny chap that uh solicitor 

Oh I know

Oh yes

Oh God yeah

Surprised he 's a solicitor

He uh  he 's a diffident fellow  uh

Why do you say that

He does appear to be uhm

Well I don't know about diffident

I think servile would be a desc m more accurate description

Servile and and and spotty with it

What type of practice does he work at

He 's very ha Well he 's got skin problems

Yeah

But he can't help that

uhm

No

But it goes with the general presentation

Does it

Well I think so

Yes

His servility and the s spots go well together

Uhm God

You 're a hard person

Yeah

Well what I 've I I find uh irritating about him is that it 's virtually impossible to get rid of him without telling him to go as you as as you probably noticed

As I no noticed

Yeah

I was wondering when you were going to do that

I could see you were wondering when I was going to do it

but I just just waited for a suitable uhm  long long breath on his part because he he has the technique of uhm punctuating quite rapid conversation with very staccato breathing thereby not leaving a sufficient gap to get in without actually overriding what he 's saying 

Moment

 Is he uh Is he single

I don't know

Uhm  he had a girlfriend staying

well I think it was a girlfriend staying at his place 

Uhm but the the lodger last time I visited was uh of a different kind and

Mhm

Oh I see

So I don't know what he 's up to

Uhm

What do you mean of a different kind 

No longer female

Oh dear

Yes well that conjures 

it wasn't what I was thinking

But uhm I I don't think that I don't think it was that kind of a relationship 

He he d he

Oh but what type of property has he got

It 's a flat isn't it

No

It 's a three bedroomed  house with a  with an integral conservatory 

Three bedroomed house

Oh

Like yours 

Here

Uhm well not exactly no

His his his his His is a modern  uh development where the conservatory 's been built  as part of the house

It 's part of the back wall

What do you mean by three bedroomed

Oh you 're right

In other words it 's a bit like the back back wall 's been taken away

Where you normally have a back wall you 've got the conservatory downstairs and it 's all glass doors

Yes uhm

Yes

It 's a way of way of a way of extending the living room to make it appear bigger  by having a conservatory leading off it  via sliding doors

Mhm

uhm

Uhm

It 's actually quite attractive

Good 

He deals  I understand with matrimonial cases

Ah 

What costing divorce then 

Well  I suppose so

Uhm

Didn't John used to deal with uhm  divorce in his earlier days

Did he

uhm

uhm

Found it quite depressing

I imagine it probably is uhm

All the toing and froing and

I mean I I should think you 'd get over the uhm  the voyeuristic aspects in the early stages and uhm you 're really dealing with people 's lives pretty wrecked  and that can be very bitter in some cases 

Uhm

This cr&egrave;me fra&icircumflex;che frache certainly adds to the soup doesn't it

uhm

uhm

Nice soup

I like the bread

Uhm

Nice and seedy

Uhm

It 's it It 's not the three seeded one

It 's what they call the 

Yeah that 's right

Yeah

Their seed seeded batch loaf

Yeah

Batch loaf

No

Really

Ah seeded batch loaf

uhm 

uhm

I think it 's got a nice texture 

Uhm

And saut&eacute;ed in good quality virgin oil and then rubbed with garlic

It uhm  adds another dimension to the soup

uhm

Italian

Italian

No

Bottled in Provence

Well it could be Italian but it s it says bottled in Provence on the label which means nothing at all



 

Uhm

Though I don't suppose Monsieur Delors would admit to bottling Italian oil in Provence 

There 's an enormous racket going on with Edam cheese

Have you heard about that

No

What 's that

Well  Edam cheese has been exported

What 're all those

Pardon

All those things sticking up over there

What things sticking up

All those shoots sticking up

See on the

Haemocaelis

Yeah

Uh uh a whole load of them between the crab apple and the

Yes

Yes

Haemocaelis

Oh right

You 've got lots of them haven't you 

uhm

Ah yes they ten uh tend to be

Apparently uhm the the Dutch have been exporting Edam cheese in large quantities  to Germany  but via such exotic routes as Andorra in the Pyrenees and Tanzania in whichever country that lies

Uhm 

Tanzania

Mhm

Which coun what

But Tanzania 's a country

I know

Yes

I was being sarcastic

Oh right

OK good

Uhm  the reason being that uhm direct exports between  E E C countries uhm  does not attract any subsidy

but because the E E C is collectively concerned to increase its revenue with other trading blocs  a subsidy 's paid for exports sent to countries outside the bloc

Therefore if you if you whiz your Ed your boring Edam presumably down through France nip it into Andorra you 've gone outside the E E C I think because Andorra is not officially part of the E E C 

And you then send it to Germany

and somewhere along the lines someone collects an enormous amount of money which we are contributing to 

But it 's because it 's all been blown because uhm  because of the computer presumably which just threw up a sort of uh five thousand per cent annual increase in the export of uh Edam cheese to uh Tanzania and Andorra which yeah  which wouldn't actually be accounted for by normal sort of preferences

Mhm

Thank you

Oh right

Probably don't eat

uhm

Uhm

I mean if they were going to increase their cheese consumption then un unless it was the presentation of the product they wouldn't go for Edam would they 

Well it 's a matter of taste isn't it

Or not  in the case of Edam

In the case of Edam

Yes

You obviously don't think much of Edam

Well it 's a very boring sort of cheese isn't it

I mean it 's all right thinly sliced with a with an apple I suppose

uhm

Like Gruy&egrave;re

Well that 's entirely a different thing

Sounds as if you were really very disappointed that the uhm the tutor you made a good contact with wasn't there  and that you were wanted some continuity and that  you know you felt you 'd been trying to establish a framework and some foundations and  that you felt as if you could actually take it further with her 

And so you 're a bit disappointed

Well not just a bit  really 

And then then then the dilemma was whether you carry on as if he could take over or you 'd have to start all over again

And that 's  I  I I wonder if that has any relationship to your coming along to see me  because  there is an issue about whether you would actually gain more from seeing somebody more frequently than you can see me 

And uh actually weekly probably 

And really about whether you want to take that uh step 

Yes I was

Oh no

Yes

I think so

Well yes

I think I 've got to

Mm 

Because I think that what what happens when you come along to see me is you make use of it 

uhm  but maybe it feels like a long time between  appointments

Yes

Three weeks was very long 

I mean it 's just been crazy really

Mm

And it 's as if I 'm saying well everything is all right  uh but

But in fact you almost do

Well last time you you so nearly said

well carry on taking  the tablets that this is kind of dunno don't know whether to laugh or cry

Well I think that in some ways I am saying things are all right

But I know that they are not all right

I I can handle that underneath but confidentially because it 's not me that 's  got to act

but I I think the problem is for you  really

Sometimes I think I 'm making it all up 

And uh I 've seen manifested this whole way of behaving because  oh for I don't know for whatever reasons

And And now  I I don't know

I mean I just 

What more

Well what 's the difference 

Oh I could be able to just chuck it all away

What 's the difference between  What is the difference for you between experiencing it and feeling that you 've made it up

Because if I made it up because it had a purpose  then I should be able to stop it

And will keep you in control

Mm

Well also that means that 's a bit like carry on taking the tablets you know 

Everything 's all right really

This is just imagination  just imagination

Well I keep on asking people to believe that there really is something wrong and they just don't 

Which people 

Well like Greg who I used to go out with 

He was He just thinks it 's all a complete joke and I just want too much attention 

And even my mother 's kind of funny about it 

And I suppose they are people who know me  like on on one hand she is quite sympathetic you know

but then on the other hand she 's been oh must be getting her down because I still ring her a lot 

And  uh  uh uh then the other side she she obviously hasn't realised that I 'm not going to pass the year

Mmm 

Is that true

You 're not 

Well she said  that I am or I 'm not

What

But is it true that you are not 

If I go on like this I can't see how I can 

But if I can suddenly  snap out of it get really enthusiastic work sort of  at fifteen hours a day  then yes I could I can because

Mmm 

You mean it 's theoretically possible

Yes

Whose standards are you  invoking

By their standards

Not

I could not pass it in the way I would want to pass it  now 

I think that passing or failing the year is

I mean it 's obviously important

but I think somehow it 's a red herring 

Well she said it 's your decision you you know

We said we 've given you some money if you want to pay for an extra year

then if you want to 

And you know that means that they 're not 

How much money have they given you 

They have just given me enough to last this year  and next year which means that if I do an extra year the last year I have to work 

Well it would be really difficult too

I mean they 've done it and there 's ways round it

I could go external or I could get a job

And you know it 's like coming to see you

You see your tutor once every two or three weeks

I mean you just go to see them

Uh it 's   once you do one  

Well no

It 's not that it 's useless

it 's just difficult because you 're out

It it demands much more of you because you are out of the normal

Y You have even less contact

Just as useless



The problem for you is not the way other people view you 

That 's only part of the problem

And that that comes from you  as much as from them 

The problem is  is you sort of taking care of yourself really  and being concerned enough about yourself and wanting to do something about it 

uhm and that is and and and the struggle is that on the one hand you do want to be taken seriously and you get uh you feel mortified that it 's not taken seriously enough and on the other hand you get very worried if it 's taken seriously I don't uh uh uh th the you know because you then you feel all the worries that anybody does sometimes

But it does

I in In some ways what what  you know uh

I mean maybe maybe what I 've been offering has contributed to this  uncertainty uhm 

but I I d do feel that if  that you 're the one who needs to accept that there 's sufficient for you to be worried about to want to take it seriously

Yes

Yes

I do uh what I have to do 

I mean I 'm  I  I know I 'm I think if I could I know I sort of started out saying

I don't want to talk to anyone

I just want it to happen at its normal rate

But now I just know that I don't want that because I can't believe how addled it 's making me 

I I just feel that I 'm I 'm not engaging with people at all

When I go out I 've been going out because I don't want to work and I ought to have a normal life and I just can't really seem to have uhm  well I can have conversations but I feel completely disengaged

Mm

Mm 

Yeah 

Well you also I I I I think you need uh to see somebody frequently who whom you can shout at 

 I don't think I 'd shout at the moment

Well you might or you might not

But I But I think if you felt you wanted to

It sounds as if you felt you might have wanted to to me

but it 's a bit more difficult 

uhm  the the issue then is how you set about doing that

Have you  Maybe you need to try to do that through your G P locally  to begin with

It 's a question of whether you want uh whether you want private or N H S treatment 

And what difference does it make

Well N H S is free

Yes I know 

Apart from that

But you have to wait a long time 

I suspect unless you 're  lucky  uhm  private  is uh

It varies in  individual areas

I can't afford to pay for private

Has your father got private insurance

Not when 

No

He 's not even working now

Right

OK

Oh you mean like a medical policy

Mm

He used to be part of BUPA but when he was made redundant he  lost it

 

Yeah 

There There was this girl at my college who uhm 

she walked in in the middle of my Friday session which was the one that was the more positive  and uh  her whole family

Uh but she said because they were saying John

that was the one who said she 'd had something similar to say

Oh well you have to allow yourself to be depressed

and you can learn from depression

and you should go swimming when you feel depressed or do something

and don't worry about working

and all a normal sort of things 

And she walked in and said

and I I mean need  you know

I told her that I 'd had to take these tablets and that 's why I felt like I wasn't thinking properly

Then she said oh you must stop doing that

You know you always seem quite  normal

And then Meryl came in

and she said you know

if you want some help my whole family have come from this

And she rang up the other day to ask if I needed to see somebody and she could help and I said no 

I said that I I 'd wait and see if you could sort anything out and if if that didn't work then 

Yes

Mhm

Well I 've been trying to bring this girl into  U C H

I 've a contact

Uh I uh I have colleagues here uhm 

I think that  I think the reality is 

well you might be lucky  but the reality is that you 'd have to wait  uhm

How long wait

Well that I couldn't say

A year or 

I I really couldn't answer that

Don't they have things where they have students training and I think  start to do something like that



You start a placement

Or I or you they have ones which are means related

Oh yes 

It depends how 

Well if you want to get into that area there is no doubt that that is a possibility  but you 'd have to commit yourself to at least three times a week and you 'd have to commit yourself to two years

With the students you mean

Mm

Because the means related one you don't have to 

Uh my friend Caroline she goes once a week

and I think she pays five pounds each time she goes

That 's very reasonable well yes

Where is that at

I don't know

I can ask her

I dou doubt she 'd want me to go to the same place as her though because she is a bit possessive about things

uhm 

I mean I could go once a week possibly twice a week

but three times a week is just too much

Well I think you know that they interview trainees

That That 's what they do

And there 's  you see a student

you get actually good value because uhm 

You might say that

but I had to meet this girl who I haven't seen for ten years from my school

And she was awful when I knew her at school

And when I asked her what she 's taking she said uh she was becoming a psychiatrist

And I just sat there and I thought I can't think of anything wor anyone worse to do that job 

Yes I can I yes I know

That 's not a fairly common approach towards psychiatrists but I but I 

I mean what people are like isn't necessarily related to whether they 're good at their job to be quite honest uhm

Well her attitude was that it was easiest to get to the top 

And I then I said there 's less pus involved



 Yes

You know one one holiday we actually went to Turkey 

Uhm  well this is about twelve fifteen twenty years ago now  I suppose

And they 've got fantastic yoghurts there of course  and yoghurty drinks as well  and it 's all wasted on me totally wasted

Mm

Mmm

Mmm

Yes

It 's a  

But  really loved it

Yes

Yes

Yes

Greek yoghurt is fantastic

Yes it 's the same isn't it

Yeah 

You know yoghurt I 'm sorry

Yes Greek

I was thinking of Turkish yoghurt

 there was There was some something we ate in Turkey it was which was  fried aubergines and yoghurt I think

Oh lovely

Yeah 

Yes 

Well it 's a sort cos moussaka 's got uh aubergines in it hasn't it  and and cream

Absolutely delicious

Mm

I mean it 's virtually the same I suppose

Mm

Mm

Mm

You didn't come to Turkey with us did you

What no

You went to Greece though didn't you

Yes

Uh we went we went to uh Hagios Lindos

Lindos

Yes

Villa Rainbird

That 's right

Yes

Very good that I 'm sure

It was great

It was good actually

It was a fantastic villa

 are you going back there

Uh no

Are you going back are you

Ah 

Never return they say

Mm 

Was it the second time I 've  ever  ever been there

No

It was the third time I 've been to Lindos because we  we went to Lindos originally

I went 

Did you come with me

I went to Lindos once and slept on a beach there 

Yeah

No

I went with Richard and  David  and  and David Brook 

And we had about six weeks driving round 

Right

Yeah

Right

It was a similar sort of thing

And uh  we went to Lindos and stayed in a 

Well two two of them

Oh that 's right

David and The two Davids wanted to  stay under shelter 

And I think uhm  we went and slept on the beach or something

Uhm

Anyway the beach turned into a hotel when we were there

Yeah

That 's right

Yeah

I mean it 's awful

Well we had

When did we go back

so we went back 

Trish and I went back with the kids



Really

Yeah

You didn't tell us about it

Yes we did actually

Yes

They ha

I  something was mentioned

Mhm

Uhm  and I can't remember what

We couldn't afford it any more

It was quite an expensive holiday

Was it 

For us 

Because then you 'll be going out for a meal and that

Probably  probably  the weekend

You know

Uhm I mean mean I obviously couldn't

It was difficult

That was all

Things improve in the memory but I I it was very splendid wasn't it 

I mean the lovely beds and lovely uh terrace overlooking the harbour

and we can see Spiros

Yeah



Mm

You could see the gutters

Jill was there taking her temperature

That 's right

And we flew kites 

And Alastair wasn't very old

How old Alastair how old was he

two or something

Two and a half uhm

Two

Yes

Two

And Tricia said he knew his right hand from his left hand now and I was really impressed  because I may have told you



Well you 've got a fifty per cent chance of being right 

Right 

Of course with the stress of Pat and Tony standing over him it must be no wonder he 

 then telling us his children are supposed to be continent at one

That 's a conditioned reflex isn't it

You sit them on a cold lavatory and they evacuate their bowels

Well wouldn't you under those circumstances

It 's a  stress-related phenomenon 

If we both sat on a cold lavatory seat we 'd evacuate the bowels  

D' you You don't go skiing do you  

  on the ski slope thank goodness 

There is uh There 're remarkable stories aren't there about these people women 

I mean everybody knows about these stories don't you

People going uh skiing deciding they want to have a wee  uh slipping down their ski things on a slope and then  as they 're s crouching the skis start to move and they actually  stumble backwards into the middle of the snow again  bare bottom the lot you know

Mm

Mm

That 's the vanishing hitchhiker really though isn't it 

If you know what I mean

Vanishing hitchhiker

Yes

It 's ur urban myths 

There 's been a book several books published on the concept

And it it 's actually really very interesting uhm  because you have these myths which in fact when you  follow them right down to the root source don't exist at all  which we all know about and which I 've read lots of times in newspapers

I mean the classical one 's the person who microwaves their poodle to dry it

Urban myths

Mm

Mm

Yes

Yes that 's right

That 's right

The person who has bees in their hair uh what

When we had bouffant hairstyles

Uh 

Oh yes

That 's right

There are cockroaches crawling around inside even if you have grates

Uhm uh uhm crocodiles in the lavatories in the toilets you must have come across that 

Uhm

Yes yes yes true 

People who are particularly lonely

Uhm

And it they nearly always

And it happened to my uncle 

Very close relative

Yes yes yes

Friend of a friend

Yes

Oh I know who it was exactly

Mm 

And if you keep your eyes open you actually you 'll see them in the papers as as as facts 

And of course none of them really exist at all

Mm

So who invents them

And they  quickly become stories which become part of the folklore I mean I I guess that 's never happened

Someone said wouldn't it be funny if someone squatted down on the ski slope in bare skin

And it then  becomes part of a of a series of jokes or raconteurs ' tales you know

and then it becomes part

and you say

oh I know someone who said that

and then it becomes real

I can't think of one at the moment

There have been one or two which  you you you pick up quite frequently  

Uhm 

Oh yes there 's the famous one I read in there were two famous ones which I read in the newspapers

One was the uh adulterer one 

Uhm  chap works uh with this uh called Readymix Cement right 

And he thinks his wife is having it off with someone else 

He 's stand He comes back home

He sees this Mini parked outside  and the light on in the bedroom and these two people going hammer and tongs

And he thinks right I 'll get the bastard

So he gets hold of his  ready mixed cement  fills up the whole of the Mini with cement right rings the doorbell and says and shouts you know  hello I 'm home you know

Screams and crashing you know 

So he just runs up the stairs out the back door shoots onto the bicycle next door 

Bicycles off  

I read that in the paper  so it must be true 

Mm mm mm

Yes

Right

Yes

Yes

Right

Yes

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm

Cement

Hello 

Uhm uhm what was the other one that uh 

There 's the vicar under the car

The vicar

Oh oh the vicar one

There 's the vicar one

Again a marvellous story

Uhm this  wife  comes back to see her husband underneath the car uhm  repairing the car 

So so she thinks I 'll give him a surprise

So she uh undoes his fly buttons grabs hold of his penis you see

and the chap underneath the car goes  hits sits sits up hits his head underneath the car knocks himself unconscious

She goes rushing into the house to call an ambulance

There 's her husband  

Who was that under the car

Oh he says it 's the vicar who is coming to help me to mend the car 

Really it 's got a sort of music hall ring about it in fact

Yes

Yes

Definitely



People seem to come out with those stories

I heard of someone who was repairing a car and he

Yes

Yes

That 's right

Yes 

Yes

Yes

 Yeah 

Mm

And in fact I 've got this book

I think it 's called The Vanishing Hitchhiker because it 's about uh uh

It 's probably written in America originally because uh we don't come across this myth in this country about this hitchhiker chap this cold winter day

and he takes some hitchhiker who either disappears during the journey at a point where someone was killed

or there 's the hook isn't it where there 's some hook involved where a person 's been hung up by the hook or something really weird

And anyway this book is called The Vanishing Hitchhiker

and he 's analysing this because he thinks this is a new form of folklore

and where did the folklore st where do stories come from originally

Uhm is there a grain of ss truth in some of the stories

You know Hansel and Gretel

I mean if you read uhm what was the the uh the the uh the writer who wrote that book on nursery rhymes   the Opies where they look at the uh realities behind some of this sort of myth

I mean it 's very similar to  these nursery rhymes if you looked at its causes sample-wise

Yes

Yes yes

Yes

Mm  Mm  Mm

Mm

Opay

Opie

Mm mm mm

Mm mm



Yes

I know if something happens to my father he does recount it once and if you 're there you know about it and that sounds great

Then the next week you 're still there but you you you hear him say it again and it 's totally different

It 's grown into a nice big story

Oh absolutely

And the viewpoint 's changed

and all sorts of things



The viewpoint

Well perhaps you have 



Well well I tend to repeat almost exactly the same stories to my friends

If something funny 's happened I 'll  try it out more or less in the same way on everybody else

and my children stand there going 

Yes yes

 

I mean there there are really good storytellers

And I mean I I I 'm not

But I mean not only can they put accents and change positions which is always very interesting

but they the actual stories sound terribly simple

and they embellish them in such a way that they become incredibly funny

You know one thing follows on to another

There are people who are terribly good at doing that 

Uhm  I can never remember jokes easily

I mean we have friends who come and they 're always cracking jokes one after another

Mm mm

Mm mm

Mm mm

I know

And they put on the right accents 

Ah it 's marvellous

Yeah

Timing 's good 

Timing is so difficult though

Yes

Mm 

Well I was fascinated when uh uhm  my children were small and they went to school and they learnt this thing about eeny meeny miney mo

Uh I used to say

catch a nigger by the toe 

and they learnt 

get a tiger off your toe

Oh yes that 's right

And when I when I thought about it cos I thought it was supposed to be any conversation  that we had had during the week 

So I hadn't looked on it as a particular task that I was fulfilling 

I just sort of looked at various conversations

And in fact then when I started I decided which conversation I was going to analyse or try to analyse because I thought that was what I was supposed to be doing

And then I wasn't quite sure of how to analyse it when it came down to it

So it starts off and I I wrote it all down

And I cou I couldn't  tell you what I thought about

Mm

Mm

Can we just check that that 's what we 're  you what in fact you 've done

What I 've  the work I 've done all those years must be looked at as a sector of your life

So I chose an episode  just something that had happened to me 

So rather than just looking at the language  and then

Yes

Yes

I did too

I chose more an episode than a language

 conversation

And then uhm  even though I 'd started to do some sort of basic homework on a subject I know nothing about other than reading it I thought I 'd apply my own way into things which was to look at it from 

Do you want coffee

Yes

As I 've already said I 'm halfway there 

Uhm so I kind of uhm approached approached it with a theatre model as if the three people involved in the episode were three characters and I was rehearsing the scenes with them 

 a way that I might look at analysing three characters in the scene if they were fiction 

So  I 've got only one one way into that  and uhm  which I which I  explained to him

Uhm so it was so I was sort of going from my own kind of experience from when I 

Yeah

Yes

Yeah

Yeah 

Cos I 've got another  in in mind of what you said

And I 've thought how needs  this conversation needs

And I wasn't sure when I thought that whether we were supposed to be looking at  skills  you know whether we were needing to persuade someone or  or quite what we were you know trying to get out of this conversation

So sort of halfway through I suppose I I started to think

well am I supposed to be looking at what I want to get out of the conversation or what the other person wants to get out of this conversation because this could be totally different actually

And then there 's that whole thing that 

I mean I 've  

she 's about identified how  communication is

But then there 's this whole thing of you actually  you work on a certain amount of  understanding of what you 're aiming to get out of this situation

and of course  it 's completely different because it 's all assumptions as to what  and where the other persons are

That 's why I felt that I was a character

Yeah

It is

It is

Exactly 

That that was quite new

I mean actually you 've therefore taken a model haven't you which you produced 

Yeah

That 's why I thought a good idea was to try and apply  some sort of a model

So I designed a model but it might have nothing whatsoever to do with this course 

Yeah

Some sort of model

That was that was pretty good actually

Because I didn't really think a model to  base it on

What did you do

I pondered on it quite a lot and found it you know realised that I didn't really understand what I was supposed to be doing

Exactly

Just as you said

Yeah

And then I thought well I can take an everyday incident or conversation and analyse that

But the problem was that ha having gone into a conversation not with the prime purpose of analysing it but just thinking oh I had a bit of a dialogue with someone  then getting into the dialogue and forgetting completely that that 's what I was supposed to be doing and then on the other side of it not remembering what I 'd said in order to be able to analyse it

So in the end I just thought this is ridiculous this is only the starting-point and if I 'm going to make such a meal out of every exercise I 'll never complete the course

So I said I 'm doing what I 'll do is what I 'll do is I 'll just take this conversation that I haven't been sure of and and the outcome and how I felt about it and how I expected the other person felt about it  and that 's it

I mean I haven't written it down or anything

That 's right

I can recall it a little bit

Yeah

Yes

I had the same problem because if I was going to be accurate and there 's so many  about it I 'd want to rec 

When you get into every detail

And then I thought

well I 've only to get one one small conversation

and I thought

well if I wrote this as a script you know for these purposes it wouldn't like be a theatre script because theatre scripts just have lines  interpreting some T V script right  because T V scripts have camera angles  and uhm

and also there 's the dressing

you know you can put much more detail into them

And I thought oh well maybe not

Maybe I 'll just treat it as a work of art i e you find a f form and you  and you 're liberal with it  because it it has that impact on you and you 're the author of it so you 're allowed to be you 're allowed to be unscientific and a bit broad with it

To record it

Yeah

And you 've got the 

And in the end you you are going to be describing it to us

You 're the only person who was there

So  you and yeah

and it 's based on your memory 

So even if you write it down as a script it 's still only going to be what you could in fact actually tell us 

Yes

There are occasions where

Yes

So your your range of events or you know whatever it is for emphasis is going to be from you anyway 

So you could actually say

and then I saw the look in his eyes when I said that which is part of the communication which you don't actually write it down

It 's an odd thing uhm

There 's there 's an odd thing that I don't know what it 's

it 's something to do with when I 

I 've studied you know how people can write novels you know authorial voices and all this 

So you get one one authorial voice you see that might be this

There 's three basic kinds

There 's one that says you know it 's the author

Dickens usually does that

You usually know it 's Dickens writing Dickens

And then there 's the one where they pretend there 's no author there like George Eliot where where it 's al  it 's almost as if they 're pretending they 've put 2-or-3-words there and objective

And there 's the one that 's through the character  uhm which is  or something like that which is uh  one where you draw a narrative you know that one  Jane Eyre

Yeah

Jane Eyre

Right 

So so they 're pretending they 're the character or

I 've just done work on Frankenstein which is extraordinary for that  because it 's  Mary Shelley pretending to be a captain who then pretends to tell a story  who then

the captain then pretends to be  uhm Victor Frankenstein and then Victor Frankenstein then says and then the monster said to me

So you 've got four different perspectives  distorting them as they say the story

First

You know I 've never read Frankenstein

I must read it 

Terrible isn't it

It 's all I 've seen the film and everything else

Then that 's the problem you may have come across

Haven't you

 perspective  and show them how distorted 

Yeah

So do do we decide here for the purpose of this exercise that it 's our eyes

Uhm we haven't got much of a choice

Well I don't think that we have actually

No 

No 

I think perhaps having decided  uh we 'd all made our separate decisions hadn't we and obviously had similar problems in deciding how we were going to go about this

Oh well I think in understanding it to start with that was the main problem

Yeah

Mhm

But now that we know how we 've each  come to the conclusion as to what we 've done

Like what 's your conversation like

Yes

Uh my conversation was going in on Saturday morning into a shop where I was picking up some things that were due to be framed

And I went in

And I had a very very busy Saturday

This of course is an important bit of of background information

So everything was tightly scheduled through my Saturday to achieve  a whole lot of things

and went in to the people that I I knew and I 've have been using for some years and said

and he came out and he said oh it 's not ready 

And he said well well can you come back in half an hour

And I said no I can't

And I 'd also taken back something that I 'd collected the previous Saturday with the hope of it being done correctly

So I went in with a bone of of complaint if you like

Bone of contention

And then he came out and said it wasn't ready

So  a lot of anxiety and crossness and feeling let down was coming out

So  I said oh no

That 's that 's so annoying

And so he then said well it will only be fifteen or twenty minutes if you 'd like to come back

And then I showed him what was wrong with the other one

So he then said to me  I 'll drop it round to you 

And it was very strange because my reaction to that was oh no

No

That 's all right

I 'll come back next Saturday cos I felt I was putting out him out

And I I said no

It 's all right

It 's not urgent

It doesn't really matter

It 's just annoying for me

He said well no we don't want you to have to come back twice

We don't like customers to feel let down

I 'll come and and deliver it to you

And then another uh sort of block to that came from me

In fact I 'm going to be out all day

I 'm not going to be back until six

And so he then said but I don't finish here until six anyway

And I then said and I have to go out at seven

So it would have to be between six and seven

He said that 's all right

I 'll I 'll come between six and seven

So I said well that 's awfully nice

And I went out with a smile on my face 

And I I thought I don't know really how to analyse that other than the fact that uhm it was very good customer relations

Uhm and I felt that I my responses were very negative and he continued to knock them down until he caused me to accept what his uhm uhm uh his response to it was and which I was in the end very pleased about 

Yeah

Say who you are

Not who your ages or your

John Major 's not  John Major 's  going to be rather ashamed about this

Who  

Ha ha ha ha

Sorry

Really

That seriously is the only one in fact

Not with his private secretary

No no no no

No

You shouldn't say things like that

That loudspeaker should be under your nose 

No

three-or-four-words

I i it is

it i

there is a rumour going around that it 's some something that you might that that that you you you know the other half 

Alistair I mean 

I I I 've heard that I I I I he I heard that story as well

Oh I

a fairly obvious one 

And it 's amazing that there are not more people saying it

What

Sounds like quite a high yeah last week

Who 's having 

It is a story it is a story that goes round but it hasn't actually been published



Oh excellent

Can we hear it 

Yes come on 

We 've started

Come on Alec

I must pr I don't read Private Eye unless Private Eye 

It isn't in Private Eye

I 'm sure I read it in the paper

Well it 's a

Well it 's a fairly obvious one that if he chooses a woman to be the head of his  his main advisor 

Yes

He 's having it off doubtless

Oh all right

Oh no I 'm so confused now

Oh I do

I know I know who  it is now

Do you

You know who 

Brenda Sch is it Brend is it Brenda Schwarzkopf

And you liked her too Bert

Or have I got the right one

I 'm sure it is 

Who are we on about Sarah

John Major 's having an affair with Brenda Schwarzkopf

 



We 've got there now

What 's that

Well

We 've got there now

He 's meant to be the sexiest man in  in America 

 

Do you fancy him three-or-four-words

So if someone comes up and says

Nigel you look like 

John Major

No Norman

Oh Norman

Storming Norman 

Oh 

Yes he is

He is rather 

Is he is he your ideal man

He 's well funnily enough he 's quite cosy

I can see that

Oh

What is what is that man called

Ben Jonson

I think basically people like Wells well played fellows

Yes

He 's got a big 

Oh

 

Oh Magic Johnson

Magic Johnson

Well built players

Oh definitely

Or more stamina than me

Is he jealous of  women 

I don't like bony things

Give you a bit of a 

That 's right

No they 

Yeah

Must be terribly  

Thank you

Yeah 

Don't know how he man managed that and and played good class  at the same time he can catch





Is that

Well  

Well I 'm not

That 's the whole point

I 've been running all through the day

I think it 's one way of one way of keeping you fit actually



When I cook I just use I use 

Ten thousand plus women

That 's right

What 's wrong with Tommy though

He 's got one one for every day of the year

Let 's eat this smoked salmon

Let 's get it on the bare plate 

You  on a plate

Mm



I 'm finished with the 

Mm 

It 's gone

That 's much better

Cos he wouldn't dare take it from you



That 's so no that 's really unkind

Sorry

But she had to go to the loo

Didn't didn't

That 's horrible

I think that 's really nasty 

When I come home when I come home  to supper and I I expect my my mummy and daddy to be exceptional which they never are

I mean nick my salmon 

I shall never come home again

But do you go home to your mother and  tell her the sort of things that

No

Never

No

I never go home anyway so

It is a  

Your father actually is up to just about every trick that 's in the book and 

What

What what d' you say

That is on the practical joke front

Oh yes 

Is that OK

At least it 's not a

I pinched a tomato there 

Sorry

Hasn't changed much



No

What are you doing Bert 

I 'm walking into the dining room so I can sit down



Yes

I need it upstairs 

You need brushing up

Yeah

Attending to your person 

Are you being recorded

Mm

I know

There 's a nice bit of conversation

Yeah



You would do

Yeah

Terry well you 've missed out on all the juicy bits

 

No

Mostly

We touched on your love life

They apparently just cut the first few minutes because to get  business

But that didn't last very long between me and you



No but I wonder how he deals with it 

It 's going to be it 's going to be a sort of



Sorry

What if it stopped 

I hope he didn't

I 'd be very upset if it was 

Mm

It 's  all my little  

My ideals end 

  

I think he sounds extremely nice

Mm

Do you like him

No

Somehow he looks nice

No

Mm

He 's got that lip

Mm 

He just grins

He 's got a funny upper lip though 

Has he 

We can't all be perfect 

He happens to shave three times a day

No

But he 's  than most

 

Did you hear that

Well if he if he needs to shave three times a day I think he just needs to shave five times a day 

You behave like a 

No

But it 's funny

I i it 's odd 

Chatting her up

But what you mean is

No

It 's a problem

If you shave too often  you get blue bearded there



Mm

You y you en you encourage it no end

Yep

You do 

Or you start taking the skin off 

I never had to do that

No 

That 's why I don't overdo it you know 

How far up do you go

Only do it once a week 

It 's just a matter of three-or-four-words

Do you think that 's why Robert doesn't 

Oh Robert

No

I think Robert 's just too lazy

Robert 's not the cleanest shaved person I 've seen 

He and he and Edward Trotter have sort of 

He 's going to have to be

When you when when Robert goes into d goes to Disneyworld one of the things there 's two things

What 's he going to do in Disneyworld

He 's going to be Mickey Mouse

Don't know 

He 's going to be a cast member as they 're called  



He 's going to be Mickey Mouse

Uhm but w one of the

Apparently there 's an article in the last one of the magazines and it said that the one thing that was absolutely anathema was hair anywhere on the face

Couldn't have that 

And the other thing absolutely de rigueur is deodorant because it 's sort of all presenting an ideal world 

so hair on the face and smelly armpits don't do 

Mm

The gnomes

Mm

I 'd never get a job

I can imagine 

And does Robert know about this three-or-four-words

Terrible disappointment

I don't know

I actually kept it

  

Oh

Yeah

I kept it in case he wanted to see it

But how did it happened

He got a job

But what made him want to go to Disneyworld for the job

Well he he rang me up in great excitement  a few months ago and said Mum I 've had my yes I 've had my first job interview 

And I said

who with

And he said Eurodisney

And and actually they offered him a job

This is at Eurodisney

Oh Eurodisney

Oh that 's wonderful

Paris it is isn't it

Yeah

Yes

It is

Yes

It 's very exciting

How lovely

Very

Mm

A friend of mine worked as a construction uhm uhm 



I understand Suffolk

No

They do have they do do some funny things

I understand Suffolk whereas she doesn't understand br broader border Scots

Border Scots is quite seriously difficult

Scots

Yes

Well I know it 's got traces of other languages

Well it 's got different words

Yes

Sort of it 's sort of Geordie as well as Scottish

A bit bit of G bit of Geordie and and  some something from from overseas sneaks in somewhere 

But it 's much more much more Norse

There 's lots of different words

Yeah

Norse

Yes

That 's right 

I think I think that 's probably probably correct

And the the  there 's been an enormous connection with the Low Countries  and Newcastle 

Newcastle and North you you fi find uhm there 's a marvellous walled garden I don't know where it is  with hyacinths

and your the walled garden must belong to a  pre-dated house

And it it 's lovely mellow Dutch bricks  and it all came over as as the ballast in a boat  which was taking wool or something back 

Appar apparently they had to bring something to trade the other way and  and their bricks were they were definitely Dutch bricks 



Do you want to sit down



Really

Yes

I 've never been round Berwick

It sound uh it looks rather

You should do that 

Sorry 

Sorry can I interrupt you

Uhm some white wine for Mrs Beak Beak

Mm

There 's a bottle of Bordeaux open and sitting on a shelf

It looks as though it might have been open for quite a long time 

I 'd op open the wine bag 

Open the wine

The box

Mm 

So B Berwick

I mean it 's

You should go there

It 's a very 

No

Carry on

Cheers 

We could do that

I mean it 's got very very fine Elizabethan  walls

Oh I 'd love to see that 

Almost entirely complete 

And they were reinforced then because of uhm  the Scots

That 's right

Because of the 

so that the clans which might be outflanking from North I suppose and 



I can't remember when it became English took over

Fifteen thirty-five or something

Thirteen thirty-three

You can talk about after the battle of Harraden Hill

Is this Berwick

Oh really 

The the s the Scots were besieging  I think uh uh Berwick and Edward whoever it was at the time came out to relieve it

And they  the English formed up on Harraden Hill which is on the it 's the Berwickshire side of Berwick  in in a star-shaped formation

And the s the Scots came to relieve their  their insurgent forces  and walked right into the  in into the s s star

And it was su supposed to be the first u recorded use of controlled firepower if you 're a mil military man

Oh and they they blew a trumpet and in order to fire the arrows see



Yes

Yes



Mm

Into the star

At one time

Yes

Waited right till they they were right inside just about to chop the archers down 

and then they fired

Oh hello  you found your way 

Emma Smith

Yes thanks

Yes

Mike Millican

Do come in 

Do hang your coat up if you 'd like to 

Mmm 

Right 

Uh do sit down 

OK thank you

I 've got your  uh form here

You 've completed the P H D

is that right

Are you actually working now

Yes

Uh  no I 'm just doing little odd jobs here and there

Just sort of  right OK  eh

And I I finished in December so I 've been

Right

And  you spent two years in India

Nearly two years yes

Mm mmm 

How can I help you

What are you  looking for this morning 

Well  I think what I 've realised looking at sort of jobs that are advertised  is that because I don't have much work experience  and uh it 's not a particularly easy time for finding jobs I think people are just not interested full stop

so I have a feeling that I 've got to sort of carve some  niche for myself in terms of

yeah  uhm  were you  looking for jobs and making this uh

Oh in mainly  the Guardian I suppose is the main place

OK  certainly if you are looking for jobs uh in the Guardian or or the uh national press  most of the adverts there will be for people with experience because that 's where you advertise for people with experience

Uhm  there are uh  potentially a lot of jobs available for  new graduates or new postgraduates without work experience but they tend not to be advertised there 

so you are in a problem there 

If you if you respond to those ads  they 'll be looking for people with experience

Yeah

Yeah

Mm mmm

Yes

Mm mmm

Yeah  yeah

So where are the other ads you know 

Well it 's through the  the university sort of system  uhm 

I mean if it 's the big companies you 're looking for then they will be on the milk round

They 'll be the people who recruit one-or-two-words-obscured-by-noise

The smaller companies uh still do recruit lots of people new graduates new postgraduates without experience but they tend not to advertise in the Guardian at all 

So the thing really is to identify I think the areas of interest for you and then to approach them in a different way than waiting for an ad in the Guardian

Mm mmm

No

Mmm

Mmm 

Well the areas of interests what I 've got anyway  I mean

Right

Uhm  and you say here writing B B C  museums  and so on

Yeah 

Right 

Do you have the background information on all or any of these

I mean  museums I have uh some kind of background in just because the work that I was doing was quite closely affiliated with museums and stuff

Uhm  I mean I 'm applying this week for a job at the V and A

and I 've already been told there 's a strong internal candidate  in the India department

and that I was told by the head of the department

so

Right  right

But it it 's specific bit like India Department that you feel

Well yes I mean the idea is I 'm not interested really in uh museums more generally

I mean I wouldn't be interested in a more sort of

OK so it 's a limited number of museums

Very limited

I mean actually ethnographic museum work is very limited

Right right 

There is a field in which my qualifications would be serious rather than ridiculous 

Right  OK uhm so it 's places like the V and A

Are there are there other places

Well there 's the Museum of Mankind but I don't think anyone 's about to leave there

I mean that would be the place I 'd love to work but uh  you know it 's supposed to be very limited 

Do they know of your interest

No I haven't I haven't uh contacted them 

Uh  it may be worth your while 

I mean uh uh writing speculatively is  uh never an enormously promising thing 

but in a very re restricted field it may be worth while letting them have a C V and letting them know that you know you are available  because although it 's a very restricted area there 's probably also a very restricted number of candidates

Mmm

Mmm

Mmm

Yeah

Yes yeah

Fairly restricted but not that much   not that restricted

Aha

OK

So it may be worth  uhm pushing a C V round to a few related   places like that

Mm  mm 

Other uh uhm  Museum of Mankind

I don't know where that is

Where is that

It 's in Piccadilly 

OK 

Are there other ones 

Well uh apparently there 's going to be a new museum called the Museum of Empire which is going to be some sort of thing on  colonial history the kind of museum that would be quite interesting

but that

you know that 's a sort of plan for the future

That 's a project

Yeah it 's a project

Whose project is it

Uhm  I 'm not sure

I mean I think there 's two people involved in it

I can find that out

I mean there are two people involved in it at the moment but uh  you know I think they are certainly not employing people yet you know but

Mmm

Again uh  if they know that you are available and with your background  it it 's worth letting them know

Mmm

Mmm

Getting in touch with them first yeah

Mmm

Uhm 

I mean otherwise in a way I mean I 'm more interested in writing in a way than I am in museums

but 

Right

OK well that 's covered touched on museums

How about writing 

Well  uhm the problem with writing is money   and  because you 're very unlikely to get  someone to uh  commission you to write something unless you 've already written  and published quite a lot which I haven't although my thesis is

I mean Thames and Hudson have expressed an interest and it 's possible I would be able to publish something out of that but you know all that takes a very long time

Yeah

And uh uh that 's obviously at an academic uh level and that 's  not going to be enormously commercial

Well  uhm  I wrote my thesis in such a way that it 's  considerably more accessible than most people 's

I mean it 's quite  amusing and it 's got a lot of visual material in it and stuff like that

so the idea is to try and publish it in a in a much more commercial publishers than the normal 

I mean not the sort of C U P O U P kind of thing

So uhm I mean if Thames and Hudson took it on that would actually be fairly  fairly commercial 

It 'd be great

They do actually sell books

Mm mmm

Mm mmm  mm mmm

Mm mmm  OK  OK

But other writing

Well I 'm interested in 

I I mean I 've done a bit of journalistic writing but not that much but uhm  I mean I 'm interested in all sorts of writing

I 'm interested in eventually trying to write a novel which I I have the material for

I haven't got the time and money to do it uhm 

You 've got the time but not the money maybe

Well I haven't got the time because I 've been doing little jobs  uh which take up just as much time as any other job uhm  so I haven't got time either 

I mean obviously I can write academic articles 

I can't see much point in doing it at the moment because  you don't get paid for it  

It 's it only counts as prestige and I don't really want to follow  an academic path 

But my problem is that all my qualifications point me straight in the academic line

Uh that 's right

Right

 yes

Well yes yes

They do I mean  you know of the things I 'm applying for

Well qualifications

uh obviously they do because you 've taken a P H D and and that that does point you towards academia

but  lots of people uh in all sorts of uh  disciplines after a P H D tend to move out and start completely different sorts of careers

yeah

Mmm

Mmm  yeah 

Oh I 'd like to 

Uhm 

Writing uh apart from from uhm 

you know the book 's there and

and academic writing uhm any other writing  

I mean can you can you generate articles

Mmm

Yeah I mean I 'm interested in

I can do  I think feature articles and I 've done

and I 've done two quite big feature articles illustrated which I published in Bombay but in quite sort of  good quality  uh sort of cultural magazines that have 

Uhm and I could probably do that here

I mean I haven't tried to do here yet uhm 

but I mean that that sort of journalism feature journalism interests me but not sort of hard core politics uh current events journalism really cos I don't think I 'm  pushy enough for you know a kind of network of grubby 

Right

Right

OK but that 's  writing rather than perhaps you know being a a journalist  and and you can be a freelance raffer wri freelance writer you know

Yes that 's a point

Uhm or uh there is  uh the possibility of  editorial journalism for uh magazines you know

Yes  there is 

The problem is I suppose I 've I 've  been in a fairly privileged position of not having to uh  to do too much of what I don't like 

I mean I

When I sort of look seriously into applying for sort of  that that sort of job you know it 's the kind of with girlie women 's magazines sort of aged thirteen up put your lipstick on sort of thing

and when it actually comes to it I just  am not interested

Absolutely

Sham

Uhm uhm I mean a lot of the magazines are like that

The the two that I looked into were

one was like that

the other was you know  how to do your knitting pattern

and strangely enough my qualifications look quite relevant because of their titles and things  you know about dress and perfume and stuff like that

but in fact they are nothing

you know they are not really

Right OK but uhm  yeah there would be l

I mean those are the commercial the very commercial ones  uhm 

but there are very wide ranges of magazines produced

Uhm  others  well to some extent cover the sort of areas that you are more interested in perhaps 

I mean uh either it it 's sort of general editorial work which is going to cover a wider range than your specific interests in anthropology 

or if you want to write in in anthropology then they are going to be you you 're going to be doing the writing the the articles for other people to publish I guess  in in this country or or or wherever

And it could cover all sort of aspects couldn't it I mean travel and uh  background human interest and things like that

Mm

Mm

Mm mmm

Mm

Mm

Yes

Mm

Mm mmm

But how does one I mean how does one start something like that

This is the problem 

You uh  have  ideas and a synopsis for actual articles  uh  and you submit them to uh  to magazines 

I mean most of the writing done for magazines is uh freelance work

They 're not done by staff writers

Mmm

Mm

Yes

Yeah  I mean I have thought of maybe tried trying to do something for a Sunday  Sunday paper magazine but I find I don't know what you think of it

I I thought it was probably better to actually write the thing first and send it to them than than to just contact them  I mean because they always want proof of one 's work

and uh

Yeah

Absolutely

I mean uh uh yes they they will want some  proof that you have written that you can write and so on

Yeah

Do you want to have a go at this

Yes please

I do

Put them in the middle

And we 've got to shuffle these three times

Do you mean you

You me you 

No

Each of us has got to do it three times

Oh each

Oh Christ

Me you me you me you

So I won't go on too long

Here we are

Right OK

One

Mm

Nothing worse than getting  are they in uh did you check whether there are any inverted cards or is that just too late

It doesn't matter

I usually ignore them if they 're inverted so

Oh do you

Yes

Oh well

To you

Too complicated for me 

I 'm not skilful enough to be tactful about inverted cards yet 

But I but I

I think your book on the medicine cards does that very well

I mean when the cards are inverted they still get a positive message out of the cards

That 's very good

Yes

Yes yes

Like wh yes what you can do is put three in a chain

Yes

And there 's no death card which is  basically less nervous

Yes

I remember when the very first medicine card I I chose was the ant

and I was incredibly disappointed at that

and then I read what the ant was being the homebuilder and this  and I

and I I le I haven't killed an ant since

So it was rather wonderful

I spent hours in the kitchen kind of scooping them onto card and shoving them out the windows rather than killing them

Yes

Yes

Yes

I get rather squeamish about it

I brought a wasp up from Speldhurst with me

It escaped on the underground and it got out this poor wasp so far  far from home

And it was on the window and I thought pe perhaps I ought to kill it because somebody 'll get stung and then I thought no why shouldn't it have at least a chance even if it does sting everybody

So I I just left it

You 'd think in a previous state I probably would have just squashed it

Yes

Mm 

That 's my second turn isn't it

Yes

I 've done it twice 

Right

So this is the last time then

Yes

I love the way they they refer to everything as all all our relations in including the stars and like the great star nations and our relations with 

Yes yes yes

Right

My last shall I shuffle the cards 

OK 

That 's it

Right

Uhm

I 've had two bananas

Is that all right

Yes

Since you 're not having anything else you can have two of everything 

Uhm 

Right

There 's the significator of you 

Now then you turn up the first card  from there and you cover your card

Uhm  that 's what covers you

That 's the general influence in your environment at the moment 

I 'm a total pig

Love them

What is it

Two of sticks

Two of

Yah

Two of wands

Ah wands 

Hmm

Hmm

But it 's called sticks in mahjong

Uh bamboo sticks that 's what they uhm

Sticks

Oh really

Oh yes

What the four different corners of the uhm sort of board or the wall that you see

Uhm

No

They have a suite yes

And one of the they have uhm Chinese characters

circles and bamboo sticks are the three hands as it were like

Ah there are three of them

Yes

Yes

Does that convey anything to you

He 's got a globe in his hand

He looks fairly contemplative in a way

He sort of

Mm

One hand is one wand is up and one wand looks planted

And he 's up on a parapet looking out

Mm yeh 

Yes you see

Well I 'm up in my eyrie uhm  contemplating the world at the moment in a way

On a des I 'm not really part of the world at the moment in so far as I haven't got a job and I 'm not  out

Yes

Mm 

I wonder why he 's holding a globe

So you 're in a quiet uhm 

It says here it looks like the sadness of Alexander amidst the grandeur of the world 's wealth

Yes

Mmm

Ah well

I 'm broke 

This may be the influence that 's covering you at the moment then 

Yes

He does look sort of s well contemplative

I said didn't I

not sad

but

Mm

Yes 

Well that seems fair enough

Right the next card is what crosses you

This is a to see what crosses you

Mm yes

That 's

Literally the next one  down

Yes

The one underneath that one

Mm

Queen of Cups 

Ah

Well she 's the Queen of water and she 's a rather dreamy  individual  uhm dreamy and imaginative 

See what it says here 

All you see is visions

Mm

Mm

Is she a good woman 

Mm

Everywhere gives solace 

And now you 're in a contemplative state

Yes

It looks as though she 's verging on the dreamy

Yes

Do you think that applies to you at the moment

Well it does in a way cos I am changing thinking about change a lot and having done this massage course which I 've got my uh assessment on Sunday

and then I do my anatomy and physiology and all the rest of it 

Uhm and I am doing a year at the year psychotherapy course at Spectrum next year

So I am 

Yes yes

Mm

Yes

Mm

Well that all seems to go with him actually I think

you think somehow

Uhm 

And imaginative 

I mean I do  dream a lot I suppose in a way

Let 's see that one when it 's reversed 

Mmm not 

I 'm just going to top up my tea again if you don't mind

A distinguished woman but one not to be trusted

Do you know anybody like that

Oh 

Gosh

A distinguished woman but one not to be trusted

No I don't think I I can't think of anybody particularly

Maybe you should be a bit wary

Yes

I mean I 'm going to see a play next week with an actress friend of mine in it who is now who 's doing very well now

thank you very much

Whether

Oh

Who 's that

J Jo

Jo Lumley who 's you know doing the Revenger 's Tragedy

And uhm I 'm being taken to see that  to go and see her afterwards 

Uhm 

Oh yes

Oh yes

Mm

Mm well

So I don't know why I thought of her

Then of course distinguished

Distinguished 

She got

Just distinguished

She 's she 's not in the present

She seems to be in the future

Mm

Right

Well if it 's why the future

Because that 's what that card

This is really your present circumstances

Because here you 're being crossed by a an untrustworthy woman perhaps 

Oh right

Here and now

I 'm not aware of it but I will keep my you know somebody may be doing the dirty on me  behind my back

Keep your eyes open

Yes

Right

Right

Next one

So you turn up the next card and you put it there I think

If I remember

Facing you

Yes

Oh I quite like this

They 're a big one but they want to put it at the top

OK above as it were

Two of cups

Gosh

What have we got here

An eagle

There 's a are  are they trying to exchange

One is reaching out for the other cup

One either giving or receiving or exchanging

At the top of

Yes

It represents what you want to make your own but is not your own at present

It 's also got this

Are those those uhm a little look like the double snake of the medicine sign

Yes

Yes

It is  I think

It 's also the sign of Hermes isn't it the messenger uhm who uhm is a guide to the occult world 

It looks a very good sign

Ah

Yes

It could be  the idea of change and new directions 

Mm

Looks very balanced to me

A youth and a maiden

Caduceus and Hermes and a lion 's head

Love

Ooh

About time too

Yes

Oh do you think something 

How long in the future

How long have I got to wait 

Or friendship 

Oh well

That 'll do

 or sympathy and the interrelation of the sexes

Mm

Is that your long-term plan

Oh well

It 's certainly my long term hope that I will have some kind of companion who would  with with you know with a reasonable mutual exchange and support and all the rest of it



That sounds good

Mm

Yes

Right

The next one 's the present 

Six stars

Scales of justice

Uhm uhm

I think it 's money

Oh is it

Laying out money

Oh yes

And handing it out

Alms

Maund uh maundy money 

Is he feeding the beggars or something

Or is he

Yes

He 's giving it out isn't he

Pentacles 

Presents gifts gratification

Press kits

Presents gifts gratification

Another is attention or vigilance

Present prosperity

Present prosperity

Mmm

Well present prosperity is uhm  not brilliant

I 'm not in the bl I 'm not in the red but I 'm uhm

Well perhaps you 're giving too much to other people

Giving too much away

Mm 

I I certainly am in terms of time and attention

I sh I don't know about money though 

Mm 

Hm 

Well this one here should be  this should be someone whose influence has been very strong in the past 

Four wands

Mm

Again that 's a good a very good positive card

There 's flowers and cheerfulness and garlands and all sorts of things

I like the idea of the castle

Mm 

Country life repose concord harmony prosperity peace 

And even if it 's upside down the meaning remains the same

That 's a good card

Well 

D' you think it 's an an ideal fantasy 

Doesn't say so

No

It says it 's a reality 

Well it 's also interesting because that 's what I 'm after 

Well it seems to be something you 've had  there

Mm

Or some person 

Mm

Don't recognise it 

And right there 's something the next one is about some current that 's coming into action

The future

Queen of Pentacles 

Ah that 's the Great Mother or one of the forms of the Great Mother 

There 's a  an atmosphere of uhm consolidation and uhm 

Yes

Agreed

Confirmation in this hand isn't there

Mm

So far

I remember last time there were a couple of sort of slightly anxious ones 

Uh the the woman the weeping woman in a boat being and ghastly things like that which I remember

Mm 

What else is she apart from mother

I mean is it like

Oh yes

That one

She 's material plenty

Again

Ah

Well maybe I 'm going to win the football pools this weekend

I have actually done them for a change 

Opulence generosity magnificence security liberty

Oh well

They 'll do

All of them  please

Mm

Right that 's coming in to your way in the future

Oh great 

I wonder if it 's going to have to come through  work or whether it 's going to be  a reclamation of 

No no

OK

Football pools will come

There 's been no sign 

A reclamation of that

That 's an interesting idea

Mm

Yes

All right

One one goes down here now

D does this top half of the deck uhm disappear altogether

Yes 

We 're only interested in that

Right

Yes

That next to it or

Oh the tower that looks a bit

Oh dear

Oh

Ooh that 's a n that 's an interesting one 

It 's uhm

Is it

it looks more energetic than the rest of them

It 's uhm it 's your opinion of yourself that one isn't it

Oh

Needs improving

There 's a crown being toppled off the top

I don't like that

I want it back on

Oh unless it 's sh shedding worthless bits

There 's some kind of couple of characters here  being chucked out

Oh yes it 's a dipping a rebirth

It 's a re it 's a rebirth sign

Exactly

Oh wonderful

Uhm  yes

Basically the  what are they talking about this

But I don't agree to this 

You don't 

Yeah

Course I do

That 's good

Can I say acey-pacey 

If you so desire

Uhm  yes

Uhm wh wh wh what were we going to do

Sorry

I was I was  again

Mmm 

Pardon

Uhm

I 'm completely lost now

Uh  yes

If it 's a delete  insert amendment right  that Alistair doesn't accept he can't move straight to vote until we 've debated the amendment

can he

Right

Then

Then

Oh no no no no no

No not at all

Well if it 's any sort of amendment at all and the proposer doesn't accept it then it can't go straight to the vote until uhm the amendment has been li discussed because there won't have been a speech against the motion  by by b by by by the very nature of the fact you cannot move it until there 's been a speech  against it

Uhm then again I don't think there 's going to be an amendment anyway  because I mean there 's  two and three-quarter hours of word meeting by word

Yeah

No

Right uh

Mhm

Do you think anyone will call quorum

I don't honestly know

I mean I know I 'm not and Neil Taylor isn't going to be

John Brown isn't going to be there uhm  so maybe one of his Tories will call quorum

Therese Coffey agrees with the motion the Chair for the Conservatives  so

Is she the chairman of the Conservatives now

Yeah

Therese Coffey

Yeah

And so I don't know

Are you sure no-one 's going to hear this tape except us

Well no

This person over in the Survey of English Usage is subscribe transcribing it

Oh right

But only But the names are changed and things like that so then they won't know

Has

Yeah

Because Therese Coffey 's a bit one-or-two-words-whispered

I don't know if I ought to say this

Pardon

Nothing nothing 

Uhm  yes

I didn't realise she was Chairman of the Conservatives

Gosh

She was since well since December onwards since the A G M onwards

Mm

Was she

Ah

You didn't realise

No

But I put two and two together 

Well you a you probably realised last night

Uhm the young lady sitting next to you uhm Marianne Burr was wearing the T-shirt you see

and e e e everybody

The T-shirt

I 'm glad you 've started wearing the T-shirts cos then you can pick them out  cos before I didn't realise

I didn't realise Marianne Burr was

Everybody came out of the woodwork last night uh

Mm

Cameing Coming out I think was definite

Yes

So I 'm so I 'm wearing my pink T-shirt and coming out too

Yeah

It 's uhm  It 's a worrying amount actually of people round Christian round the council table in the Christian Union

I thought oh God

You 're almost a majority in fact

Very sad isn't it

Mm

I 'm afraid they don't always vote the way you want them to though cos I was noticing this

When they were voting about your uhm  your your report about how you should have the meetings removed at the beginning

Several members of the Christian Union voted for Marianne 's proposal

Oh yes

Did they indeed

Mhm

Oh dear

They were up there

Oh

And I thought like hold on you 're wearing the T-shirt

You 're not supposed to vote like that

So you do what Nina and I say

No

Mm

Yes uhm

Who 's head of Christian Union

Uh David Vincent

Oh no

Geography second year

He 's also a member of the Union council

What a worrying man he is

He 's got these really wild staring eyes as if he 's possessed by something

Well it 's quite quite commonplace for C U people I think isn't it

I mean this one way of delin delineating 

Mm

Are you going grey

I don't think so 

Poss I possibly am actually you know with this work

Yes 

Yeah

I think you might be

I thought this the other day

Great

So uhm as I was saying  there might be an amendment

There might not be an amendment uhm but s seven minutes for seven minutes against

Uhm  if you can could you call me as opposing speaker please unless you see somebody else jumping up and down and uh

I 'm only asking you as a favour and

Mm

Yeah

Aled

Aled I 'll say whoever puts their hand up first

And don't stick your hands under my nose like you usually do

Well I shan't be sitting next to you so I can't can I

All right I 'm going

You didn't sit next to me in Union council

What did I do wrong

Nothing

Nothing

Had I been hassling you so much you couldn't bear it

I had to sit next to Theresa Coffey 

No

Nothing

Oh dear

Shame

No no no no no

It wasn't anything uhm It was nothing personal about it or anything

It 's just uhm I felt that if I stick if I kept sitting next to you I 'd keep on sticking my hand up under your face all the time which is most impolite

so uhm I thought I 'd just withdraw slightly sort of 

So I 'm sitting in front of you but not exactly on top of you 

Wise you see 

Who 's going to start the meeting today 

What do you mean

Who 's going to decide when the U G M starts today

Well it 's going to start at ten past one isn't it uh 

No cos I 'll be there at one

Are you going there at one today

Oh right

Well it 'll be you deciding when the meeting starts but I 'd highly recommend that it starts at about ooh ten past one

Mm

Why

Is that when it 's the wrong thing

No

I let them have ten minutes to get there at Union Council yesterday and you shouted at me 

You 're not very consistent here

Well you know councils are different because it was quorate  at three minutes past five

U G Ms are never quorate

No

But council was quorate at three minutes past five

Yeah

But that 's not the point

I mean four of the five sabbaticals were missing

That 's irrelevant

It isn't irrelevant

They have no other status in cou in council

I know they don't but it seems pointless to have it without them 

Well

Just the same as it was pointless to have it without uhm I don't know the the President of the Medics uhm

It 's like  starting U G Ms before I get there

No

We haven't done that

Well I did it once though only once

Mm

But you have haven't you

Yes

Mm

Yes

Well when you were very very late uhm

Mm

Yeah

About twelve minutes past

Oh it 's him

Let him in

Who is it

Taylor

Uh can I pick the boxes up please

Hello

 Neil

Yes uhm 

Thank you

How are you both

Fine

I 'm very fine

Good

I did think that the meeting last night was slightly excessive

I mean mean uhm

Did you 

Does Does shouting a lot and making lots of noise really have much effect uh in terms of intercession

or

Well  I think it does actually

Yeah

I think I think equally you can do it quietly

I

You do

Gives you a sense of community and a sense of spirit doesn't it

What noise

Mm

If you make lots of noise it means you 've gives you a sense of  positive stuff

Eh

Well

Have you got a black pen

Uhm

Not really

No

What 's this

There 's one

I think it is

Yes

Sounded like a sense of the ecstatic to me rather than a sense of of uhm

Yeah but isn't it surely you should be ecstatic about  Jesus

Holy 

If you 're going to do it you might as well go for it 

God

Mm

Him as well

Mm

You 'd make a good Christian you know 

Yes

Are you coming tonight to the meeting

No

I 'm not coming tonight to the thing

I 'm going to the all night sit-in

Remember

But can't you go to the sit-in later

No

Yes

You can actually

I don't want to come to a Christian Union meeting tonight

Oh you don't want to come to this

I 'm perfectly happy for you to clap and sing and be as loud as you want and if it makes you feel good then I 'm really happy

But I don't want to join in

We 're not going to clap and sing tonight

No no

There 's none of that

Th There 's not not clapping and singing tonight

There 's th Thank the Lord there is going to be no clapping and singing tonight

There 's going to be one or two solo performances and then we 're going to have a guest speaker saying why you should become a Christian

Oh

Right 

Aled why are you against the clapping and singing

See

Aled 's not against the clapping and singing

Yes clapping and singing he 's against it three hours non-stop 

Yes 

Yes

Because when I left the meeting last night they were half an hour before they finished and I had a headache

and 

Oo

It doesn't matter

No

I know

It does you good

It most probably does

We did some good praying

We We bound some evil spirits last night

It was really good

You did

Yeah

Yes

And once was enough

I thought Alistair was in the bar

Who

I 'm being sarcastic

She 's She 's being nasty

Yes

She 's being nasty

But you just told me he was talking out of his backside

That 's worse

Why should it only be last night

Come on

When he was saying that the constitution was only advisory

Well it is only advisory

The students have have said this is how they want it run

They have voted  that this is how they want it

Mm

It 's advisory

Well it is advisory

No one else has read it so it has to be advisory doesn't it

You consult it when you feel like it

Do they 

So people are ignoring what the students want then

Well yeah

By and large

I If if you must put it like that

But we are students so we 've got a right to say ourselves you see

I mean we 're just expressing our right  in the absence of eight thousand others

No



Yes

But but

No

No

Just because students in previous years have wanted that doesn't mean that we can't interpret it the way we want to

No

The majority opinion of a genuine meeting which is how we are all bound has said that they want it done this way

and if the students

How long ago

Uhm about  uhm seven months ago

Right

Far too long

It wasn't at a representative meeting 

They all are Neil

They 're all representative Neil

Well it didn't reach the quorum level

Yes it did Neil

The standing orders say that there 's a qu it was quorated unless deemed to be otherwise

So it was quorate

There were two hundred and fifty people at least in those meetings

No

That 's not true

That 's rubbish Aled

Bye

Bye Bye

Well do shut the door

He 's coming back

Yeah I know

But  sound travels

Uhm yes

And uhm well anyway is there anything else that you would like to know

or have I sh sort of pontificated

I still don't know why you don't like happy clappy songs

Maybe they give you a sense of belonging to the sh Spirit

Well no no

I I do I do I do like happy clappy songs but I don't like them for three hours non-stop

That 's all

Surely it 's an expurgation or whatever it is of expurging of  the day 's ills

My spiritual e

Filling you with the golden light of Jesus and things like that

Yes yes

I know but I have other means of uhm of spiritual expression other than those

Uh I 'm not that kind of Christian I 'm afraid

Why wasn't Kate at the thing last night

She 's a very dodgy Christian

I have to say this

Possibly

Yes

Very dodgy

John came back with us last night talking of dodgy Christians

Yes

But who are we to judge

Not me

No exactly

Was uhm John appearing distinctly sort of uneasy when uhm Kate was uhm all round him

Yes  yes

He 's desperately desperately in love

I wouldn't worry

Mm

No no uh 

Wu w w one obviously doesn't wish to make young gentlemen feel uncomfortable and all that uh uhm

Mm

It 's his problem

Well possibly yes

Possibly

Course it is

Yeah

What was I going to say

Oh yes

Mark England 's lovely question to me last night talking of people uhm speaking of  uhm asking me

shouldn't the E and R officer have a campaigning role and join in with N U S campaigns

And then I looked up in the standing orders and there 's nothing about my doing campaigns whatsoever

No

But you could

I could yes

But he was saying it as if it was my job to do it whereas of course it isn't

And I showed him the standing orders afterwards and saying

here Mark where

and he 's been chair of the N S O committee

and he should know what the standing orders and what 's in them

No no no no no

This is a false belief you 've been having for a good few years now and I think it 's time  that you got rid of this

Just because you 're chair of the N S O committee doesn't necessarily mean you know what it says in the standing orders

It means you know where to find them  and you know what they are

Right 

But but you don't actually know exactly what it says

I have hordes of wonderful men around me who tell me what to do all the time

I don't need to read them

What few wonderful men

Me and Luke 

And Mark

And Mark

And Alan

Alan 's read them

Oh right

Alan 's so lovely isn't he

I wouldn't actually say any of the four are wonderful but never mind

Uh

Alan 's really sweet

Yes but

You 're all wonderful in your own way 

Except Luke 

Yeah 

Oh don't be nasty

You play this back and I 'll kill you 

No no no

How can you do a survey of English language uses when I 'm eating Twiglets

Well I suppose there must be some sort of uhm

Is there is a sort of can you transcribe scrunch scrunch scrunch

I don't know

I mean uh I dare say the people who 're on the other end of the tape will have a go at doing it uh

So what I mean what is it

What 's it for

No idea

I have no idea

It 's uhm  it 's they they 're building up a corpus of uhm conversations in English so that they can uhm

I dunno don't know

I have no idea

Uhm a study of the grammar and structures of English so

My grammar is really dodgy though 

I get the words in the wrong places 

I heard you speaking Welsh yesterday

It was really nice

Oh dear

Oh right

I was listening and fascinated

You were listening

Were you understanding it

No not a word of course

No

But I was still listening

Right

Oh

That 's my mo well it 's not my mother tongue

I 'm bi bilingual so I suppose

I thought it was your mother tongue

Well  it 's it 's debatable whether one can say that if one is raised in a bilingual community that either language is one 's mother tongue

But does your do your parents speak in Welsh

Yes

Well then it 's your mother tongue then isn't it because your mother speaks it

Well she also speaks English

No but at home what do they speak

Welsh

Right 

Right

They all speak Welsh

Yes

How do they speak in Northampton

Northampton

Not Northampton

North uh Nottingham



What do they speak

Yes

They say things like acey-pacey

Acey-pacey

Right

So funny

I haven't heard that phrase for a long time

Uhm 

Right

Sorry

Anyway I 'm just some of the uhm Labour posters uhm they talk about British Telecom 's monopoly



Sorry

Thank you

Talking about British Telecom 's monopoly 

And uh isn't that sort of like factually incorrect and should it be allowed on a poster 

Yes

Uhm 

Well 

That 's interesting really isn't it

It 's an opinion I suppose a point of view

I mean they do have a monopoly where I live for example 

Uh  there 's no choice

Uhm but it 's not strictly speaking true is it

There are other telecommunications companies in this country

Right

Yeah

The large one being Mercury

what could be done about it

That 's interesting

Cos they 're all stamped union-approved so I thought

What does it say

Uh sh shall I go and get one

I mean there are hundreds

Yes

I 'll be back in a minute

You can have one 

Thank you

And there 's more than one on the notice board 

I see

It 's a bit tedious really isn't it

Uhm a terribly boring poster

but never mind  uhm

Mm

The  one was pretty 

Well I mean you could just cross out apostrophe S monopoly and just say British Telecom makes one hundred pounds ' profit each second which is  not untrue

This adjective here is a matter of opinion

Uhm

I agree

It 's just the monopoly business that I thought

Well it 's a duopoly in this country isn't it really

Uhm in Brit Brit British Telecom 's share of the of the duopoly makes one hundred pounds ' profit each second

Uhm

It 's 

Yeah

I was just wondering if it was worth complaining to whoever was in charge or not bothering

I  don't think so 

Honest it 's hardly worth you the breath I shouldn't have thought somehow

You you you you 've seen the uhm the Labour posters that are going round at the moment uhm on the on the billboards

Probably

It 's about time with the Tories or something isn't it

Various well yes various things

Uh  yes

So I I as I say I mean let 's just j just take it at face value

No-one 's going to make any fuss about it basically

It 's just  everybody ignores them anyway

Uh Labour Club have no force in this college so  doesn't really matter

Thank God

Are you going to be at the U G M today

I am indeed

That should be fun

Are you going to this sleep-in or not

Well I brought a sleeping bag with me

Well I brought a blanket

Uhm I don't have a sleeping bag unfortunately

Oh right

No

I got my sleeping bag uhm so in case I need to be there for some reason

Then I can I thought I 'd have my sleeping bag in the office and go over every couple of hours

Check everything 's OK nobody 's causing a riot you know

Uhm

Yeah

What what are they actually are people going to actually be able to work

Are they actually going to be able to use books in there

Yes

It 's it 's only going to be the Donaldson part of the library open probably

Which is that

Is that the

That 's the uhm  that 's the economics philosophy linguistics history of art fine art

That sort of area

Economics one



Yeah

So you can look at lots of books on economics you see if you want to

Oh I mean I was going to do my economics tonight anyway

Thought I would 

What time 's the actual library shut because I want to get a book out overnight

Ah right

Quarter to nine

Quarter to nine

Right

Is is the time the issue desk shuts

Yeah

OK

Well I have to get over there for then

Yes right

Well I I doubt we 'll be able to borrow books after quarter to nine uhm

Uhm even though we 'll be there I suppose

Uhm no

I doubt if it 's a problem

if it gets through or not you know sort of I 'll make a speech against it you know

but cos it 's cos it 's not going to affect us

I mean it 's it 's everybody in college is on our side

So

Right

But the provost you mean 

But the provost 's hands are tied by the government basically so 

It 's a sad argument but  uhm

Ah well 

Never mind

Anyway who speaks in your next the next E and R

I don't know

How many people are hacking for your position

Well there are five who 've got forms with me so far

Really

For E and R

Mm

Yes 

Hattie Tinge

Hattie Tony  Nicole

Ah I thought Nicole was going to do P and C

No

That 's Ken

Mhm

Yeah

No

Then I 'm not sure  there 's a couple of others so it should be fun

Yeah

I think I  I possibly think Tony won't bother

Yeah

Because he didn't realise Ross was backing

Well he thought Ross was backing Hattie 

Right

Uhm so I think he may not have the confidence to go ahead as it were

Oh I think he should

I mean I think he should stand anyway

Yeah

You know

I mean there 's uh you don't lose anything by standing do you

Well he 's got his fir first poster done and stuff like that 

But uhm  I haven't seen him

He 's been away this week which is a bit stupid

Yeah

Well well I mean he 's away this week I think

Reading week

But uhm Ross is also very elusive at the moment so uhm 

Mm

Yes

Yeah

How about the other positions

Have they been carved up or

No

Well I mean it 's up to the electorate isn't it uhm  who gets the posts

Well

Yeah

I suppose so

Well I dunno don't know

I dunno don't know

S and S is hotting up isn't it

Well he 's got three so far

Uh is it Heather Hedge Haddycollet that 's hotting up really

Mr Taylor

Well I 'm sure it adds spice to the issue

He 's hardly the most uhm sort of  uh charismatic character who uhm

No

But he 's famous isn't he

He 's famous yes yes but his fame has worked against him occasionally mm and so uh

Yeah

I dunno don't know



How 's the mission going

OK

OK OK OK

Big meeting tonight seven-thirty in the Bloomsbury

Come along

Bring your friends

I 'm actually going to the Chemistry dinner

Ah right

So I 'm afraid I 'll have to decline

Right

OK

I go to my own religious meetings anyway

Which religious meetings are these

Well I mean I 'm a Catholic so I go to church on Sundays

Oh yeah but this is the Christian Union

This is this this is the united uh front of college Christians rather than just one denomination

We 'd go around

I suppose so but I 'm not very ecumenical I must admit

Oh dear

The Pope and nothing else

It 's awful isn't it

Well it 's not exactly the Pope but uh I know what you mean yes

Well it 's uh  yes

Yeah

OK

Anyway I 've got to go because I 've got a lecture so

What fun

What are you doing

I 'm looking at your papers

Oh yeah

So oh good

I 'm glad that you 're going to admit that anyway

Well I think they 're interesting subjects

I 've seen them all before

I daresay you have John

Now where can they be in this 

I 'm afraid I 'm not uhm  I 'm not the most  environmentally conscious in  in my disposal of paper

Oh yeah

I 've got a big bag of uh recyclal recyclable sort of three-or-four-words some time

Well get them to 

Emma

To Kathy Klein

Oh

Can't I just dump them in here and leave them for her

No

You cannot dump them in here 

It 's not the way that it 's done

Now try

and three-or-four-words 

What 's that

My con my contract 

Discussion tomorrow

Well it 's not a discussion

It 's for information

Oh 

Well no

Well no what

Hold on 

So what else is on the agenda tomorrow morning

Not a lot Jimmy

Just uhm  the declaration of nominations meeting for the year

Oh yeah

Can I see the nomination forms please

Well there 's 

How many

Well two saxophones

No  trumpet and bass players 

Can I have two sets please 

Mm 

Have you any ideas 

I 'll take them to committee tonight

Sarah won't want to do it 

Joe won't 

David might 

Matt won't 

Fiona may well do  if I can uh  persuade her 

What 's up with Lee at the moment then

I dunno don't know 

I think uh people are tired 

Do they have to sign on the back

No

See they 're three-or-four-words by twelve thirty tomorrow morning

What happens if they commend declaration

Can they appoint me as their agent

They can't appoint you as their agent because you haven't been on the committee

So

That doesn't actually say I can't

That means you can't be impartial

Are you voting

I haven't been impartial Aled

And if you are somebody 's agent you have to be impartial 

I 've never heard that one before

Have you not 

Uhm the N S O Committee

That 's not much use

How old 's that

Twenty-eighth of January  

Oh are you going to print an agenda to let Tina circulate

Tomorrow morning 

Well I 'm having Gay put out uhm a reminder slip at the moment which should be in your pigeon-hole before ten-thirty  just so I can cover myself and with twenty-four hour notice

Uhm  now where was that stupid bit

Yeah

D' you want me to find it for you

Well you won't find it name

You 'll just look at other things

What 's this





That 's my message to Peter

He 's in the U G M 

I told them the quickest way to sort it out would be to go in and sit there and call quorum 

but neither of them had the bottle 

Why have I got this  this paper I mean  

Mm

These are old papers down here

Old Mother Gladstone 's 

In  

Are you planning it

Oh that 's  and a half

That 's nice

I told you 

 

Eighth of November that 's E R

And anything else attached to it

Ninth of December 

Mm

No

It wouldn't be that  

No

You 're right

What 's this

Contract with sabbatical officers and students 

Another copy of the  at the last elections 

What 's this 

Here we are

Oh that 's where it is

Oh thank you Neil

Oh that 's quite extraordinary

Oh

I don't know why I go to so much trouble 

Oh good 

Ah

Are they typed on a 

Uhm

No they 're not

Does it look like it

Simon typed them himself

Yes probably

Yeah

Oh good then so I mean I can I can circulate those huh 

It 's uhm quite useful really

Uhm

Yes

Oh those are the uhm those are Alastair Black 's if you 're interested

I 'm going to append these to the next council report 

Probably yeah

I dunno don't know

 sabs

Nobody knew what the sabs should be doing

That 's quite interesting

Well everybody thinks they know what the sabs should be doing

And everybody thought that they did when they came in

And  whether they do now or not is another thing

That 's what what the question was asking 

Public speaking skills 

Isn't that a strange one to put down there 

Why 

Doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of them on the list 

Anyway I 'd better go

Had you

I 've got to buy some plants today

Oh lovely 

Mm 

Right

Oh plants

Are they uhm the best 

 

Yeah

Mm

Do you keep at least do you keep a list of the sabs three-or-four-words at the sub elections 

Of course

You didn't you wouldn't happen to leave it lying around on the table by any chance would you

It 's lying around somewhere else at the moment

Is it



Is it 

Behind my desk 

Oh 

That 's what she 's going for 

Societies Secretary 

Well I  

Who 's Ed Dickinson 

Uhm  oh dear 

Oh it 's Tim Stokes going for Social and Services not Tim Cole 

Who forms the the axis of the social committee

Guy or gal

 

Mm 

Now on my uh my manifesto do I put down Classics or Greek and Latin or what cos when I 'm when I 'm listing my seconders 

Uh depending on whether you want course or department listed

Suppose a mixture of both 

Well then you could put 

Perry Davis Classics two or uhm Mike Jones Greek and Latin two 

Am I allowed to do that

Well it 's up to you

Well would it be ruled out of order

On what grounds

Oh dunno don't know

I 'm asking you 

I 'd like to see your grounds for moving out of order 

And on manifesto I 'm only allowed to mention  names that aren't proposers and seconds

Yeah

Yes

Nobody else

Not even the Provost

No

I 'm not allowed to mention the Provost is  continuing the rooms available 

I don't know

I can't remember

Uhm  where 's my 

Ah well how does it 

We desperately need a Christian to go for the A W don't we

Yes 

Ah ha 

Where is it

Where is it

Where is it 

Section D of the standing orders 

These boxes in here

Is Tanya going to go for E and R

You made her bottle out didn't you

I don't think she is but I mean

 and that means that she 'll bottle out

I dunno don't know do I

I haven't seen him all last week

He 's  finding the time to get people to sign his forms isn't he

What he needs is three-or-four-words

It is knocking on a bit then

Getting getting sorted in about three days ' time

Well

It can be done but 

Does he how many of the E and R people now are how many people 's going for E and R

God knows

Do you know whether Sarah Norman 's going 

Six boxes three-or-four-words



So unless they 're on  proposer or seconder of you you can't mention 

Can't mention 

Can't what about the Provost

I can't say the Provost wants to allocate a number of rooms in my manifesto

Unless he proposed or seconded you I don't think you can

Well does that mean that other manifestos can be ruled out of order on that ground 

Should be

That means they could be but you wouldn't bother

I don't know

I I I would have to wait for the  for the events to arise wouldn't I 

And I 'd use my discretion if necessary at that time

Depends on who 's done it

Well 

Indeed 

And what 's that big thing

It 's the uhm duty roster for uh  the ballot box

Oh can I put can I put Louise in that one please

Not yet

Wait until after uhm tomorrow night

Why

Because uhm I can't accept names until uhm until I know who 's standing who 's seconding whom

and uh

Not even in pencil

Not even in pencil because Miss Kate MacPherson would bash me on the head with a three-or-four-words because she 's having first priority

Yeah

But she won't want to be voted away will she

I don't think she will 

No

We need to pray for me

I feel sick 

I think I 've got bellyache after after Wonkie 's announcement 

Oh dear 

What 's the nature of the sickness

Don't know

Well it 's serious

I think I 'm going to have some diarrhoea but I haven't found the food checks yet

I have to go 

Is there any way you can shut the Bloomsbury ballot box on Wednesday

On what grounds

Well it 's been very crowded there

It 's not usually

We don't want don't want to  any stampede at the box do we 

Safety measures and all that

You mean that all those Christian Union people pouring out of their prayer meeting will be going immediately to the Bloomsbury ballot box and causing a stampede

I don't think so somehow

No

I was thinking more in terms of all the sporties causing a stampede

I mean would we would well we don't want them to be injured just before they start the match do we

I don't suppose we would  no

No

So it might be wise to shut the ballot box at lunch time

Uhm the N S O Committee have decided  that there should be an open ballot box at that time

And it is not for me to uhm to deign to  think myself  possible to uhm  to wish to question the decision of the N S O committee

Sure

I being a mere functionary and a servant

Well the thing is you 've got staff shortages at the time and you can't possibly put somebody on the ballot box

If there were staff shortages then possibly yes

but uh

Can I create staff shortages please as well as snow 

Do as thou wills thou wilt please 

The Lord desires  de desires from afar 

Well it 's not exactly honest desires as far as I can see

Mm

Anyway I must go I think

Mm

Both Monday and Tuesday are the tenth are the tenth of February  according to What 's On

Mm

Both both Monday and Tuesday are the tenth of February this year according to What 's On 

According to What 's On

I guess it means  something very strange

If I can place five adverts in one day and get a bill for three quid and five adverts in another day and get a bill for four pounds and seventy it 's beyond me 

But I must go anyway

Bye bye

Mm

See you later on

Yeah

You 're making a lovely mess out of that 

Hmhm 

Nice though 

Actually Mark  I 'm pleasantly surprised

it 's OK 

I was a bit anxious when you said chilli  but 

Yeah three-words-mumbled

Mhm

Mmm

It 's lovely 



 

Help yourself

Well  better than Justin

He just picks at mine 

Well Ruth when she 's got a cold blows her nose and leaves the hankies all over the place 

No you don't

What you do

you get a cold and you blow your nose

and you sort of throw it at the bin and it misses you know

And then when you blow your be nose

and then you put it down by your side cos you 've only half used it 

And you know 

Yeah yeah yeah

That 's right yeah

Yeah

All over

Get value for money out of Kleenex

Yeah

Yeah

 they 're expensive 

And then you go get up and you go into the other rooms so you leave them there

The they 're all scrunched up and

Yeah I do actually when I 've got a cold

The whole house is covered in tissues 

Oh dear 

But I don't often have a cold so quite lucky 

Mhm 

Are you are you living in Camden now

Uhm uhm 

Is that OK

Mark was telling me 

Sorry

Mark was telling me  you know

Is it OK

Yeah

It 's just some  council flat

But it 's just a little small block sort of six flats in it

You know where the Palace is

There 's a road going up the side 

Bottom of the High Street 's Camden Palace  and it 's kind of on a corner 

If you go up that road it 's just at the bottom of that

So it 's pretty central

It 's quite good 

Mm

Yeah

Mm

Yeah

Oh right

I mean we went we went to a party once just behind the Camden Palace

Do you remember

Yeah

That was 

Oh

Oh they 're nice

Thanks 

Uhm  that 's that 's on the same road as that Steve lives then isn't it

What what Steve 

Somewhere along there isn't he

Oh

Ah the one Sarah 's going out with

Yeah

He lives along that 

Yeah

He used to live in the flat opposite

Oh



Oh right s s so he 

Oh opposite

Oh I see

Yeah

And I lived in the same flat a couple of years ago

and I sort of got    

Oh right

Where was that in 

Mm right

So is it is it uhm  a hou housing association then or is it council 

Uhm well it 's a council flat 

But my friend got it  I think about twelve years ago

But it 's three bedrooms and he 's just  a single man

 about half an hour

Mm

But they were giving them away like really easily then

How long 's he been there

Twelve years

Yeah



But he just sublets sort of the bedrooms

He lives in this huge living room

That 's that 's the place which he lives in

Like it 's his own bed-sit and he rents out three bedrooms 

It 's it 's shared but

Oh right

Is that sort of official or

No

Well no

I don't know how it works 

But a lot of people do that sort of thing you know

I 'm sure

Well we 're not supposed to have  we 're not supposed to have Becky at our place

To survive

No

Why

Because we 've got a mortgage and uhm

You pay different rates when you 've got when you rent properties

Yeah

That 's right

Well you well you pay more

Mm

Yeah

Well you 've got income coming in from the property I suppose haven't you 

Mm 

But I mean she only what pays about te tw twenty quid a week or something doesn't she

Yeah

Twenty quid

Yeah but uh

Oh Jesus

Your hands 

Was that really hot

She put 

It 's quite comfortable

Sort of left it there in the air you know

Well I was putting it down

Well I was waiting for Ruth to

Balanced it on the wine bottles

I was waiting for

Waiting for me to do what

To move your hand and then I could have put it down

Just waiting for the pixies to come and sort of

Can you pass the s the sour cream please

For someone daft enough to pick it up really 

So what 's 

Ruth said something about Sarah and Steve having a pagan wedding

Oh yeah 

Oh Mark stop it

She just told me in the car

I thought you I thought I thought you knew about it

No

I didn't 

I forgot to tell Justin

We all forgot to say anything you know and he wouldn't

Well from what I gather bla both of them are making it 

What 

A big thing of it

Yeah

A big thing of it mmm

From from months ago

Yeah

Really

Well I haven't seen them in ages 

The only time I saw them was at the Camden Palace and 

Yeah

Well  we should be invited to the reception 

There 's a reception

Well I don't know

Just some sort of

What Epping Forest in a clearing 

How how long 's Sarah been pagan 

Yeah

Well  couple of years I suppose

Really 

But not really sort of actively 

I think it de I think it depends really on how far you want to take it doesn't it

Mm

Yeah absolutely

Uhm

So do you have to get wedding presents 

Bloody hope not

If I do I 'm out of the country for  while she 's getting married

Mhm

So so is it

But it 's an official thing the wedding or or they 're just doing 

I mean is it

Well

Like are parents involved and things

From what I can gather it 's a small like

No

God 

See I think I think if her dad if uh if her dad knew he 'd like probably 

She hasn't talked to them

Freak

Yeah 

 or something

Well it 's not exactly uhm

Pass the sour cream please

Yes

Well  he 's always worried about Sarah getting too serious with her boyfriends

Mhm

Yeah

Sure

So uhm  if anything to do with marriage whether it 's sort of pagan or anything like came into it I 'm sure he 'd like  he wouldn't be too happy

That sounds like my mum

It 's not as if it 's legally binding or anything

That 's just it

I mean 

OK it 's all  it 's all very nice and all very romantic and like  you know this and that and

Well it 's not going to do any harm is it

No

It 's not going to do any harm to anyone

No

Yeah 

But then again why should marriage b if you look at it marriage shouldn't really do any harm anyway

It should only do good

But well you see it 's not

Well the idea behind it anyway

Mm 

I don't know

It just seems to me that they 're

Well I know S Steve was well serious on it 

Like  she is l she

He 's quite young as well isn't he 

His early twenties

About twenty-three

twenty-three

I mean she 's like the woman the woman for him to like be with for the rest of his life sort of thing from what I can gather 

But knowing Sarah I can't quite imagine the same from her 

Yeah

Excuse me

Mm 

Well it 's interesting

I mean she  she seems to be quite sort of

She said oh well you know if it doesn't work out it doesn't work out sort of thing

I know but that 's like

That 's just like a cop out

I that 's what I mean

If this is like a cop out marriage 

Most pagans who get married yeah they have a pagan ceremony

but they 're doing the marriage not for fun not for a novelty value not just for their friends for entertainment

they 're doing it because they want to make a commitment 

And to reinforce that commitment while without without necessarily sharing the same beliefs on the whole as Christians

but they 'll do the pagan thing and then they 'll go out and get a registry office thing afterwards 

I mean most pagan marriages like I think ninety per cent that 's what happens

Yeah

Mm

Yeah I know

You can go down

It 's like with Sharl in House of the Goddess  that

She 'll tell you that

I mean she does uhm

Most of them are in London

 

Well that 's what I said to Sarah

look you realise this is a commitment

She says yeah yeah I know it 's a I realise it 's a commitment but 

But then you know if you te

Another thing

I mean if if you 're going to say

if it doesn't work it doesn't work

It 's all very well

but I mean if you haven't got enough commitment to even try and make it work when it starts going wrong there 's not much not much point in doing it is there

It 's not so much of a commitment if you take the registry side out

Oh God no

Yeah

That 's probably not what she meant you know

It 's a question of faith

Maybe not

Yeah

I don't know

I da I 've I 've no idea

I mean I just



I haven't seen much of Sarah recently anyway

I didn't say much when she said it

I said oh

Just congratulated her and  you know

When are they doing that

Mm

Mid-April sometime

April the ninth

Yeah 

Really

April the sixteenth

Well I hope it works

Wish them the best

Mm

I remain sceptical from my own personal experiences

Yeah yeah

I mean 

Just seems a little strange  sort of

It 's uh pretty quick

I know it 's what everyone  always says about it 

It is pretty quick 

Mm

Another taco 

Thanks  

I 'll have that one

Taco sandwich

No

I 'll have that one



Taco sandwich

Yeah yeah

You can get more in

Just more sides to ooze out of

that 's all 

Ah 

Uhm 

Mm

I 'm well impressed with this though

Mm 

It 's easy to make 

See I mean you shouldn't have seen all the preparation bits

I should have like just whipped up this amazing meal

and you 'd have gone God Mark

you must have spent hours slaving over the stove

And I would have said yeah you know

Mm

Taco bar  Leicester Square

When it really only took me fifteen minutes 

Taco what

Taco bar

It was like Tacos and Mexican food but it was like McDonald 's

It was sort of take-away tacos

It was just like McDonald 's except  Mex Mexican food like burritos and tacos and that sort of thing

Stuff like that

What 's that

Mm

Where 's that

Well it 's closed down now

It was sort of between Leicester Square and Piccadily Circus

Mm 

Well nice 

So that reminds me 

Simon 's  or Debbie 's birthday thing

Yeah

Is it the nineteenth or something

Yeah

Cos we were going to go and see Love Hate that day

but it 's sold out 

Mhm

We need to give the restaurant a ring 

See if they 'll provide some vegetarian food

I 'm sure they will if you say you know it 's a birthday party people are coming down from Sheffield whatever 

Mm

 

See I don't really know much about Mexican food

Well  I don't think that uhm  as a rule there 's that much meat but most places can accommodate for you

You know they don't mind you know

I do it 's not much of a fuss

Mm

No

You know they 'll just say

They must do vegetarian stuff

 everywhere 's doing vegetarian stuff

They 'd be stupid not to

There 's so many

Mm

Mm

Everyone does at least one dish don't they

Yeah

There 's so many veggies

Or you can uhm order like a meat and three veg without the meat

They should let you do that

Yeah

If the worst comes to the worst

Thank you  for giving up your time Paul

Well I don't see it as giving up the time 

Well for for giving me the time

Contributing

Contributing the time

Thank you very much anyway because there 's no money in it

If it furthers if it furthers  modern psychological  thinking  even one tiny little  snippet of what I say will be of value to  something else

Something like this



Uhm

Go on

Lovely

Thank you 

Anyway as I said I 'm doing research into  paternal deprivation different different different people 's experience of it 

Anyone who 's had an absent father is an expert in this field  mostly without being aware of it 

Of course like the others I 'll speak to you 're totally anonymous right

You 're reading this aren't you

Yeah

I 'm reading this bit 

When I write up the report  uhm everything you say that I write down or record uh with your permission  is utterly completely confidential 

Do you think it works with anyone with one  who talks

Right 

OK 

So you 're anonymous so you can say what you like

OK 

So 

It 's necessary it 's necessary to say that just to make you sure that you know 

So uh first of all briefly  I 'll just put a general question

I want to ask what you think about the role of the father today 

Thank you very much 

Mm

Role of the father today 

Very wide  

On the role of the father 

We 're not doing the father yet uhm 

I guess the role of the father is difficult  to type 

Uhm  central role 's being the breadwinner having the responsibility financial  uhm  classical role 

Uhm  myself as a father  a potential father

Uhm

Leave that

We 're coming back

Uhm  perhaps if you could tell me a little bit about your own father 

Gah aren't you being vague

I mean do you want some 

Uhm well uh if you could just remind me for example what age he was when what age you were when he left and

can't remember

I was uh I was uh I was six when he left  and uhm 

Don't remember much about him from those days

I mean I know him now as a uhm  I know him now as a man and what this has meant 

Uhm I 've got

My relationship with him when we were younger seems to be  uhm 

I was afraid of him  didn't really know him and I was kind of glad when  when he left 

Uhm  I think I was  probably possessive and jealous of my mother 

She was always the one that I felt really emotionally close to very very much so 

And uhm  and one senses that he was in the way of that

Mm

Right

You you 've anticipated my next question

But uhm  my next question was going to be that  were you aware of any fee of having any particular feelings about him when you were a child aged say less than eight

Yeah

Uhm I 've just told you 

Really ah 

Do you want any more

Mm

No no 

Uhm  can you describe to me if it 's possible uhm  a typical day in your home  when you were a boy of less than fourteen 

What do you remember

Mm

Well  I remember

I remember  sort of  there were  very hot  summers  uh for some reason 

I wanted to two-or-words pavement 

The flies that were on the pavement

A long stream of flies 

I used to just sit on the pavement uhm just treading on them 

Uhm  not being allowed to have guns when I was a kid uhm toy guns

I had a secret gun  

Keeping it in my drawer and  about it 

Uhm  typical day

I don't know 



Mm

Mm

OK

Don't let me let me make it a bit easier

I wonder if you could  uhm  look at these cards  and sort them into which you feel describe the state of your life as a child and which don't 

OK 

So we should end up with two piles of cards 

OK

Well

OK

 there

These are the dos and these are the don'ts

Right uhm 

Uhm is there anything that you noticed that is glaringly obviously missing 

From those cards

From the pile that you thought well if I think of my childhood as one particular  all I would say what springs to mind and you haven't been feeling it  or not 

No

No

OK 

Uhm  if you imagine that you 're aged ten and your mother is speaking about your father  what sort of things might she have said 

Well she 'd have been  resentful contemptuous  uhm 

She said that he was irresponsible  lazy  pathetic parasite  uhm  a drunkard

Right 

Uhm  what I 'm not able to imagine myself is  did you did you ever imagine how life would be if  you did have a father who lived at home 

When you were a child I mean 

Uhm 



No

I suppose I  kind of hoped my mother would get married again  uhm 

No

I hadn't really thought about the idea of having a father again although I 'm  I found that I uhm  definitely missed  a father figure  only more so when I was  uhm  going through adolescence I mean and all that kind of stuff 

Because I I I  I think I used to create  fathers out of authority figures maybe at school or uhm 

I don't know

I find it very difficult finding a  kind of role model  and so I used to lose friends and things like this 

Very very common failing

Uhm I didn't quite know what I was supposed to be into 

Mm 

Were you aware of being  different from the  the normal   finally

Careful 

No

No

Not really 

What do you consider the various effects of the role model on  on boys 

The effects of a role model on boys 

Well

You mean in general  kind of question

Uhm  well  a sense of values show you how to do things to uhm  help with giving you direction give you a kind of a  uhm support in some areas  uhm  instil a sense of responsibility teach you how to do   uhm  grown up things 

Yeah

But I don't want to need teaching to be grown up

Mm

And

You 're very astute Paul 

Very astute

Uhm

I 'm very astute but I 'm anticipating your questions

No no

No

It 's just that  you 're you 're very aware of people  anyway

Mm

Mm

What are the ways in which you think the  development of your sexual awareness as an adolescent was affected by not having a father there 

Well  my mother was very very uh uh extraordinarily uhm  liberal you know

She she was fine at getting me to bring girlfriends home and  

I could do what I like in that respect so there was no  restriction there uhm which was very un unusual  very uncommon

Uhm  not having a father around although my father probably wouldn't have thin

things would have probably been the same

Uhm  he he was around

I I remember I I got a girl pregnant when I was about seventeen and he was great

He really came to the rescue then 

Mm 

He he uhm sorted that out

Mm

But did you you did see him then for a while

Yeah

Oh yeah

From time to time 

How often was uh from time to time

Couple of times a year maybe even going for two years about seven times 

Not very often initially

Then we have 

I think he was out of London for quite some time 

I never really particularly wanted to see him 

Especially when I was younger he was boring 

Ah he used to look after me sometimes

I used to dread it 

He was just  very strict and very boring 

Mm

Mm

Mm 

Uhm  were your first  sexual relationships anything like you 'd expected them to be 

I guess not 

You know  

No  

No just one off

D' you want me to expand on that

or  you asked me 

What 

what were you expecting that they weren't like

Hang on

Uh 

Well I didn't know what to expect in that sense

but  I found it very traumatic and distressing 

especially my very first one 

I was very idealistic about  sex

I wanted it to be I wanted it to be perfect and I wanted to be in love and  could I couldn't

I found that I was not  behaving like my  well

all my friends were trying to have sex with  pretty  pretty much anybody they they  wanted to 

Uhm  I think I remember being with a girl  that I 'd met  uhm  who I was just impressing and she she wanted me to  go all the way when I was about sixteen and I just  could not just  couldn't

I mean you know like  out of the question 

Uhm  then I fell madly in love when I was about seventeen with this girl this seventeen or sixteen-year-old girl

I was just  potty totally  gone there 

And uh I won't go through the whole story

but I managed to end up  in bed with her one afternoon  just wanting her so  so much 

and uhm  I I just didn't know what to do

I didn't know how to get it get it from where it was into

It was just like

And I couldn't perform

I mean it was terrible trauma 

I mean I had so much desire to  everything 

And uhm  then she  she didn't want to continue the relationship not because of that necessarily

I mean it might have been I don't know  uhm very suddenly 

And I became  desperately hurt 

And for years I was doing all sorts of  to try  and win her back

Then I became obsessed with her  all the way into my  from about seventeen to sort of  nineteen or twenty 

It seemed like a lot longer  uhm

Mm

Really

Mm

Now you 've you 've anticipated my next question again because my next question was how do you think you viewed women at that time and how does that compare with your views today

Uh you you were saying that at that time you  viewed very women very  idealistically and 

Oh

How does that compare with how d' you how you see them today 

How do you 

Well  I forced myself to change my  what you say view of women  from being uh  very idealized to being well I was very bitter 

And uhm  I guess I made a decision that  I wasn't going to I wasn't going to be hurt again 

Now I treat women like  sex objects

I just get pleasure out of them 

I mean that 's not my  not my view now 

But uhm  I taught myself to have  to have sex 

I mean it was like I deliberately went out to practice having sex  with anybody

I thought that there was safety in numbers  

And uhm  this made it I 've had two broken marriages

it made it very difficult 

It still is very very very difficult for me to be monogamous  and to have a satisfying ongoing sexual relationship with anybody

I think it would  

Mm

Mm

How do you think your your mother 's life  was influenced by being a single parent

I mean do you think she would have been different if there 'd been  a supportive man in the home 

Oh yes 

No doubt about it 

I mean she had to bring me up on her own  you know on a secretary 's wages which was what we had

It 's the biggest library I 've ever seen

it has no books 

How does it compare in size to Martin 's hall

You 've seen Martin 's hall haven't you

Well it 's about the s

Yes

It 's comparable I would think but with a lower ceiling

 

Lower

Lower than Martin 's

Gosh

I think I mean his ceiling 's not not high

It 's a long a long narrow room

And uhm Jane might be interested

I mean if they 're civilized people who come to the dance hall   uhm she might be interested in hiring it out

Oh I think they 're pretty civilized people

How would she cater

 

I don't think she 'd do any catering

No

I mean Martin would ha have to do the catering

You see the thing is Martin built a built a sort of kitchen on the side 

You know  

 you 'd have to hire out the kitchen too



Well I should think that Jane could 

She has a huge range in her kitchen



That 's all she has

Thank you

Thank you

But I mean catering for the number of people 

But I 'll mention it to Martin

But wouldn't she have the same problems

There 's still the

She 's 

Well there 's  you 've got fire exit signs

Yes

But couldn't they be her guests and couldn't they be Martin Nichols ' guests

Well no they can't be

They 're paying money for this thing

Well couldn't they pay money into another fund 

I don't know

I think when you have a certain number of people uh uhm members of the public in certain in a place

Martin has no proper fire exits

The only exits he has one of which led into the loos 

The other one led i i into a sort of lean-to at the side 

And the thir And the third one which was a true exit you have to you ha ha have to have gone with a band to get to it

So I mean it was really hopeless

We

Everybody rushing out in a panic 

We have We have French windows in this room

There are lots of windows

It 's on the ground floor

So I I 'm not sure that it might not uhm fulfil the requirements

We had We had this

Wouldn't work

Well you 'd still need a licence

If you three-or-four-words you need a licence

But what  happens to bed and breakfasts

Well you get

Well



A licence for functions

But you know we have the same problem with things happening in the school uhm that uhm  we were going to be stopped from having school functions that parents were paying to come to because the uh fire  because of fire regulations 

Mm

What about music then

Well we were wondering about that

Cos you see they got round it for the for the for school things  by saying that it was only open to parents and that 

so it wasn't public





Mm

But a music club 's not public you see

You know i music club is like a private f function

People are invited to come to the music club

Nobody knows about it

The problem with that



Yeah

 yes

I still think it might be worthwhile getting in touch with Jane because I know she is always interested in money-spinning activities 

Well I 'll give Martin a call and pass on her phone number if that 's all right

I don't think it 's anything like large enough but

Well he might have to have a smaller concert

I think that you can have a much more elegant one cos it 's a really nice hall 

They might might be able to use it for concerts even if they can't have a  up there





Yes

Yes

I don't think they can hold a dance there

I don't think the floor 's good enough



But it 's a beautiful parquet floor

That 's what I mean 

I mean to say they 'd ruin it 



Mm

Dancing in stilettos

That hall of Martin 's is quite big actually

I mean it look it doesn't look enormous ye

Have you seen the inside of it

No

I 've never been

With the nickel

I 've only ever walked round his house

Lizzie 's

Y You 've seen it haven't you

You went round there and saw

Yes

I have

But I do think that you know it might be worth getting getting in touch with each other that they might both benefit from it 

Well if you don't mind me giving Martin her phone number

Mm

Well I 'm sure it would be all right with Martin

Martin is a quite well-known person round here

It 's quite possible they 've heard of him anyway

Yes

Yes

I 'll tell Jane that you 've done that

As the local eccentric

In fact I could give her a ring this afternoon

You know what they call him in the music trade

What do they call him







Just that

Just Martin





Does he know this

Yes

I think so

Probably



Poor old whinnier



What is he whinning whinnying about

 



Well have you been 



Oh I think he 's more upset about this than anything else I 've ever seen 



Who Winston

No

M Martin of course

Oh I see 

Well he must have known he was s sailing close to the wind when he built that place

He must have done

But somehow he  somehow he

I Is he upset because one of his guests shopped him 

Presumably one of his unsatisfied customers must have shopped him

It was an architect who was one of the audience  who had a word with Martin afterwards and said look I uh don't believe that 

and did you know that

And Martin said well you know we can't do well we can't do everything at once Peter

We 've got to make these concerts happen

We 're going to get on to that

And the next day someone came over from  

three-or-four-words

Really

Kno He knows He knows who shopped him

He doesn't know personally who it is

I mean he 'd probably recognise him again



Mm

Bit ungrateful wasn't it

Obviously he didn't enjoy the concert





They 're usually sold out

And they 're expensive

They 're not cheap 

Mm

The dance hall 's very expensive too 

Is that his main source of income

His only source of income

Does he farm his land 

Uh no

Not really

In a half-hearted way 

But he 'd

I don't know if he appears in the Newbury guide any more



The interior of his house does equ is does 

His house has been done in the in the sense that it 's got fire doors and fire extinguishers in the right places and fire alarms and everything







Mm 



Anyway that means no dance on the twenty-eighth 

Were you going to be playing in it

Yes 

I was going to ask whether we could 've uh put the children up here that night but

She was thinking Lizzie was thinking of coming but 

Which night uhm

But there 's no point now

Uh Lizzie

You don't want a dishwasher 

 up some me meringue and cream left here

Well this is meringue and ice cream





It all comes out a mixture 

What was that noise



Was that your spoon Peter





Hello

 

Good

Your  seems to have done the trick which is

Well it does help

Will what would you like

I speak as one who doesn't normally care for wine of this density but it is good

Some of that please



I think that you can have a much more elegant one cos it 's a really nice hall 

They might might be able to use it for concerts even if they can't have a  up there





Yes



Dense wine



Mm

three-or-four-words

Well isn't that the name of his wife

Maria De La Tour or something like that

 pudding

No

It 's the name of a French 

But I do think that you know it might be worth getting getting in touch with each other that they might both benefit from it 

Town

Well I know

I can see that on the map

Roger you 're being talked to

Sorry

Talked at

No 

Ah 

Thanks

I wouldn't be surprised if he were found hanging on the end of that phone very shortly so I 'd dial quickly if I was you 

Makes phone calls quite a lot 

Tea

he makes tea he makes phone calls he makes gets me lollipops

I 'm telling you this is what he does 

Look at this

No wonder you 're chairperson

Who else do I know that can count like this 

Why are you always in such a hurry and looking so hassled

I am not around for the next two weeks

that 's all

I 'm in college but I do not want to have anything to do with society for two weeks 

I 'm in severe stress work-wise

I think you 're doing fine

You 're not you 're not seeing ner seeming nervous or as if you need encouragement to me

Do you think you need encouragement

Oh yes

Come on

Oh do am I supposed to burst out into  nervous  paroxysms

No

But you 're not showing any signs of being uh uh ill at ease which is why I haven't uh seen it necessary to encourage you because you seem to be quite  confident and able to answer the questions and 

Should I be ill at ease

No

But you were saying I 'm supposed to be encouraging you

I said I only encourage people who look as though they need it

You don't look as if you need it

You look quite happy

Uhm  so what you were saying is at the time you didn't consider that it was your mother 's fault that he 'd left and uh 

How bothered

Oh I see what you mean

Therefore you haven't bothered

Mm

No because obviously

I mean just  because as I said first of all you don't understand any of the deeper logic behind why a relationship breaks up and therefore  in just this most simple of sort of toy-room terms you can understand that one minute there are two people here the next minute one has gone

Therefore  you probably think  isn't it more likely that the one that 's gone  did the active going

You probably go for the person who 's there  and obviously because you 're with that person more of the time

But uh uh I I wouldn't discount that entirely

but I think it 's also not just the usual argument of oh but the child 's with that one and so they think that one is the one that 's in the right

it 's also just the the mere fact that it was he that left  you know not  not she that left with you



You make it all sound so simple James 

Uhm  have you considered until now the effects that having an absent father may have had on your childhood

Tell me about your life

Sorry

The effects that

That having an absent father may have had on your childhood

Have you considered the influences of it on your childhood

Yeah

Uhm  well  first of all  uhm  it undoubtedly made me  very single-minded very independent very competitive

But my assessment of that  which may be  psychological covering up of the truth

but my assessment of that is that has as much to do with simple economic facts rather than deep-seated Freudian need to prove myself etc etc

I think that 's more I think that 's heavily overplayed by people

I think that 's much more straight fact that we didn't have any money

so if you weren't very bright and won and win scholarships  you wouldn't you wouldn't uh be at school any more

It wasn't because I wanted to be Prime Minister of England

it 's just I want to go to school thank you

And the second thing that you have to appreciate about m me is that in depth I 've always felt that uhm  I think subconsciously at the beginning  as I moved towards university more consciously that I I would always have to be ten per cent better than anybody else 

Well I mean that 's what I uh

I was going to say which is true

I don't mean it like that but  which is true to some extent particularly when I was working in the City uh which is highly competitive and highly knife knife-in-the-back uhm you do have to be

if you 're going to make up for that you have to be smartish

So I think it 's as much that that makes me a driven person as  you know what you 're discussing here today 

Mhm



Mm

So all those things right you could I could go on to say then that all these things being true had you just had your father been there  and had you just had not much money all these things would therefore have been true and therefore from what you 're saying having an absent father may had no effect on your childhood whatever

No

No because uh of

No

I wasn't saying that because if he had been there then there wouldn't have been an economic problem and there there wouldn't have been that side of being driven 

But  listen

there are three things I 'm saying and they are divided in into two

One which are irrelevant to talking about the father the deafness in particular

and  perhaps just genetically some people are more driven than others

Right

That has an effect

Now on the side to do with the father I 'm saying that many people want to attribute driven competitive personalities to absent fathers

I mean that 's standard 

I 'm saying that while there may be an element of that I think that is often overstated and in fact there was a much more mundane economic result and that and that

Well so so therefore if he was there  first of all all of this deafness genetics would still be there  right and second of all the uhm  uh the economics  uhm  and the psycho well the psychological problem probably wouldn't be there but a and the economics problem would be washed away but  I 'm saying that since all of this would still be here

Oh but you could just have not had enough money

Mm

I understood you the first time

Yes

But why would what I 'm saying is why would the why would it be washed away if the father was there

You could just have had a two parent family where your father was there and you just didn't have enough money so you had to have a scholarship

So you could still have been deaf and still have been  

Yes

But he

Wha what I 'm saying is all those other things

you could just have had a father who was there but didn't have an enormous amount of money

But the boy 's loaded

Well now we 're getting pretty hypothetical

Well we are getting hypothetical

but I 'm saying what are the effects do you think of an absent father on your childhood

and you 're looking at them purely it seems to me in financial terms

you could have had a hard up father and then

Ah because there 's big gap between a

Ah ah ah

No because you 're missing out one important thing 

and that is that lots of life is not about reality versus what it what it could have been hypothetically

it 's about the gap between reality and what it might very realistically have been

i e if you are born in the Gorbals and there 's absolutely no chance of your having any money well then you grow up as a normal Gorbals-born person

If however you were born in the Gorbals as an illegitimate child of Lord so-and-so and your mother keeps telling you that Lord so-and-so is around the corner in X Y Z Crescent then that has a marked difference upon the way you see the world

Right

All right

All right

Uhm

But that 's your major problem with the absent father problem if if economics is a problem

You 're saying well supposing you just had a poor father but it 's much more than that

it 's a fact that  you 're suffering and you know that had that particular father that you 've got been there you wouldn't be

Yes 

But the question was  the eff the effects that having an absent father may have had on your childhood  and your

This is all

And I accept that this is a major area

are there any other areas  that you think any other effects

Well I started off  I started off  I st

OK

Uhm ce ce well uh just to recap

So we agreed that there was independence competitiveness  uhm  there was a third one I said before

Well the whole the whole drivenness of working hard

I know

All right drivenness

Uhm  secondly as I mentioned before more difficulty than I suspect I would have had in dealing with men of my father 's age just not knowing how to relate to them 

Uhm  thirdly uhm  mm let me think 

Are we talking about my views now I mean now at my age or my views then 

OK

Well both

Well un undoubtedly which is an area I 'm sure you want to come to you will notice that I 've never married

And uhm sho and there 's no question in my mind that uhm what happened has had an effect a marked effect on that

Uhm  I mean  the key figure that always pulsates in my mind when I think about the subject is married for six years divorce court for eighteen

And  you know that 's  it 's not  as it might be to some God I wouldn't want my children to suffer like I did because I don't feel I did suffer 

In fact you know you know without sounding smug about it uhm I did very nicely thank you

so what you know

I mean I just think  to me that is not a factor uh and I think a lot of people use it and overplay it

But the factor about not getting married is definitely that

Now  the fourth point which is more subliminal it 's

you probably would never get me to admit to it

but every girlfriend I 've ever had wants to tell me for obvious reasons is that uhm I have a deep rejection complex and that the reason I  shy away from forming permanent long-term relationships is a fear of rejection and hence  that translates into a need for control always and 

Some of that 's probably true

You notice that I put spontaneous on my

Did I put spontaneous on my 

What 's very interesting is when I re when after this is written up when I 'm reading over it then I I see more in it than I can initially taking notes

OK

Well I 've got to move because we  we got quite a lot to get through and we uh we 're spending a long time on each 

We 're going on

OK

I 've only got five more minutes

Have you really

Exactly

Mm

I think so

Well you must be be slightly more succinct then

Uhm uh is there a relation or connection between a particular event or events and your views about your father 

Uh sorry

I don't know what you mean

Do I have a mnemonic

This is a this is a

No

I I mean

Sort of tag for that or what

How do you mean

I mean an event

Are there any particular events that you remember about your father 

Uhm  and your views about your father

That 's what I meant

Yeah



Oh yeah  I remember I remember uhm 

Well on the good side I can remember the uh  excitement of going to lots of motor races  and I remember the quite good feeling of at school  when everybody came in and anything from Bentley Turbos to uhm  oh yeah Triumph Two Thousands

I 'd always know that my father was coming because there 'd be this sort of   into the yard and this  Lotus usually with numbers on it would appear

And of course that had great cachet at school so I suppose I remember that uhm 

And  I mean these are really just the two memories that I last had of him up until springtime last year which I 'm sure I 'll come to

Uhm  at school

And that 's sort of the good side

The bad side

I always remember being taken out to tea once

And uhm he said now the good news uh I just I have some really good news for you you see

So I thought oh good 

So he said Sandra who is this woman who I 'd  sort of been surreptitiously introduced to in London Zoo the way one is to one 's father 's mistress uhm  was going to have a baby uh which I can remember almost  as aged fourteen I think splurting the soup back into my or or the tea back into my cup

I mean for example

Yeah

What

In horror or amazement

Uh uh well uh horror

I don't know

just sort of  everything

I don't really know that I analysed exactly why I sprayed it back into my cup

but ho uhm not really horror but just 

So I suppose I didn't then have an immediate oh my god this means that he 's really distancing himself

but perhaps subconsciously you you realise that

Amazement

So  uhm  this is a ridiculously generalized question that I start off with

only it gi gives you an opportunity to moan if it 's an impossible sort of question to answer

But uhm  what do you think about the role of the father today kind of in general 

Uh you mean in society  as it were

Yes 

Mm 

Yes

That is a difficult question

Uhm  uh  one would 

Hmm

Let 's see now 

The role of the father in the family I mean or or anything general that you

Any general thoughts

Yeah

Yeah

I   uh 

Well I do I think I do think that a a father  should be around

I suppose  something like that but uh  uh 

but uh you know sort of  a responsibility to his family I suppose  uhm  if he decides to have children

Uhm  what actual specific role he should fulfil within the family I

I wouldn't  sort of want to

Mm

OK

Perhaps you could tell me a little bit about your own father

Uh  well yes

Yes

Uhm  my Dad 's uh  an actor

Uhm  he 's very uh he 's very nice really

He 's very charming

Uhm  he is  uh well he 's been married several times

Uhm  I don't know

how detailed do you want me to get really because I could go off  I could talk quite a long time about my father on a question like this and in what kind of way  do you want him described as a as a person 

Well

Well uh bearing in mind I know nothing about him at all I mean

All right

Uhm  well I 'm bound to say he 's he 's an actor 

He 's very charming

He 's very nice

Uhm  uh  he 's a good cook  uhm

He 's been married

He 's been married three times 

Uh now he 's just going through a divorce again

Uhm  uhm  uh and uh he always seems to find it rather difficult

He I 'd say he 's uh he finds it difficult to look at himself  if you see what I mean and see his own responsibility for the marriages not working out or is it anything to do with him

Uhm he finds that very difficult to cope with

Uhm  uh  the reason I 'm qualifying myself is that sometimes if I 'm talking about my father I tend to  make him seem a bit like an ogre in some ways uh 

And he 's not like that when you meet him he

he is very nice and he 's mellowed a lot over the years I think

He 's uh uh He 's got a lot more thoughtful

And certainly especially over the last three or four years uhm with the divorce he 's just going through I think he 's actually started to listen to people a bit more  and uh he 's become more considerate about other people 's feelings

Uhm

Mm

You 're a child of which marriage

Uh the first marriage

And there were how many children

Uh two 

Me and my sister

You and your sister

And you 're  older than your sister

That 's right

Yes 

You were the oldest

Uhm  were you uh uh having any particular feelings about him when you were a child of say less than eight 

Of eight uhm

What What age were you when he went in fact

Uh I was around about  two or three 

Uhm I actually  find it quite difficult to remember very much about  my being very young

I can't certainly can't remember him being around  at all

Uhm  and I think it happened before I was eight uhm 

I think my oldest memories tend to revolve more around my mother than my father uh  about her not being on her own

Certainly  I 've never found it  particularly strange that I didn't have a father around that I was in a one parent family

It never seemed odd I think partially because uhm my mother knew quite a few people who were in one parent families

So a lot of my friends were in one parent families as well so it didn't seem particularly odd not having a father  I think

I mean I certainly can't can't it does it does I don't remember it being being odd

Uhm  we used to see him at Christmas and once or twice a year

but it was very rare that we saw him when I was when I was uh very young

Until I was about really twelve I suppose we maybe saw him once or twice a year because he was  uh jet-setting around quite a lot really uh and going off and doing things and travelling around so that he 'd catch up with us

And  And I uh used to get maybe it was five five pounds as a birthday present which was always good to have because it was real  cash you know

so it was kind of uh  materialistic kind of uh  uh thing

Mm

Mm

Mm

Can you describe to me if possible a typical day in your home when you were a boy of less than fourteen

Uhm  uh typical a typical day uhm 

Right

School day School day 'd be a typical day yes

Uh we 'd get get get up

You know then my sister 'd get up and uh  uh have breakfast and then  go to school

Uhm  depends how far back you take it really

When I was at uhm  When I was at primary school uhm I really didn't like going to school and I used to pretend that I 'd be sick

As I remember it used to be sort of like fairly common for a Tuesday  that I 'd pretend to be sick   and so I didn't have to go to school

I got quite good at like heating up thermometers and stuff and give myself a temperature and things

Uh once I went to secondary school for some reason or other although I complained about it more I actually didn't mind going in

So there 's two different patches there if you see what I mean

There 's my pre-secondary school and and post uhm

Excuse me a moment 

Didn't like going to school

Uhm  uh what I didn't like uh  was leaving my mum really

I think that was it

I was I was insecure

Uhm  I can remember that I mean it was it was particularly bad at primary school

I can I can remember I can remember the first day 

I can remember vividly my first day at primary school

I cried a lot

And uh And then I mean it seemed so to speak  if you like they really weren't sure whether they were going to be able to keep me on there because I created such a scene about being left on my own

Yes well I 'd been going to nursery school before that and I can even remember

But that was just up the road  from

Yeah

But it was only for an hour or two so I didn't feel quite so bad

But uh uhm  it was so long uh at primary school I really

I didn't like it

why I pretended to be ill

That was to to get to spend an extra day at home

Uhm  but at secondary school I think you know I I started to  cope with it a bit better really 

I think I was feeling a bit more secure 

Mm

Yeah

Your life is ordered for you

I mean there is certainly uncertainty there but not  

I tend to find more uncertainty as I left home just because I mean I knew I had to go to school and do things really that were provided 

Balanced is a difficult one

I just don't know uhm 

Ah I mean I

Mm

But it says something that you 're not saying it definitely is or it definitely isn't I mean which suggests that it was balanced in some ways and not in others

Mm 

Yes yes

I suppose

Yes yes

Yes

I know

Uh again I liked  uh because I certainly wasn't sad

If one weren't happy

Again it 's no good to say like it was always fun

I mean there 's a kind of feeling that I 'd I 'd get that I might say that yes there was

It I mean yes there was elements of it that were fun

Yes

I mean

But I mean some people would just say  yes it was a load of fun or it was no fun at all 

You know they 'd just it would either be a  or it wasn't relevant

Mhm

Well I 'd say it was I 'd say it was

Yeah

Well yeah 

Uh it 's not what I 'd pick out

That 's uh That 's what I was thinking

I 've been fairly happy  and like well it is something that I tend to look back on and and I suppose it is to a certain extent

Religious is a difficult one because I actually went actually went to a church school  uhm  primary school uh  which was  

Yeah

Mmm

So you don't know whether whether it was  a positive experience or a negative experience

Well a little bit

It it it depends what in  It depends what you mean in positive or positive or negative way

Uhm I 'm not a religious person and my mum isn't really particularly either so in the environment at home there wasn't uh it wasn't uh a strong feature of life and I knew it quite a lot about it

On the other hand I went to the church school and uh  uhm and I think I got a reasonably kind of although I 'm not uh straightforwardly religious I 've got a an appreciation of its strong of the strong points of religions 

Uhm so I wouldn't say that I actually looked on religion as a bad thing if you see what I mean

It 's just that that it is

Mm

Mm

Right

So you didn't have a lot of religious pressure but nor did you have a lot of religious thought

They kind of both got in the middle column

OK

Well that 's fine

That That 's fine

I 'll just leave them in the three columns then 

I can uh 

OK

Yeah 

Yeah

Yeah

 

I mean obviously we could talk round about about these but this is just a  it just gives me a general picture 

OK 

Uhm  imagine that you 're aged ten and your mother 's speaking about your father

What sort of things might she have said 

Uhm well she 'd have she 'd have tried to be as fair as she could

But uh uhm it  it depends what you looked for really

but she she would do her absolute best not to say nasty things about him to try to not necessarily positively reinforce  our views on him but try to not let us see how angry  she was really

But you could you could tell

Did she succeed

No

No

She didn't succeed really I mean like

you knew that uh although we like we we me me and my sister knew that uh that uh  she didn't overtly 6-7-words I mean like the thought of things that he 'd done and so forth

she hadn't got over what uh had happened 

But she wouldn't say that no good bastard

he 'd have never do anything for us or anything

No

She wouldn't She wouldn't do that

No

She 'd She 'd absolutely try not to

Uhm given a little bit of an excuse she could be negative about him you see but it would need to be she 'd need to be prompted more or less

It would need to be definitely something which she 'd not

She 'd agree with somebody if sh if they said that no good bastard 's done this to me

She 'd go oh yes yes I know

I know what he 's like

You know

But she wouldn't ever uh actually say anything bad about him 

Right 

So what sort of things might she have said then 

I mean if you imagine that she 's actually speaking about him

Uhm  it 's difficult actually

I can't

I mean she didn't really talk about him as such

she 'd commiserate I suppose if  if uh he 'd done something that had upset one of us

Now I mean I know uh from experience this was probably she probably was speaking to  more than me because I  wasn't 

There was not a lot that my Dad did that I particularly took on board and let it get to me

What 's the problem

I put it on to the actually supporting letter 

Right

Fine

And uhm I went to print

and it won't print because it keeps on saying feed paper

Now the paper looks all right

so I wondered if how did it go with its ink 

Ah

Right

I don't think it will be

What you do first is just to switch it off

Switch it off and switch it on again

And switch it on again 

Uhm 



I 've done that a couple of times

Have you really

Mm 

And it seemed to stay on line for some reason

So that 's stayed on line now 

OK

How would we do it if it was paper

How would we know if it was uhm  ink  other than paper 

Just that it will be very faint and leave paper out

Infuriating things aren't they

I think it would get faint

Uhm  I ought to bring the manual down

I just wonder what what we do when we can't uh communicate 

Do we go downstairs and get a cassette

You get another one

Uh do you know it fits

It should say

A cassette isn't it

Yeah

You just pull that out  I think

Right

And push it in there 

OK

Yeah

It 's very easy to  to reprocess

Right

OK

Well now the main problem was that uhm I brought up the supporting letter  and started playing around with it

I put my own address in  and the  and changed the date 

And uhm  then I wanted it I said I didn't want it protected  and I

and I also said I didn't want it saved 

But it 's it I can't get rid of it now 

It 's gone on there

But I I I saved I I said I didn't want it saved

and I also deleted everything else

Right

Right

Right

If you didn't it saved uh it would have 1-syllable 

Have you had a previous  version on there

No 

I mean I was only got the master one

I was editing the master

I wasn't doing one  on my own

OK

If you didn't ask for it to be saved then it would still be the master one on there I think

Yes

But it 's it it isn't

It 's changed to my address

 

Now  I 'll show you how if you look uhm 

now escape to get back to that 

Uh one thing I do find

when you 're in the middle of a thing you can't get back to this can you

you have to 

If you 're in the middle of doing something 

Well never mind

uhm if we say we want to view it  right  and that 's example one  and we move to view

And I haven't checked into that number for that one

And that 's my address 

Now I said well I want to get rid of that so I deleted it manually by deleting  like that

Right 

Uh I did actually do that 

And then I also  and it didn't delete it 

I also escaped and went back  and deleted that but that way 

Oh this has done it  and it didn't seem to want to work for me you see

Right

Right

Right 

View document

Right

Go Go back to edit

OK

Now

Well yeah

Let 's see what there is now

Edit

Now we 've got two haven't we 

We 've got example one or example one

Yeah

So I guess we 've still got that one up there 

Well let 's have a let 's have a look at that one  and let 's have a look at address 

It 's still there

OK

So  let 's  delete that

F eight

Clear it

Yeah 

It all fits in this section this

Well does it fit

I did try F eight actually 

Yes

Uhm  now if we save that

What

You save to clear do you

Well it sa

You You just go back and he 'll say 

do you want to save it

Oh I see

I probably said no 

Maybe I should have 

OK

If you didn't save it then it would have saved it as it was before 

That 's the original one

If you save it now  as example one  example already exists do you want to override so you answer yes 

Answered unprotected 

OK

Let 's scrub that one 

You still got two called example one and I don't know quite why there are differences there

Right 

Yeah

Cleared

Yeah

Wait oh yes right

This is why and the same thing happened with the other letter didn't it  another one so you 're trying with this one

Uhm 

Whoops 

Let 's view uhm example one

View 

Now we 've got rid of that there

Ah we 've got rid of it 

Good 

Now we got a funny date up there

Well that was

Oh yes

Well I did start putting the date

then my typing wasn't very good so as you see I was putting the new date in and I obviously hadn't deleted the rest of it

Right OK

OK

Let 's have a look at that date

it tells you why

Yeah

If you just open that top one top one

Oh right

Twenty-fourth

How 're you going to delete that

You 're going to clear

are you OK  or what

I I don't know what what

I was just going to leave a date in here

Well that twenty-third of September is the standard date in the thing 

I mean that 's the

Well let 's leave it at that twenty-fourth of March nineteen ninety-two

Yeah 

OK 

OK 

Shall we put  something for our address and telephone number

What

Just to see if it works or something

Well just so that there is a

Yes

Sure

Why don't you put something in there 

OK uhm 

Let 's see if it fits 

Ha  fits

That 's all right

This is another thing I did

To somebody that doesn't know it  Uh   for somebody that isn't aware of the keyboard I just took quite a long time to find a capital letter 

You know you don't think of those things

do you

You see when you 're typing you 've got a thing down here very often for caps 

You know  I mean that I didn't

What 's that

Well you have down there as well

Which

Yeah

But that locks it into caps

Yeah

But that 's that 's

Oh that 's the same one

is it

Oh good

Yeah

I know

Then you do that uh brightener to view 

Oh I 've forgotten now

this is the same as that 

up quick

Now does it go up that way

What 's it doing

What d' you want to change

I want to change everything

It 's just the 

No

That 's all right

leave it at

Oh I see

OK

Now we want to write on it

Right 

OK 

Sussex 

No

That 's the  pound sign 

Use the capital there

Oh yes

Oh I see

Yes

I know 

Yeah

That 'll do

OK

OK

Save

Now escape 

Oh were you you must put a telephone number

And then you 

Oh

Do I Do you put a telephone number in there

Well that 's what it says 

Where does it say

Address and telephone number

Oh right

I haven't noticed it

Yes

The trouble is you tend not to read these bits of things 

You should Michael but I don't read the screen  uh 

I think the general problem that people don't read screens

I don't myself uhm

Don't you

Oh right

Don't you see I 'm asking you these things and that and very often it 's actually come up somewhere 

You don't read screens

do you

No right

Mm

No

No

I think it 's a  i it 's a bad way of communicating with people

Mm

I can't remember what telephone numbers are like

Five five five  five two three six seven

Well any one

That 's OK 

And then you would go on to F ten wouldn't you

No

No 

Best kept secret

No

Well I mean if you wanted that to go on to the next thing could you not just go ahead on to the next thing

to date

I think you can

can't you



Sorry

Yes

You could  if it i uh if you 're going to do that yes I 'm sorry

Uh I had I thought that was the only change you were going to make in there

Yeah  yeah

So now if I wanted to view uhm a whole 

Now I think you have to save it first

Ah yes

D' you want to save it

The answer is yes

We do

don't we 

I want to save it 

Document already exists

Do we save that

Answer yes

Oh this is why it was called  one

wasn't it 

Uhm do I want to type this or not

No

No 

OK

Now go across to view 

What I thought I 'd get these printed out because I hadn't actually got the support letters printed out 

Right

So I 'll get it printed out 

Right

Hello

Can I help you

Yeah

I just wondered if I can  if these are to take away

I mean if there were students

Yes

Help yourself

Is there anything on there I can take or

Anything that doesn't say anything on it you can have 

Oh what 's that

Law

That legal profession is about the best uh  

then we 'll take your name up 

Oh right yeah  I 'll come back then

Uhm 



Right 

Now change that to fifty-eight 

No you have to back space 

Yes 

Does it actually print the uhm 

Ah yeah 

We said yes

we didn't pull the switch

Did you not say it was best to say yes uh

No

It doesn't actually matter but if you say no it 's all right

OK 

Mm

OK 

Right 

That 's improved 

Don't think that it will be

Mm 

Don't know the reason for it 

Did they just do the one example letter on here recovering supporting letter 

It just worries me

Oh I think there is 

Oh that 's very lucky

isn't it 

Yeah

Let 's print it out 

Now  having changed that fifty-eight it stays at fifty-eight  while you are using the program 

If you exit and do  and then come back then it it 's changed again yeah

I I don't know how to change the overall beetle

Shall I print it out now

Right

Right

Yeah  goes back to that

You wouldn't like to leave in at sixty-one then would it for this  or would it

I think it probably would uhm 

we can check it

print letter one uhm 

Well it doesn't matter

It 's a single sheet on that so 

Usually that happens because something touches it when it 's wet uhm when the ink is still wet there 

Yeah

That 's OK

Oh right

Yeah

That 's all right

So now it 's better not to just turn off 

That 's OK

That 's OK that one

Well you 've got it

Set to fifty-eight

Set to fifty-eight  uhm as long as

Right

These are quite smart aren't they for the schools conference super badge

I know

Yes

Isn't it

I think I might get us sort of a set for all of us

Oh that 's rather nice

isn't it

Yes

Yes

 set uhm

I 'll go and look 

Oh yes  though

Yes

Right 

Oh we were going through the uh  I was showing Mike and uh Dinah on Thursday

and we were going through the C V 

and we were backing to the uhm  F one is it you know the instructions on this account

It 's quite time-consuming

isn't it

It would take a long time

Right

Right

Right

Yes

I think it would take uh oh three-quarters of an hour to an hour for somebody to start who didn't have any any  any experience at all

Yeah 

That 's right

That 's what we were doing

Right

What I 've done I don't know if you think think it 's a good idea but we 've got this work window over by the bar which is a  lousy area

Oh are you

Are you

Hi

Hi

uhm d' you know what the uhm access funds are looking like this term

Is it

What do you mean

Like how many people have applied what 's likely to get the money 

uhm

I think  again  ha roughly half the people that have applied got money from it

Uhm  a lot of the money seems to have gone a lot of the large sums seem to have gone to postgraduates

Really

Uhm  the letters are being sent out tomorrow

You should receive notification next week some point telling you whether or whether you haven't got any money from the fund

H how much is that like the smaller sum

It ranges from a hundred pounds

I 'm not sure what the highest amount they 've paid out this term is

Really

But the the starting amount 's a hundred  upwards and like in fact seems to have gone to postgrads 

Well

people nearing the end of their course 

Uhm

Really

OK right

Thanks a lot

Sorry

What happens with T V licences

You don't get a criminal record do you 

No

Didn't you pay one

Uhm

what happened is uh  they caught her without a licence

and the following day she applied for one

She sent off for one and then she 's got uhm a court order 

Did you get

Uhm

They came round on the third and I got my licence on the fifth

But basically they came round

and I didn't have one at the time

and I got that through this morning 

The other page is first actually 

Right 

You know

the problem with that is they can fine up to twelve hundred pounds

Yeah 

Yeah

I 'm not sure if you 've got 

So I don't I don't get a criminal record then

I 'm just looking that up

I 'm not sure whether it 's a criminal offence or not

Well then it just well it doesn't say anything about it when I went through in here 

 

It would say if it was a criminal offence

It 's a fine 

Is it best that I do attend court

Uhm the only exceptions is where the student 's parents have a television set 

Yeah I 'd heard something like that

I heard that

Do your parents have a licence

Yeah

Yeah

Then it 's quite clear

isn't it

Yeah I heard something like that

Apparently if you 'd if your parents have got one then you don't  have to 

Let 's see 

 more than one people can have own one licence in the law

I think it could mean that if you have  you have to register under that licence  in that  house 

Yeah I 've got that as well

But it is

My parents ' house is in 

Where is that then 

three-or-four-words

So really they can't they can't pay anything then 

Is your television recorder hired or or

What with buying with buying my T V

Yeah

Well I 've got a T V at my parents ' house but my T V three-or-four-words

We rented it

You rented it 

The thing is that would make  all students exempt practically all students exempt from having a television licence

Uhm

And that 's not the case 

No 

Students only  and the students pay for the television licence

It 's only when you 've got you know you can get those battery operated televisions

It 's only if you have one of them and your parents have a licence that you 're covered under that

Otherwise you 're not covered under your  parents ' licence

Uhm  are you gonna appear in court or are you going to

Oh right

Do they

Well I dunno don't know

What would be best 

I really don't know 

Right 

What I would suggest is

we 're on the  twelfth now

aren't we

Right

On the twenty-fifth of March  we 've got an appointment to go and see the solicitors at the Mary Ward Legal Centre right

It 's before the date 

and what I would suggest is that we make you an appointment to go and see one and talk it through

They 'll be able to tell you the best thing to 

I 'm not sure what would be the better in your interest whether you 'd be guilty by or you go and you try and prove your case

Uhm 

but they 'd be able to tell you what your best course of action is

Yeah  yeah

So I wouldn't be able to send that off until 

No it 'd be a bit difficult 

Right it says that the court case isn't until the thirteenth of April

This is only the twenty-fourth of March

so it still leaves you a couple of weeks

so if they suggested that  it would be better just to plead by this and send it off it will still get to court in time 

Yeah

No it doesn't say anything about a criminal record in here so

Yeah 

The thing is even if they fine us all of us are completely overdrawn

What would what would happen then cos I just can't afford to pay a four hundred pound fine

Yeah it says

If you said that you couldn't afford to pay it what they usually do is do an income and expenditure 

so they ask you how much money you 're getting how much money you 're paying out

and then on the amount of money  that you have they work out a sum that they think is reasonable for you to pay back every week or every month 

They would usually do that in a case  

But I mean it 's still a case of

It has been known I mean

I have known people that have said  said

I really can't afford to pay this

and they said

well

it doesn't matter

you 've got to pay it

but usually what they 'll do  is do that and work out some reasonable repayment plan 

It it says on the back here that as long as if you want to plead  guilty by writing as long as

Uhm

Yeah

Yeah

Two eight four five  divided by thirty-eight  which is all the terms plus Christmas and Easter gives you a grand total of seventy-four pounds and ninety-six per week  plus  uhm six six O divided by fifty-two which is your student loan  which is twelve

so basically you 've got eighty-six pounds a week to live on

Yeah

After paying rent and travel that gives you clear  sixteen pounds a week  over the term time 

So there 's no argument

I mean 

Oh yeah

I mean it 's hopeless for getting books  

I mean

there is absolutely no way unless you 're going to have private resources or some other  you know apart from jobs that anybody is going to manage to get through the year a year in private accommodation on that and no grants unless they do not eat

You can't walk from Golders Green

and it 's at least that you don't have to come from Golders Green 

OK

I I mean

I don't know whether

what can we do

Hopefully they 'll ring me up  and say 

we 'll give you a call get in touch with you 

Do you think the letter addresses the issues

No  yeah yeah

Yeah

Yeah I think it does

Yeah

It does

I mean that I think if you  send that to him he 's got to address the issue  this time certainly

I mean  he can't just send me a bill like that

OK

I mean

thinking about it it 's stupid of them not to  cos basically if you default in the summer simply 

Yeah

Mmm 

And he 's got enough time now to find some more tenants and he 's only got to find some three months after anyway

Yeah

It 's stupid

We 're not staying for another year  

He 's got as much chance as anyone else

I know

I think so too

OK I 'll send it

If uh actually what department are you again

Institute of Archaeology 

If he answers me I 'll drop you a note

If you don't hear anything in about two weeks come back

All right obviously come back before the end of term

Yeah I will do

I mean I can't see how it could take him that long

He 'll get that tomorrow morning

Yeah well the insurance will 

OK

Right OK then

Thanks a lot

All right

Let 's hope it works

Yep

Thanks a lot

OK

Bye now

Cheers 

Apparently she couldn't be bothered to come upstairs

That 's why she rang up 

Bit cheeky innit isn't it

She was at the coun counter reception and I was talking to the old guy for a while 

I mean d did you mean Derek

I think he means Derek

Oh sorry 

Right

Was it you just ringing up

Right

What is it again



It 's youth in action

Right

I went to the meeting

but I can't uh  find where I 'm supposed to hand it in

I haven't finished the form yet anyway

I just wanna want to find out

Weren't you given an address or anything like that to

Well there 's an address in here

but it 's in the U S A but I 'm sure he said Karen or something 

He said to hand it in to Karen

He didn't say anything abou about posting it off to America

It 's not uhm  an anyone in campus

is it

Campus Travel

No no

It it  don't know what it is

It just said America Europe exchange  thing

three-or-four-words

Is it an academic exchange

No no 

Dunno don't know

It 's the it 's the whole university

Not camp who gave you the form

This guy called Randy from California who came over 

You 're sure he 's not pulling your leg

aren't you

Yeah and I went to this meeting on Friday

OK

Wh b wh where was the meeting

Windeyer Building

Windeyer staff dining room 

And the idea

T tell me how the scheme works

Well

it 's basically you go over and stay with someone for three weeks

and then it 's five weeks the whole thing

and then you do what you want to do so then they come over and stay with you

Just students in America

That it 's not academic or

it 's just like a cultural

Are you sure you just haven't got to send it off to the the American address

Well I think maybe I 'll have to

What would you say

He just I 'm s sure

he said something about a woman called Karen

Not Sarah 

Not that

It could be Sarah Hibbet in the 

Try the International Office

See if they can get  on the telephone

See if they know anything about it

That 's a pretty good idea actually

isn't it



Uhm  

It wasn't Terry

was it

Not Terry no

That 's that 's the general manager

Yeah that 's what I think

Maybe he 'll know something about it but no it was 

How about uhm  finding out who booked the room in the Windeyer

Who booked it

Not Derek is it

Was it a booked an advertised session

Y yeah it was in the staff dining room all day on Friday in the Windeyer

What I recommend you do Tony is go over there and as a U C  student get yourself a copy

Uhm

OK well I 'm  I 'm quite happy

Well he just handed that to me

Yeah OK

I didn't uhm I mean I 'm a student elsewhere

I didn't turn it down

I just said oh thank you very much yeah

Thank you very much that 's very sweet 

So

But you don't I mean it 's a I mean you 're welcome to have a look at this one but I need it back because I 'm gonna go for it myself

But I think you sh I think you should go over and get yourself one

Yeah 

I 'll go and get one

They have there 's hundreds of them

I couldn't believe it

Yeah

I 've seen they got loads of books in there

I haven't taken anything but  OK

I 'll go and have a look 

What schools are you interested in

Uhm Kent University

But that that would be like a full-time master 's

A an M B A

One year full-time

Uhm   and South Bank Poly cos it thing is I 've been told it 's probably better to get it at a uni at a university 

Get some qualification

and then what I can do with it afterwards is

Probably yeah

Some of the stuff

Yeah

Some of the stuff that 's been in the press

They 're almost doing a league now 

I mean obviously it used to be that it it it used to be Harvard

I think probably Manchester Manchester Business 

but now there 's so many people offering them

There is definitely and there was a thing in the I think the Sunday Times or the Observer a couple of weeks ago and they 've got articles in the Careers Office about it talking about are they worth whose are worth getting

Which ones are highly thought of

Uhm

Yeah

Exactly cos I mean there 's the Polytechnic of North London and Central London and sort of South London South Bank uhm   uhm Hatfield Middlesex

Everybody 's doing it

It 's a growth industry

Exactly

And it 's all sort of all booming with  degrees sort of like language bias and information technology bias

and you know you can do all sorts of degrees

The one at uhm Kent University is particularly useful

Cos my first degree 's in French and Spanish

and it has a sort of language you know

so that would be really good

It does sound good

Yeah

It might and the other thing about it is it 's worth asking at the different schools as well about funding

I mean basically U C if you come here they give everybody a piece of paper all postgraduates a piece of paper saying there is no funding I 'm afraid 

But it 's worth it

It 's worth asking

I mean something like that they may well have sponsored places by companies and things like that 

A lot of leg work and lots of letter writing

and you might not get any anything out of it at all

but I think it 's worth asking

Oh dear

Uhm

And what about time because I mean I think in a way I 've left it a bit late  in order to be a favourite

I don't know

I don't know how quickly they fill up

I 've heard people saying the deadline would be sort of July August 

That 's the busy time

isn't it

I mean there will be

Yeah

There 's still time

You see you 're only in March 

You 'll be sitting on the phone at work ringing around

Yeah

Yeah

Where are you working now

I 'm working in a software house in Kilburn

They won't uh sponsor you

No no 

They just give two hundred pounds  and you 've got to stay in the company for two years cos uhm a friend of mine was doing it part-time

I think doing it part-time is really silly because it 's quite a demanding course

Yeah uh cos I know a course with someone who 's doing it at the moment

She 's doing it part-time

She said it has very much taken up with lots more time than she realised

Exactly

The same as my colleague you know

She 's a lot more tired and she sort of like has to take time off work over it

You know I think if you really want to do it you do it properly

you 've got to be able to think to yourself I need a lot of time here

I think I 'm quite looking forward to doing it full-time anyway

three-or-four-words

Uhm 

Yeah well should we go over and uh

Yeah we 'll go now yeah 

OK

Well good luck

Is it I mean once you 've got the st more stuff about it if there 's any anything you wanna want to ask me come back

But they  I mean s cos you were telling me it 's what what I mean to give you a careers interview they 'd charge you twenty-five pounds but there 's a hell of a lot of information Tony could just get by just standing at the counter you know and saying what do you think

Ask about the deadlines

Ask how they think most people are funded now 

and the newspaper articles are quite good

I mean I I get the impression people are borrowing lots of money as well to fund them because supposedly at the other end there 's this big pay-off

Must be a bit of a disaster if there 's not

Uhm

Yeah with a sort of

get a tape recorder

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Yeah I 've heard about that

I remember reading about about big big loans people have  debts people have

Uhm

Exactly

Yeah

I mean really if you were talking of figures like seventy thousand pounds a year and things like that

How true that is

Uhm

Depends what you want to do with it as well

Uhm

Yeah

I guess

Yeah 

Seventy grand a year

Well you should do one Tony

You know  it should be more 

Pay off my grant

My masses of grant from Haringey Council

Exactly yeah

Did you finally get all your cheques by the way

Yeah I did

Yeah

I got them all

I got them all through in the end

And so you 're not going to have a problem for next term are you cos they had all those details

No

Yeah they 've got all the details but next year  uhm I 've still got to tackle that

That 's a little challenge

isn't it

It 's meant to keep everybody in work

I mean let 's ha in if there isn't such people like Haringey there wouldn't be people like me so it 's a a bit of a plus

The more incompetent these people are the more we like it

Yeah right

Yeah

Yeah you 'd be out of a job so

Anyway

OK well

Thanks very much then

Are you s

My pleasure

I hope you find out what you need the information you want

Did you sort out about your glasses

Yeah actually I 've got a form some forms here

Uhm  now  I 'm definitely not going to put down a lie

I 'm I 'm  how I 'm not too sure how much they 're going to check up the sort of figures on what you 're getting in your grant and stuff like that

Well they just assume you get the full entitlement 

They just assume everything 's full

Yeah 

It 's an outrage

isn't it

That is ridiculous yeah

So when it used to be Housing Benefit they would assume that you got all your parental contribution  and so they 'd stick in figures with your paren with like two thousand eight hundred and forty-five or whatever it was then 

and they probably used to come and say we don't get any money from our parents

and they 'd say well I know that

but they just assume you do

and they they 're supposed to calculate the student loan  which works out at twelve pounds a week 

Uhm

Exactly

Uhm

Yes I I think that 's just totally

How how they do class the loans and incomes is

like it 's a farce really

I would I wouldn't m if they want it to be an income fine

Give it to me as an income 

Yeah

I d I can't believe them

I know

Exactly

Give it as a grant

Yeah

Exactly

There 's like there 's you can't they can't get the best of both worlds

It 's like  it 's total hypocrisy

isn't it

It is yeah

It really really is

It 's a farce

Uh I 've got a spare one for you

I don't know if you 're going to use it

Oh thank you they used to let us have them in our of in this office  and then for some reason we like begged and pleaded and wrote and they stopped sending them

I don't know why it was

I used to have a great big pile

Uhm

When I 've finished with these I 'll bring these to you as well right but I 've I need these ones three-or-four-words

Sure

I 've got a whole pile of those actually over there

I mean cos they let us have these those but these we can't get any more

I used to give them out on you know all the time

Oh you have

Oh right

Uhm

Yeah  but I can get

It 's a terrible form as well

isn't it

Don't you think

I have I haven't actually read through it all

but uhm  I can get some more

I can go and grab a load more if you want

Oh it 's a real

Can you just pick them up

Yeah

Just go round to the s Social Security

I I I I I said look cos they they haven't got a clue what their prices are

I want one for my glasses one for my prescriptions uh  uh so

Six for my Mum

Yeah

So I 'll uh yeah I I 'll uhm  you know  when you 're around there again I 'll uh

Yeah it is quite impressive

isn't it

So 

An impressive bit of paper

That 's pretty impressive

I just

We could we should just send everybody

Would they accept photocopies of it

No

I don't think so

I mean it 's a government form

isn't it

Exactly

And they won't give it to you

In in other words they 're trying to st they 're trying to make it more difficult to get hold of it

Yeah well what happened was we used to have them

and Sam wrote and they just never ever

They just send that back

Out of stock and they 've never

One year we had them all the time

Last year we didn't have any

It 's like Social Security work for the government

Really

Uhm

But you can't just pick them up off the counter can you

Yeah you can

But you have to request them don't you cos they they they interview didn't they

Someone could just walk out with it

Do you have to request it

Cos I could just go in there and pick up twenty

Oh no oh you 've got to go and request it

Yes

But I I I could even try going in there and just saying look uhm get a few off them and then saying look uhm I 'm a part of a a s student 's right centre

I 've got a lot of students people who just come in

Yeah

Be great if you would do that

It would be really good

And I 'll I 'll see what I can do

Yes please

Definitely

Cos I 'm al I just send everybody those that 's ill  exactly

Stop stamping on it and give up give me a box 

Yeah

It 's just ludicrous

Anyway we bet you better dash otherwise they 're going to be away

Yes otherwise you 're going miss it

Yeah yeah OK

Well thank you again

Yeah nice meeting you as well

Very nice to meet you

Good luck 

All right Sarah

See you then

Take care yeah

See you later

Bye

Bye bye

You too

Bye bye

Bye

See you then

Thanks

Bye 

Do you want to see my holiday snaps 

Holidays of you looking happy

Pictures of you looking happy on  gorgeously beautiful beaches with tanning  tanned men s basking in the background

No not all of them

On white beaches with blue sea

There 's no tanned men in them 

No tanned men in them

You don't have to look at all of them

Most of them are of people but some of them are nice 

There 's photos of my gorgeous little cousins  

Not

So there 's no gor

Right

OK 

Sure

They 're not going to be mega-ly depressed



No

No no no no no

Well I still want to know what your Plan B is

It 's the wettest November they 've had for twenty-five years

I want to know what your Plan B is

Then I 'll look at your holiday snaps

So what do you think of my plan then

What

to go and meet people

Uhm 

My suggestion 

For you Jenny 

Well

Do you think I should do it

I 'd have to it I 'd have to do it with you 

Well I don't need a man at the moment 

Why

Cos I 've got one

Oh of course  

Well I do

Well yes

I don't know that we uhm should go and do it at the wh

where did you suggest

Well I definitely found I pre I prefer creative people to academics

Well where would you want to go

The showing of the Chippendales  or an estate agent

That would be ideal

No I don't know 

I don't know

Nowhere where people wear frilly bow ties though

Sorry

I said nowhere where people wear frilly bow ties 

No 

Well no

No I don't know

Well I definitely

You 've got some lovely habits

I definitely like Americans

Hah

Yeah I know

I know

I 've also got very clean ears

OK I pick my ears but they 're very clean

Some people have ears you know because I clean them

Some people Some people have ears full of wax because they never do this

I mean which is better

to do this and clean clean the wax out of your ears or to go round with wax in your ears

You shouldn't have put it in your mouth afterwards

I think that 's one of those things you do in private like picking your nose

Is it

What

this 

You can't do this

Well

Only in front of your closest friends

Oh

I suppose so

feel free to pick your bits

I don't mind

Pick your ears

Well I 'd rather a friend picked their ear personally although I don't think I 've ever seen anyone else apart from me do it come to think of it

Yes I 've got some disgusting habits

Well I 'd rather that than when you look round at a close friend of yours and you see a great globule of wax in their ear

I mean that 's really disgusting

How could people be so insensitive as to not know they 've got wax in their ears

Well you 'd tell them then  wouldn't you 

You 'd say I 'm sorry but I have to tell you you 've got a big globule of wax in your ear

Door 's on your left 

you 've got a globule of

yes but I 'd be but I 'd be I 'd be surprised if someone didn't didn't wasn't aware of it

I mean I would know if I got a big globule of wax in my ear because every now and again I stick my finger in my ear and clean it out 

There 's nothing There 's nothing dreadful about sticking your finger in your ear surely

No no no no no

There isn't

Don't you ever stick your finger in your ear 

I don't think I do it in company but then I don't pick my nose in traffic jams either 

Shut up

Oh well I 'm sure the thing the thing about nose-picking is that nobody ever admits to doing it

I have done it but just not not when there 's been anybody else around

Well no but that 's the joke about traffic jams

When I saw my friend picking her nose in a traffic jam  I uhm I thought no no that 's not the place to pick your nose 

Where 's best

Because you feel as if you 're on your own presumably because you 're sitting in a car on your own

but actually there 's lots of people looking through the window

You do

Uhm I have seen people do it before

That was very funny

Some people just don't care where they do it

do they 

No nor picking their noses 

But we weren't going to talk about sex

were we

I haven't had any sex to talk about 

So what would you like for your next man then if you could if you could design him

Well I 'd actually like the same one back again actually

If it 's not too much trouble

Oh Jenny

But it would be too much trouble

It 's going to go on

You don't want a man with two kids and a wife

Come on

No

Everybody else manages to divorce their wives

I don't see why he can't

I don't see what the problem is

Everybody else in the world does it

Well he 's got two kids for one thing

That 's one of the problems

Yes but he doesn't like his wife

No well maybe he likes his kids Jenny

Well it doesn't mean he has to live with them

It 's much better to not have them screaming at each other

The children aren't happy when he 's  when they 're screaming at each other

He admitted his kids were much better when they weren't even living together 

Well I don't know

I still wouldn't wish a married man with two kids on anyone



You know the thing that struck one of the things that struck me about this

there 's a girlfriend of mine whose husband now you have to listen carefully no not whose husband a girlfriend of mine whose man in the man in her life  left his wife for her

Right so someone similar in your position

Uh uhm

But this man walked out on his wife to live with her  and this was about five years ago

The wife was about again a big age gap

Uh uhm

The first wife there 's

there 's a big age gap

No no

Between my friend and the man 

The man is basically old enough to be her father 

and the woman had brought up two kids with this guy and you know lived all her life with him

and basically he pissed off to go out with this young girl

The wife nearly went crazy at being left on her own at I don't know forty or whatever she is

and this this girlfriend of mine when describing a woman I knew exactly who she was describing described someone as unforgiving described this this this woman the wife as unforgiving

I thought bloody hell unforgiving

I should bloody think she 'd be unforgiving 

I mean I mean I 've got a foot you know I 've got a foot in both camps

I 'm quite unusual in that situat in that from that position because I 've not only A I 've been in love with a married man but also I 've had I 've had my husband leave me for a younger woman

Right

Uhm

Uhm





I wouldn't want him to leave her for me but when I met him she 'd already left him and

Yes but obviously by the fact that she wanted him back as I said to you she obviously wasn't leaving him

She was obviously trying to do something to give him a shock trying to motivate him into some kind of action into trying probably I guess into trying to realise that there 's a problem in the relationship  which he wasn't looking at

He was choosing to go off and you know not look at it

So she thought well I I 'll threaten to leave the bastard

I 'll leave the bastard

and then he 'll realise that there 's something wrong

and then he 'll do something about it

and what does he do about it

He goes and meets you

That 's obviously not the reaction well judging from the way she behaved when he you know

I mean if she 'd really wanted to leave him she 'd have she 'd have sent you flowers

She 'd have sent you flowers with a little note that said good luck on

wouldn't she

Uhm

Uhm

If she 'd really wanted to be rid of him 

Uhm

Anyway just just OK well just for the sake of the exercise should you not have him and should you w want to design yourself a new one

what uh

Huh

What particular model would you like

Someone specific

No no

Just design yourself a new man 



You want the older man now

do you

Something over thirty

Yes

Definitely

Absolutely definitely

How How old are we going for here

Over thirty over thirty-five

Over thirty

Thirty five would be just nice

Just thirty-five would be perfect

A mature thirty would even do

Between thirty and thirty-five

Thirty-five would be just nice 

He 'd have a body like Nick rounders bat Nick

Remember him 

Half-caste guy

I remember you describing the rounders bat

Mixed race person should I say

A mixed race person

Mary Jane tells me I shouldn't use the word half-caste

He 's a person of mixed race 

Don't know why he 's a half-caste

I don't understand the problem

But anyway

Anyway one that 's a nice coffee colour

Because half-caste suggests half

not quite right

I think person of mixed

I actually agree with Mary Jane

Well whatever

he 's a person of mixed race and he 's a rather nice colour 

But was it the colour or the or the build

Both

Absolutely both

He looked

he

I mean that this is the thing when I ask you to describe the build and you mentioned the rounders bat

I mean I meant of the entire body rather than just of the rounders bat

No I was just saying who d who who did you mean

You know

No

Actually he w he he looked like a polished

And what kind of body would you like

Well about nine inches

No no no no no

I was just saying that checking who you meant

You know he looked like a polished conker

He was really He was shiny and absolutely smooth

Not a hair

Uhm

Yes that body

Not a hair

You don't like hairs

Not on his chest no

Absolutely smooth everywhere 

Oh he had the best skin

No 

No

But do you not like hairs in general

Oh isn't that interesting

I do

No I don't

No but he had the biggest muscles and the smoothest skin in the world

So yes

Body

Nick body

Absolutely definitely

Without a doubt

Nick

And Billy 's money

Yes I was just about to say

Nick body Billy 's Ferrari  Billy 's racehorses Billy 's bank balance

Billy don't be a hero

Yes

Not Billy 's bald head

God I 'm frozen

I must go and get a cardigan

And uhm

Are you cold

Well I 'm a bit chilly

Whose mind

I 'm bloody frozen

Whose mind

Whose mind

Murray 's

Murray 's mind

Yeah

Ah

Nick 's body Billy 's money Murray 's mind 

Yes

Oh Murray 's so sweet

He rang me up when uhm  yeah he rang me up when uh Julie was away and we had a chat

Oh he was so funny

He said I mean you know all the emotional problems that Julie 's had I mean and is still having

Up in the middle of the night

hallucinations you know

nightmares

screaming

Is she still having hallucinations

Basically the works yes

She 's still She 's still got big problems

Anyway the joke is Murray got a cold

After three years of this Murray got a cold and and went to bed for two hours because he was feeling awful

and Julie was going around saying you bloody men you hypochondriacs and they the least thing and you 're b taking to your bed and blah blah blah

and Julie said Murray said it was just great

After two years you know of of being woken up at all hours of the night

Nurt Waiting on her nursing her you know

I have a cold and go to bed and I 'm accused of being bloody men you know

The least thing

Oh poor lamb

So I said to come down here Murray and I 'll stroke your back

Given half a chance

Oh bless him





No we don't we don't do groups there

We do groups at uhm Kettering

We do but we do very small versions

We do we do them mainly at Chandos  which is the  the ghastly Jewish club  



Oh yes I mean it is nice there

well the actual setting 's nice but what 's ghastly about it is it 's run by fogeys

It 's even worse than Angela 's if you can imagine 

I just got

I just can't stand to confront them recently for no particular reason

but there is such a ghastly atmosphere when there 's

oh

It 's run by sort of octogenarian  Jewish fogeys who are like sort of very morose 

And everyone walks in you know

it 's that sort of atmosphere

You walk into a room  and it 's really intense antagonism

You know everyone just goes I want to get out of there 

Any any place that 's dominated by one kind of  type of person or kind of mentality  is very repressive  particularly when the sort of governing sides of it the management are are all of a kind  same generation and same attitude and

and

But apart from that it 's lovely

There 's a lovely setting 

I mean on a day like this it 's magnificent and there 're some really nice people there



Where 's the sh whesh





Splendid

yeah we did

Yeah I mean it 's much freer than North North Northway in a way it 's much more open so you when it 's a nice day you really feel you don't feel close to the other courts either  whereas Northway is always up against everyone a bit

That 's the only disadvantage

It 's slightly closed the closed the courts are closed in on each other



I think they are in every tennis club

I mean there 's no tennis club doesn't have a kind of pecking order  and the kind of you won't play with me cos I 'm not good enough and that sort of team  rivalry and uh most intensely felt and seen by the ladies 

I mean

There is in fact this lady

I mean

ladies in groups are just phenomenally difficult  to cope with unless you get them and syphon them off into areas

and you don't because this lady actually a marvellous woman called Pepys Elizabeth Pepys

she used to actually have lessons at Northway



Uhm



Pepys



She 's a she 's a doctor in fact and deals in aller some sort of allergy  specialises in allergies or something

and her husband 's a very very bright professor

and they all went they 've all gone to Trinity Cambridge  all of them and the son and the daughter who are very who are orthodox orthodox the kids

but the parents aren't

And she she 's organised

she 's rung around

She actually plays for the second team  sorry

You 'll never get a word in with me talking

You were

Well you were asking me what I was doing today



Yeah what were you doing today

I was in Narrow Wood which is just near Box Hill Dorking

Yeah yeah uh I 've been to Box Hill

This place called Narrow Wood which is an educa

Narrow Wood

Yeah

Yeah

It 's an educational site 

but it was an open day today

so there were lots of kids streaming in and out

and 

We were l lowering a dipping platform  so the younger kids can sort of watch fish fishnets and sort of have a look and see what 's in the ponds 

Yeah

It 's for that uh uh uh

In what group was that the

What group do you are you a part of 

Kingston Conservation Volunteers

Oh yeah yeah so

So yeah we 're going back there

That 's not strictly con conservation

is it

It 's it 's to do with recreation recreation more than

Not really

Well we 're more used to planting trees and chopping them down and hu hurdling

Yeah

But we 're actually going back there in May to actually make a dipping platform  so

Yeah



Temporary one

Well it 's one they can plant themselves onto fishnets

Yes

It 's when you

Platform in a pond really just to a sort of walkway for kids to look up close because they 're always taking parties of kids around to have a look at the site 

It 's you know it 's a nature reserve

you know it 's yes

Walks

 yeah yeah

Yeah

Have you been there before

you 're

you 're familiar with that particular

 yes

Yeah I 've been there  about three times before

Yeah



How many what

Oh commons yeah yeah

Yes

I work all around sort of Surrey Leatherhead area



That 's a nice area isn't it Leatherhead

I know that very well 

Yeah we go to  Park

we do all different kinds of ones this winter



Mmm

Yeah  up to Dorking

From Leatherhead up to Dorking that area

Yeah we go back  you know when we 're needed you know

My friend Alice who lives opposite  she organises the task

She rings up the wardens  and says you know

Yeah

So you got involved through her

did you

No I she got involved through me

Ah 

My ex-boyfriend Phil he got me interested

I went out  one

It was December the thirty-first nineteen eighty-nine and I really enjoyed it and then Alice came out on my second task and she 's loved it

What happened before that

Good fun 

Very

Keeps you fit though

You got 



No I mean Phil

 Phil fell over on wild ponds and dipping ponds







Yes  yeah

We we are good friends but he 's having a few problems with his girlfriend new girlfriend

I 'm going to try and contact him tomorrow at work see how he is





oh I see

So I mean she came in as sort of while you were around  type of thing or

And I wouldn't have him back

No I mean we had split up and then  she sort of came in couple of months later

Oh

Have you met her



Did she



In Muswell Hill

How how did she do that  

Well he goes up to North London anyhow to go to this therapy group  uhm and she lives up in North London

She lives in Hornsey  poor girl uhm 

Yeah

Yeah



Well 

not the bits where I was working in  pum the pumping station



It 's horrible and filthy and horr

I didn't like it at all

But  she started talking to Phil

Yeah  and it sort of happened from then 

But she 's really nice though



With Phil

 no not with Phil

Conserving Phil 's  well libido

No



Libido







I was doing

I was doing hedgelaying 

It was the week before last



Are you off work at present 

You 're not working

I am working

But you just took the time off

Yeah

So this is your job



Uh yeah

You were on holiday

I do

I do go on working holidays



Yeah

You get to meet different people of all ages  see a bit of English countryside and do what I do

Yeah well it 's very good because it 's very difficult to meet people in London

isn't it

I mean

just by  your sort of normal sort of  channels it 's very difficult to actually get into conversations that that may lead to something a bit more interesting  whereas if you actually take up a some kind of activity where you 're sharing something with someone then you tend to talk more naturally and you get to know people better

Mmm

Yeah well there are a lot of kinds of people 



So you can't follow and pursue it yeah



Yeah

But you don't actually have a rapport with people at work

do you necessarily

No

No so I mean 

I mean they are nice at work but I mean I tend to keep work and 

Yeah

Play separately

Uhm

Mind you hopefully they 'll be coming to my birthday party

but I did ask a few people I did ask a few people at work to my birthday party so

When is that

Second of May

You 're having it here 

At a friend 's house in Kew  with Alice

We 're having a joint birthday party

Is her birthday round the same time

Sixth

It 's a good idea actually that isn't it because it means you don't all  spread out a bit more

Yeah and it won't be so

We were trying to have a hall 

but it turned out to be too expensive or fully booked up

and we were having so many problems trying to get through to people

and it 's just

My  friend Clare said

yeah

sure

she 's got a big house so we 're taking it over kind of thing





Kew Bridge is it

Well yeah 



Yeah

D' you know the Mortlake Road

Yeah

She lives on there

Ah

No it 's a really nice house  



Are you are you going you getting out there





Ch Christmas time

Anyway

Are you insisting on this



Yeah 

Well we 're going to have a fa family do actually on the day



What are you what are you going to do

Uh





So in fact just having a dinner party  with all the fa with your family and a few friends yeah



Yeah

No

not just family because I 'll be seeing all the friends on apart from one on

yeah

Family

On at the party

How many do you think will come turn up

Well I don't know

I 've invited quite a lot but I 've kind of lost count 

About four people in my conservation group can't come 

One 's going to Paris

He 's cycling to Paris  very keen cycling jogger and another one 's going on a field trip for work  another 's travelling for a month

He goes on Thursday

He 's going all round Italy Austria Switzerland all over the place inter rail  so

And one person 's allergic to my friend 's dog

She 's he 's allergic to dogs or cats you know

just brings him up sneezing  the dust and

you know

shame really

Yeah





No but the smell even the smell of Lucy would probably attract uhm 

Can't farm poor Lucy out 

I mean she 's going to have the time of her life

Why do not you



Yes it is going to be sixties gear

Oh dear

Cos Alice and I were both born in sixty-two so

Well sixties is popular I mean if people can find out find anything



Oh yeah

We went to a sixties party two years ago I think it was for a friend of ours and it was a great success

I mean I have still got well

Do you get a tape of all the music and stuff

Yeah I have got lots of people bringing tapes

I have got Rob doing  tapes

and I am doing some

and Sue and Gerry

What sort of food do you get

Do you get try and get anything typical

No we are





There must have been something that was



Hamburger time

or I dunno don't know

or no

that was later







Oh I see so

Yes yes

Yes

Oh

Oh yeah

Meat

Oh oh yes yes

Yes



But there is a lot of meat still basically

A lot of meat

Well we will have dips and crisps and things like that but we are also having

Clare makes a mean chilli so we will have that

I am also probably going to do a vegetarian dish

I am going to have a look in the wholefood cookbook and see what they have got 

Uhm

Alice is on a has got a few ideas

and  we will go to a cash and carry place and get try and get a lot of the ingredients cos my friend Karen her father has got a cash and carry card

so if we do that we will get wine and beer cheap

and 

Much cheaper is it

Probably if you buy in bulk

Yeah



And people bring a bottle anyhow but  things like beer and

When we go to a cash and carry there is they have got small

uhm

Things like crisps and things like that

So shall I tell you about this conversation

I mean I didn't 

I wrote it down sort of uh after I 'd had the conversation obviously

but it was a few days after when I decided that this was really what I would talk about 

and it 's a conversation with uhm Paul who is the coordinator of the O D P school where I teach 

And I teach there on a

What 's an O D P school

Well they 're operating department practitioners and they 're people who uhm work within the operating theatres of hospitals

And the school where I teach is uh it 's at the general hospital in Northampton 

So the students come in from all over

You know from the whole area 

But I do I suppose you 'd call it freelance teaching there

So I 'm not a full-time lecturer there and I just go in to teach the science

So therefore when I speak to him it 's partly social contact

I always try to analyse this

It was partly social  and it 's partly I realised when I thought about it so that I can gain a certain amount of information from him about what 's happening with the course what 's happening about other lecturers

You know

How things are being organised about future developments because communication really is dreadful within the hospital

I just don't find out anything until it 's happened or all signed and sealed

And they sort of said

Oh didn't you know

Yes

You may be left out of it because you are a freelancer

So you have make a social effort when you come around

So that sort

That 's right because you know I mean it would be easy to go in and lecture and come out again

but I usually try to make sure that I do see him before I come away 

So it 's social contact fir first of all and to give him a chance to impart his information 

Uhm I said that yes we never have any staff meetings

So as I say communication is diabolical there and he and the hierarchy sort of decide on everything and the lecturers do as they 're instructed 

Yeah

He gets feedback also from the students as to what the lecturer 's done and I think this is how he checks on his lecturers

I don't think he 's ever asked me what I was doing 

I mean I have a syllabus you know but uh he never asks me what I am doing uh but I persist in informing him you know what I 've done 

So one of the aims is for me to acquire information  and to make certain of dates and future plans  and also to tune into problems and the general mood and pick up on any moans and groans which otherwise sort of rumble under the surface

and this way I can usually discover proposed future programmes all long before I 'd officially be told 

So therefore I think I need to be subtle and understanding of all his problems 

and I tend to put my own point of view uhm usually in a way which assumes that I 'm merely pointing out what he already knew  you know because I found this works best

If I sort of say oh I assume you realise that so and so and so and so and he said oh yes

and I can tell by the look in his eyes that he didn't actually but he then makes a mental note to do something about it 

So I start off this conversation after we sort of had a bit of social niceties you know like How 's the wife you know How 're things going

and then I say well next week is a full week 's block teaching isn't it Paul

That means I teach every day next week

and he says yes yes that 's right

You 're in every day

Uhm so I check whether then whether the students are doing their exam before after or during my lecture which I never otherwise would know until I arrived on Monday and uhm  also proving at the point the point that I have in fact thought about this 

I 'm not just going to go and do it off the top of my head 

So I also say to him I assume that you 've reorganised one of my lectures for Tuesday because I assume you realise that at the moment on the timetable I 'm supposed to lecture to two groups of people at exactly the same time

And he says oh really and uh he obviously hadn't realised

So he puts this right and I sort of stand by while he sort of uhm reorganises another lecturer to sort of that we can swap over

I can do consecutive lectures 

So obviously this chap was vital you know

Otherwise there would 've been two groups sitting there waiting for me to lecture on Tuesday 

Uhm well then I suppose having done this now it 's his chance to have a moan

and I always give him a chance to do it because I think he feels he can do so to me because being freelance I 'm neither attached to the hospital or part of the college either 

So he can sort of have a good old moan about anything he feels like

So he moans about money  and the fact that the college haven't yet billed him for my services and if they don't do it before April they won't get the money anyway

So this is nothing to do with me anyway

so I just sympathise because I need the job and I sort of try to keep him happy 

So uhm I keep on the right side of him basically by sort of agreeing with all this and saying how disgusting it all is

And then he 's he 's at the moment ordering two thousand pounds worth of new equipment to refurbish the suite of rooms  that the O D A School has just been asked to move into 

And this is all so that the finance department can move into the place where we already are 

But this isn't definite

but he 's already spent the money  because he says well if they 're willing to give away that much he 's not going to wait for them to change their minds

So he spent it

And I 'm sort of at the same time thinking philosophical thoughts about  wasted money and hospital waiting lists and things

and uh but I don't say anything because I 'm a real worm and I 'm sort of saying

I don't blame you Paul

Why not something or

You know socially slushy

So that 's about it really because then I sort of uh make my exit you know with encouraging noises hopefully to retain my job 

But as I say I started off analysing it and discovered in the end it sort of defied total analysis  but most of my conversations with him seem to follow that sort of route which is why I chose it

I 'm sorry 

But as a piece of communication it was very successful

Yes I thought so

Because without without that conversation having taken place as you said there would 've been two classes sitting waiting for you

So there 'd there 've been some some areas in the time table thing that had to be brought to his attention

Yes

They both start uhm similar to mine

Mine had a corporate build-up

It 's material outcomes you 're going in to to get

Yes

You know and

 that terminology

you have a an objective you know

So what was yours

My 

Mine

Mine

I had to install an adult education class in old time dancing in an unfamiliar space 

They normally have this class adult education class where I work

We had a B B C camera crew in so they had to install these pensioners  they weren't used to

Uhm and uhm communication with two people

One was the tutor of the class uhm who I don't know very well I maybe met a couple of times before but we haven't got a relationship uhm to speak of and

but she has a reputation for being difficult

Uhm and so you know  the sort of person for whom if you said I 'm afraid that there 's no you know we 're running out of tea bags or something you know something 's always going to hitch

always something with her class 

So actually transporting them to another building could be perceived to be a problem

Uhm

So you 've got twenty odd pension pensioners

I mean she 's representative and uh and the course has twenty odd pensioners

Uhm and there 's uh my colleague who 's a pensioners ' worker who isn't doing this job but who has a long relationship who has told me  this woman

and I have got the job  for some reason

I don't know why she isn't doing

I haven't quite worked that out

Uhm what I could go straight on to is is that is basically I looked at I did I just did a matrix a matrix of uhm  status

If you 're if you 're  in status relationships  which comes from old acting exercises where you can adopt personal status between one and ten

One is low status and ten is high status

and you go onto the scene and then someone else comes in one to ten and the dramatic dynamic is when you meet

Uhm so you could have two very low status people like both at one  uhm and it 's not as  simple as social status or

It 's a psychological thing

You can be very high status

You know silence is very often high status

so you can have somebody who 's who 's a king extremely wealthy because he has lots of money and are brought down to earth by  you know the poorest person in the community by virtue of  their psychological power in the context of the scene

So what I did was I gave them status relationships as the kind of key currency 

Uhm so down one one side of the matrix is the different relationships me and Vi the tutor me and Sheila my colleague and Sheila and Vi

and then the other the other bits are three incidents

So you see the statuses change over time  through that episode

So the first bit of the episode is is when she came into the hall and I 'd been there an hour 

OK

And I had a bit of a status advantage over Vi because I 'd cleared all the tables and all that and I 'd gotten up

Cos I 'd I 'd seen that there 'd be problems

and I 'd actually gone ahead to the hall and it wasn't ready and I got it ready

So

So

And I started off

Mm

Yeah

Yeah

Oh

Brilliant

Right

Mm

Right

Right

Right

Yeah

Mhm

Yeah

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm

Yes

Yeah

 started off

When I say I started off

Oh she started off slightly ahead of me because there were still a few tables I hadn't cleared away yet uhm uh and so she caught me unawares

That was all right 

Uhm so that worked through

I mean I can just go through go through that that sector and then sort of the the next section until she was installed was plugging in her record player and the plug didn't work  and I 'm not mechanically-minded

I 'm going like this

Screwdrivers

Right

My status dropped 

Have I put that

I think I might have got these the wrong way round that I got high status and she got lower status

Oh no by the end of that episode I 'd I 'd achieved it and charmed her

I 'm just looking up when I played Mishin Ma  which was uh  sixth of March

What 's today

Yeah

Today is the tenth

So just a month ago 

and she beat me four six 

and the second set which she didn't want to play I won three two

Didn't want to play a second set

Aaah 

That 's right yeah 

Today  I beat her six four  and then there 's the second set we didn't complete because she didn't want to

three one

Three one yeah

So that 's interesting 

Previously a few months previous  before that  uhm  we had one set and I beat her six one

Yeah

Yeah

You turned it round then didn't you

I turned it round today  and done did one better because it was three  one not three two

Mmm

Yeah oh right 

So uh you know 

and uh I 'm doing all that

and I still uh

She 's playing in the set cup 

Yeah I know

So anyway there we are 

It 's going to be real busy next week  cos we 're doing the team practice every day  for the juniors and I 've got uhm work before team practice and I 'm trying to sort out the work after the team practice

Can't play the tournament in the evening  so I 'm going to be really busy

Yeah  well 

How many have you got tomorrow

I 've got four tomorrow now unless somebody rings up and uh wants a lesson

I can put them in at one o'clock 

But uhm 

Mmm

I 'll just write down the score

I suppose I could ring Mercedes and tell her to come at one o'clock tomorrow 

It 's not her turn though 

Her turn is the following week

Will she be two in a row then

No  she said she was coming tomorrow to tell me whether or not she could do the following week

And I said you don't have to come 

you can ring me up 

but she insists that she 's going to come

I said I 'll be busy teaching

I won't be able to talk to you

D' you know I 'll just come when I 'll tell you so she 's doing her bit with uh

Yeah I 'm sure of that

But I could make the time

Carlos

What time does she normally have a lesson

Three

Three o'clock

She might take heart and not ring me at one 

Yeah 

Well you can do it and then uh Ursula can forfeit anyway

Well yes she says it 's her night and I intend to keep her to it because this is her second cancellation

It 's not just the first one 

She cancelled before and went off

Mmm

Not good enough is it

Well  you can't earn a living if they 're going to keep cancelling

I mean they 've got to uh

You give the hours to those that are going to be regulars 

You can't hold hours over for people who are going to mess about

Well

Well they won't learn anything if they mess about will they

No  well of course

but what I 'm saying is that if it 's convenient for them to book a lesson and then  if it 's nice they want to go out and do something else and then even maybe have a lesson next week after  

You can't do that

I mean you aren't going to honestly give any priority to them

You just fill them in when you  fit them in when you 've got a space

Mmm

When the sun shines off they go

Yeah

Well they

Yeah  well she 's actually paid four lessons in advance  Ursula but I can't keep putting the lessons forward because I 'm not

It 's just the same

Yeah but I mean it 's

No you can't

You can't have all the trouble cos you spend all your time ringing up the others  to let them know  when you could have done it when you saw her

so she 's costing you you know all the time money cos you have to make all the phone calls to do it

Yes

Yeah

Yeah I think I 'll just keep her to that 

Don't know if I want to teach you know tomorrow

If I teach her tomorrow she may not come next week anyway 

Mind you I wouldn't mind a day

It is though Saturday so it doesn't really matter

Next Saturday yes  but you were talking about tomorrow

Yeah

Yes tomorrow uh  you see Mercedes ' lesson should be next week  Easter Saturday

but she 's not sure if she 's going away or not  or if she 's going to go out or not with Carlos 

so that 's why she 's humming and hawing about next week 

 motorbikes

Cor those motorbikes 

They  they seem to go very low don't they when they turn the corner

Mmm

How 's uhm  this other girl that 's the opera singer

Janice the Wednesday evening one

Has she booked in anywhere yet

Has she booked in yet

No she 's  she 's not really a dancer she uh 

she 's sort of uh 

I think she 'd rather just sing and not bother to move at all

 but the role calls for her to do some moving

so she 's uh come a bit unstuck with that part

So uh I said to her don't leave it until the two weeks before the performance

This is July they 're doing the performance 

but she 'll uh  she 'll ring me up and book on the Wednesday evening nine till ten  uh when she can 

I think it 's the money

She doesn't want to spend too much money on it  because they have all these rehearsals as well that she 's got to attend 

So I suppose that it is a bit late but then  that 's the cheapest of the studio costs otherwise it costs them nearly double you know 

Yeah

Yeah

Well

Very expensive this studio

Uhm  yeah

It 's nearly ten pounds for the hour  for the Wednesday evening for her to book the studio  and that 's the cheapest one yeah

It 'll cost her about fourteen pounds if she does it in the day  and depending on what time of the day

If she does it lunchtime  when they consider that it 's the busy  season sort of thing they 'll charge her fifteen for that room

I don't think that room is worth fifteen an hour  or even seventeen an hour by the time you put V A T on top 

Quite a lot of money for an hour 's lesson

That 's my fee

And that 's cheap

Mmm

No

Why can you not coach every day in half term providing the children have half term at the same time 

And it 's a bank holiday

Monday the twenty-fifth of May is a bank holiday  which is half term so we don't have Monday Tuesday classes 

Practically all the children that uh I coach will be off  that week and I can do Monday to Friday

No

Well this is it

They had

And then I shall go off on the Sunday 

Back on the Wednesday

We 're into June then 

And in June there are four matches  four  club team matches

that 's going to be hard because they start six thirty  finish nine 

Some are away and some are home matches

The away ones are are so different

They 're less tiring 

So if I have any of my own matches plus team matches it 's going to be very very busy  in June and June is going to be the busy time for coaching

 July

There 's been one match in July for the team  and well as soon as you hit July the children start to go away again

Yeah

You could even 

Yeah

Yeah well they all start going on holiday don't they

So it 's uh you know  it 's a bit of an inconvenience 

Yeah I don't know how July will is going to hit my classes  on the Saturday

Some people go away  but uhm last year I think I had quite a lot you know

I was full up last year 

I 'm full up now until June

I 'm looking at June for bookings

Well I don't have to look

I just continue what I 've got really  uhm and I can fill up the uh  Saturday private teaching  five hours every every Saturday  uh until we go to Aberdeen  really

I just continue them but I 'm trying to fit in these new ones that keep ringing up wanting lessons 

It 's difficult to fit them in because I haven't got enough hours   in the day to put them in 

Unless I start teaching at midnight 



Mmm

Mmm

Yeah

Mmm

Yes well and I expect they 'd say yes too

 They 'd say yes

If they come from nine to ten  they 'll come from ten to eleven wouldn't they

Yeah

But the studio 's not open then 

I doubt whether the  the little hall over the church would let me teach at midnight

Mmm

I 've got to buy some more balls  for coaching

Continuous expense isn't it

But uh I just spent I just spent for two dozen 

Can't you go fishing in the lake

No mmm

I I 've got some here but it won't be enough and uh  I don't know uh I

I looked in the ball hop today and it was half full 

Uh I don't know where the balls go

Other people must have picked them up then and put them in their ball hops

Yeah well it 's  and keep disappearing 

I 've just paid off the two dozen

I only owe for a dozen now

I 'm going to buy another two so I 'll be owing for three dozen and back to square one again

I 'll never get it  straight

Uhm 

Oh well I ought to ring Pat  and Robin and get them down here

Get them going yeah

Booked in

Yeah keep them going because if they they 'll go off the boil if you don't 

I don't really want to do that

I 'll miss out that ten o'clock

Since I 've got a match on Sunday at three  I could miss out the ten o'clock lesson because I 've got three hours 

I 've got four tomorrow so and the match is at three 

That 's I mean I could do Pat and Robin but that 's a hard lesson with those two  and uh I can put them in during the week  

Mmm

Mmm

Uhm

Mmm 

Will I give Mercedes a ring 

Mmm why not

I could put her in tomorrow at three  at uh one o'clock  and then uh  try and get her to come next week as well 

I doubt whether she would

She might do that 

Sometimes she does that 

And then uhm  we 'll see if she messes around after that 

Can't keep her going 

I can find her at home then 

Book 

Do you speak with her in French

No I speak to her in English

Well it takes a while to 

OK  for a minute I thought it wasn't 

All that conversation for nothing

Uhm  Mercedes























OK she can come  

She thought about it for a little while 



Yeah 

Well it 's her lunch

She uh  doesn't like missing her lunch

Mmm



Mmm 

I wonder if they 've gone out 

Commiserations to Pat and Robin 

They 're Labour

Labour lost

Commiserations

Oh that 's right

Ah it 's the machine 

Maybe they 've just gone away 

Cos conversation was like  entertainment whereas now it 's  a means of exchanging information

Well it was that as well but I mean there was no T V

there was no no book

well books there were books but there were no magazines no newspapers no 

Would you

Weren't as many

There 's not really so much made of like of uhm famous conversationalists 

Yeah

Like Oscar Wilde

Wasn't he famous for being a an amazing conversationalist

Right

And now they have a they have like those competitions

don't they

conversationalists

And they 're always on like s uh Six O'Clock Live and things

and that 's about as far as it gets just  sort of thing yeah

That sort of thing yeah

Uh that 's probably why it was I suppose

People talked more 

But I mean I I don't know

I talk a lot

Uhm

Yeah but 

I mean with telephones we do talk more

I mean we should be doing

Telephones are really weird

Cos I 've listened to a just a couple of them that we 've done

and it 's very really really short and there 's loads of little sentences

It 's all oh yeah right and there 's  and you get lots of uhms and yeahs

You get that a lot in conversation anyway but

Suppose so

Cos there 's so much is done on  your face and body language and

Right

Yeah cos I 'm listening to you know you know we 're listening to each other cos we 're looking and stuff but on the telephone you can't see them

so it 's like  have you been cut off sort of thing you know I suppose uhm

But they 're quite good cos you can always tell the difference between them cos one person 's voice you know

It 's like on the  films

It just doesn't make much sense to me at all  that if illiteracy is down you 'd think that more people would use   and yet they don't

It just seems that almost as soon as  somebody leaves college they revert back to the most simplistic way of communicating 

I don't mean to sound patronising but it 's I mean that 's what I do

As soon as I 'm out of

What do you mean

Yeah

No no but uh

Well I 've read about three books since I finished my degree  so  which is terrible and I get really guilty about it but I don't want to

And you get out of the habit of reading as well

Yeah it 's ridicul ridiculous

Everything 's so strange because the whole course is the English course is supposed to teach you how to be more articulate

I mean I think this is presumably more articulate more precise and more  and  be able to communicate more 

And

And be able to read things

And be able to see the right things in the things you 're reading yeah

Still you 're still reading but you 're seeing more

Yeah that 's the

You know we were saying what 's the point earlier on 

I suppose that 's the point but I mean  yeah I wasn't the most model student like I was saying earlier on

I wasn't exactly the most model student here anyway so

I 'm not and what annoys me is that I read  I 've always read but I 've always been a sort of an addicted reader

I can read books

I can read sort of four books in a day if I want to

I could be that intense about it which was not the right word to use

but in s as soon as I get into a conversation  the vocabulary that I know I must know and do know is back there somewhere

I just don't use any of it

It doesn't come forth as it were

Uhm

Yeah it depends what vocabulary  the person you 're talking to uses as well

You kind of you find a common

Uh you do though don't don't you think

I don't know

That 's true

You cha I think you change the way you speak

Yeah I 've look looked at my dad when he talks to the guy who does his car 

I mean he doesn't mean to do it and he 's not being patronising

He goes y starts saying yeah yeah right oh right I see whereas my dad wouldn't talk like that

That 's mimetic behaviour isn't it

Or I think it 's or i or it 's some I don't know some strange desire to make the other person feel comfortable  in the sense that if you  if you converse on the same level n neither one 's going to feel out of place or strange or going to feel more at home and therefore be able to communicate better

I don't know

What 's that

Oh mimetic

Yeah

Uhm

Uhm

But you know a few people in this department I definitely find my style of speech changes dramatically because they use a  more extensive vocabulary

I 'm therefore put into a position to try and bring out some new words and to express myself well and start speaking you know be to the point and

Yeah

I always used to like

I remember sitting I was in here once and there were some people talking about what was that film 

Dead Poets Society  by Robin Williams 

I just love doing things like them

I could hear them talking and I was sort of vaguely in the conversation

I hadn't said anything

They were saying about oh wow oh I just thought

I hated it because like it brought art down to the common level

and I was just going I just felt like saying well was there a lot of sex in it just to really annoy them you know 

Make them uh 

 get the most pretentious conversations happening really 

Where

Here

Here

Right here 

I had a good one on Monday night

Cos I had to record a conversation and later on  after several bottles of wine  we suddenly got onto religion argh 

There 's a subject

When you 're drunk it 's not

And that was that was deep you know

Uhm

Certainly wasn't

Religion is about the only controversial seb subject we have left today

It 's the only thing people can't prove anything  definitely about

Yeah

It 's not controversial when I talk about it

It 's just  if you disagree you disagree you know

I believe in God

I don't

OK

Yeah but

But there 's a lot of people you get who who won't accept that aren't willing to argue

Oh yeah

They knock on your door on Saturday mornings and get you out of bed and say do you want to buy our pamphlet yeah

But don't you think like you know 

I 've got a a friend who  whose parents are Catholic

Now he 's not a practising Catholic as far as I know and he never talks about it but if it the subject comes up and especially if he 's had a couple of drinks he gets absolutely irate about it

Gets offended if you  yeah

I know I know couple of people like that

Very offended

You 'd think he

Criticise the Church at all I mean the Catholic Church that is

Yeah

It 's in sort of inbred defence sort of

Mm mmm or

I don't know 

Cos a lot of people get very arrogant about their own religions

You know this must be

This is right

It 's well you can understand it because if it 's part of your faith then you have to believe that  but it 's

Yeah

If you believe you can yeah

If it 's faith then you can't do a lot about it 

And people can't pr as I said people can't prove anything about it 

It 's not something that can be really analysed because no one really knows 

No one can know

I always

No of course not

I always wonder uhm  whether people are better off with faith or without or well with faith

whether they 've got something that I haven't 

I don't think so but I just wonder you know if they 're happier

They 'd have to be

It really depends on the personality because it

They need something to believe in

What was that I heard about 

I mean i if you have inner strength to cope with n and the way you cope is base basically you 're coping with your external pressures

Now if you haven't got the inner strength to do that sometimes you need help and I think a lot of people turn to that 

It 's like a security blanket you know

I mean that 's  reducing it I think a little bit but uhm  but then we can't know

We might die and then find ourselves going straight down 

Yeah

Yeah

Well that 's the way I see it

Yeah

There 's a lovely thought

That 's why I 've g I 've got a friend who 's an atheist 

She 's doing theology at Oxford and

she 's an atheist

but she wants to convert to be a Catholic because she wants to be on the safe side so that if she dies and she 's been wrong then she goes then she 's safe and goes up to Heaven  which is

Does it work like that

I don't think so

One way of doing it

That 's what her family was trying to say

 they really don't think that 's going to work like that and she said no no it 's going to be great you know

I 'll go through life not believing in God and then on the death bed I can say now I was only joking

I really do love you God

Ah God knows these things

Yeah

And the priest will come bless me and then I 'll be fine

Yeah

We had a priest like that kind of

I was a Catholic

brought up a Catholic

Catholic school 

And uh you know like in James in Portrait of the Artist yeah

We had one a bit like that

He wasn't quite as bad as that but he was very did all the fire and brimstone sermons every now and then 

He was a bastard actually 

He he he was made head of punishments

That was his his title

My God 

Mmm

That would look great on your C V

Yeah head of punishments

Or if wanted to be a prison officer for instance but that can't think of anything else that would be a particular 

Yeah and so strange the things that people  about religion  for something that 's supposed to make you  behave well to the people around you treat them with respect and dignity and caring and kindness

You get so many violent characters

Or a priest

Yeah

That 's not the reason that you treat people well though is it cos you 're scared to go to Hell 

Well for some people it is

It doesn't seem quite correct

Well nearly all so much religion works on fear

It does

It 's compulsion

Yeah

Read the Book of Revelations

Woah 

I mean talk about terrifying people 

Sit down

Have you read all the Roman plays yet

Yeah

 them all

No Shakespeare

Oh he depresses me so much 

He really does

 

He just really scared me about my my moderns two essay as well

Why

Because uhm I told him



Yeah because uhm he said to me  he said to me like when I told him I was going to do it

And I said well I really want to get it finished by Christmas

I 've got so much history of art to do  and uhm

Got the 

Mm mmm

And uhm so I 'm meant to be finished by Christmas

Came to January

Oh really want it finished by February definitely 

And uhm  and uhm then it was like he goes right well have you finished it

No

Have you written the first draft

No 

And uhm it 's like so you must have done all the research then 

No 

Do you know I thought

I was I mean and then I started lying cos he got me dead scared 

I don't know

Almost thought it was such a

Just don't know where to stop so

No

Is th is that what they expect you 've done a first draft by now

He think he thinks like I should have finished it by now

First draft of what

Moderns two essay

Did you ever do a course essay

Oh I mean oh I didn't do one 

When 's it due in

May

First of May which is actually

First

The first

It 's it 's the second Monday that we get back from Easter holiday

Well I wasn't an awful teenager

I 'm sorry I was a nice teenager

What

don't you think awful and you you were on that tape we played  saying gays are disgusting and they should all be executed

All these thoughts come out

You were being hilarious

What was it R Ri

Richard was saying because you were going can't get a girlfriend I can't get a girlfriend

I 'll probably end up like that guy at Embankment sta tube station

You were going oh no oh

You know tight skin jeans that went choo choo don't you think

Why why

A matter of opinion

I don't remember anything of you 're talking about

You don't remember it

You were talking about this guy at Embankment tube station who stood there in in skintight jeans

and  he was apparently he was really extremely gay

and you were going he apparently he was g he would uhm  say choo choo choo choo or something 

I haven't the faintest idea what you 're talking about

Well you have to listen to the tape then 

Anyway you were both really funny cos you were  both sort of typical teenagers being absolutely  disgusted by the very idea of any sort of perversion in that way

And then oh that 's right

And then there 's the really sweet conversation where you go do you know Jacqueline

He goes yeah 

Cor she smells I mean like really nice

And there 's this one particular smell

and he 's going  well what is it

Don't know but there 's this one particular smell

And she smells like lots of things right 

but there 's this one particular smell where she

It 's really really nice

And he 's going well what is it

Dunno don't know but it 's really nice this one particular smell

And it 's like this smell that 's like really great

It was really sweet 

Who was saying that

Can I have a yellow 

Who was saying that

You were 

Going on about how nice Jacqueline smells  and Richard was saying how he was going to turn out like the guy on Embankment tube station

You have to listen to it 

No I don't 

All teenagers are awful at some point

No they 're not 

All all people are awful at some point

All adults all old age pensioners all children everybody

All animals are awful at some point

So you were saying things like that

it 's like

three-or-four-words

Don't you have remember ever

Kate are you listening

Yeah yeah 

Trying to blame the problems of the world on teenagers

I 'm not

I 'm just saying that

They 're not the ones that cause them 

they 're the ones that try and change them

Hey you know

Excuse me did I say teenagers were responsible for a world war and  for the destitution and famine and any any problems that we have now

I 'm just saying that

Don't be ridiculous

You would do if you were given the opportunity

Oh look at the charmer 

He 's such a winder-upper 

But it 's true

But don't you remember your parents saying to you something like you know when are you going to do your homework and you saying oh for God 's sake and stomping up the stairs and thinking you 're the hardest done-by person in the world

No 

Oh

The way you

You were obviously an exception and you never

You were a perfect child and perfect teenager perfect adult

Lucky you 

Thank you 

What are you doing

I 'm getting the pieces together 

I see

How many are

What

You 're just being very fastidious about it 

How are we going to have room to play uhm 

Shouldn't we have a sort of a forfeit or something 

Where are we going to play

On the floor  only place in this room where we both can sit down 

That 's not true

No but your room is the E E C mountain of dust 

I mean it 's amazing 

Really nice room though 

I like the curtains 

I 'm going to write wash me on everything

No don't please 

Or how about dust me 

Set me free from the mountains of dust

No I don't think so

It works doesn't it

Yes 

Right look

there 's nothing wrong with a bit of dust

It 's uhm no worse than what we breathe in every day  on the street 

You know Mum is buying a new car with uhm for diesel  which has no lead in it at all 

so she 's finally turned green

you 'll be very pleased to hear after talking about lead

Diesel petrol has other pollutants Kate which are just as dangerous 

So the best one is lead free 

What 's it called

Unleaded 

Lead free 

Well she 's trying to be green 

Well that 's not the right way to go about it

Oh well I 'll tell her to get a new bike then 

Don't know how I 'm going to get one

Why don't you buy a rickshaw

A what

A rickshaw 

John can run around

Now I can show my ignorance

What 's a rickshaw

I thought it was a form of haystack

At least that 's what it sounds like

One of those  oriental taxi cabs where you get a chap 

Oh with a bicycle bit

Oh right

No no no no 

He pull he pulls them

He runs and holds  the uhm  holds two poles and you sit in the carriage and he runs and pulls it along

Pulls

How very democratic you are 

And who would you suggest would pull this rickshaw 

Me 

Yes

It might do you some good

Those batteries that you gave me lasted an hour 

Good old Australian batteries

Well they were probably old ones then

You didn't think I was going to unload anything worthwhile on you 

Do you want to play cards

Is there anything wrong or are you being just morose or a 

Do you want to play cards

No I thought we were going to play Connect Four 

All right then 

Fun

right games

Take your pieces 

OK yellow 

Yellow sunshine

yellow fun 

Yellow piss 

Well no piss is or rather urine  is more sort of translucent isn't it 

It 's fucking yellow

It really depends 

Sometimes it 's very pale sometimes it 's so orange

Oh I don't really care

Doesn't interest me 

Ready

Now who goes first

Me of course

It 's my game my house 

My dad 's bigger than your dad

Your dad 's not bigger than my dad 

He is if I say he is

My dad 's six foot two so there 

You 've got to you have to get four in a row

is that right 

I can't see it from here

Well sit down on the floor then 

Can't you stand up and hold it 

No I can't 

So  when 's Dan coming round 

I don't know

When he rings 

I mean he 'll ring to say when he 's coming round

Your go

I 'll find out when he rings

How long does his show run for 

Months 

Four or something

Did he miss her 

I don't think so 

Natalie 's moving out of the flat

Why 

Why

Yeah

Cos she 's got somewhere else to live

Didn't she like it where she was 

No she 's just got somewhere else to live

I don't know why she 's going

She just is

Well how can they keep up with the rent without two extra people

They 'll have to find

Well I think it 's fully paid up

Oh right

Michelle 's paid it 

What about Natalie 

Does he have to find an extra person then

No they 're just going to manage  with the two of them 

Wouldn't they want a third one then 

Yeah Natalie 's a weirdo

She was a  pain in the arse

Well anybody who keeps a whole uhm

She keeps that sort of goldfish jar of cigarette butts in water 

She gave up smoking and then when she started again she kept them

Apparently that 's a pretty good idea

Yeah but she kept it in her bedroom even after she started  started uhm  smoking again 

It was a little bit pointless 

That 's one

That 's one

One nil

Well she probably grew attached to it 

Can't you just see that

Getting attached to a goldfish bowl full of cigarette butts and water

Really lovely

Very cuddly

Will you shut the bottom

Lovely smell 

You go first this time 

Bastard 

In the nicest possible way of course

Well the nicest possible way is the fact that I don't have any  father

Well I do have a father so you can't possibly call me a bastard in the nicest possible way 

can you really

I 'll have to think

What 's wrong with you

Why are you insulting my father 

I what

Why are you insulting my father 

I wasn't

Your father 's a wonderful man

OK 

I revere him and respect him

You worship him

Mmm

I wouldn't say worshipped

I just loved him dearly

Really

Well I can you know  honour him 

Honour him

 

It is your go 

Pardon

It is your go

I know

I 'm just looking for a place to put it 

Not there 

I 'm winning  and that 's the only thing that matters 

Oh crafty 

What

You 're so crafty 

Yeah 

No you 're so thick

God 

Two nil

You 're very insulting 

Pardon

You 're very insulting

You 're being all morose and offensive 

Am I

Don't look stunned at me 

Shocked 

Well which

Right let 's see how many words we can think of beginning with D 

I 'll start

Destitute 

Drug 

Demon

Drink 

Uhm  dyslexic 

Dirigible 

Dirigible 

All right

Dirigible

It 's a sort of balloon  that you fly about in like a zeppelin 

Dinner

Donkey

Or an R one O one

Donkey

It 's your turn 

Dick 

Devil 

Uhm  dick

You did that one

You can't do the same one twice

Drink

Drug

You did all those

Dirigible

You did all those too 

Come on

I can't be the only one who can do it 

If you stick a de in fr in front of something like with dehumanize 

OK I 'll try that 

OK 

Uhm  dehumanize 

Your imagination is

I love it when you work your brain

Uhm  drunk 

That 's a good one 

De-drunk 

Detoxicate

Detoxicate 

Detoxicate 

I don't know if that exists

I don't know if I can let you have that 

All right

Uhm  it does exist

No it doesn't

It does

Disraeli

No it doesn't 

Disraeli 's a proper noun

You can't have that

I said words beginning with D

I didn't say whether they had to be  nouns or

Well you can't have names 

Now who set up this game

Excuse me

Look

it 's a general rule of all word games

Crosswords and Scrabble 

You don't use  well sometimes in crosswords the bad ones

You don't use proper nouns

Disinterested

Oh that 's a good one

It is 

Shut up

You haven't been able to come up with much

Dick twice

I mean Christ almighty 

Uhm damnable 

Dressed 

Well these these are proper words

Shut up

Well so are mine 

Yeah go on

At least they 're interesting 

I love it when you act like a four-year-old

Go on

Depreciate

That 's not a four-year-old word 

That 's a good old thirty-two-year-old stockbroker word

 two-year-old  four-year-old

Uhm  diminished 

But is is it your go or is it my go

It 's my go 

You won 

What

You won

When

Oh 

I didn't even see it

I I left this gaping gap and you put it in and you didn't even notice 

Well I 'm sorry but 

Six one

It is not

Yes it is

It 's two one

Six one

Two one

No cos I get two and a half points for every one that I score  and then plus a bonus of

You are such  a plonker 

No plonker isn't the right word

What does it matter 

What does what matter

What does it matter what the right word is

Bastard

plonker

I mean does it matter

Well

No

All means the same thing 

It means that you 're losing and you can't take it 

And then the fabric 

We thought perhaps that one

No I don't like that

Ah 

No

Right

OK

It 's just got a blue background and the birds and would go well

Yes and the birds

No but it 's too much

Because there 's going to be fabric here 

Don't forget that here

Ah

Fabric here and fabric there

It 's

I I couldn't cope with all those roses

Ah

But but don't forget that here  over the bed 

predominantly what you will see is the lining because the lining we thought would tie in with the bedhead

Uhm

Uhm

Yes

So you will only see a very little of whatever fabric you choose at the sides 

You 're going to have your half tester effect

Yes

Yes

Yes but I I di didn't want you to skimp on the curtains over the bed

No

I don't mind

You

No but it 'll be it 'll be if you decide to have blue it 'll be the blue that you see

Yes

See what I mean 

Uh let me get you a photograph 

It will just be the outside little bit

Really you wouldn't see very much at all  uhm

So what if I chose this wallpaper  uhm what shall we do with this 

Well

Anything anything

You see uhm

I mean i

Just trying to 

I mean how long is the thing 

You see that sort of thing

You join them together with the rosettes  and then you 'd have that above the pictures

And then you could have these tails if you wish

They are nice

Uhm

Yes lots lots of permutations

Look at the odd corners here though 

You see 

I was telling you about that wasn't I 

When you con

Yes

If we tip the swags on their sides

You don't have to have them  uh these swags

you don't have to have them going straight along

You could have it coming down there

Well actually that 's a problem

It would probably work in the corner wouldn't it

Yes

Yes actually

Yes 

So what do you think

Do you think to stick with the blue walls

And this would add just a touch of warmth

Yes I think so

In fact that particular colour it goes quite well here

How does it go with the bedhead

I think it goes very well

What

quite well with the bedhead

Or there if you have the material behind 

It 's quite good isn't it

Uhm

Yes but the material is not going to uh affect the bedhead is it 

Yes it is because it will be stitched

It 'll be behind won't it

Well no because you can choose the the material to match the bed clothes

that 's what I 'm saying

So in fact when you talk about not having too many flowers around you 're going to have something like that in reverse

You 're going to have the main curtain fabric there and there

But the bulk of what you see is going to be the plain fabric on the inside 

Do you see what I mean

Yes

Yes

That 's quite good Brenda

Yes that that 's I always think that 's probably it

That was rather sombre

What

for the blinds

Well yes

The bit behind the bed

Yes yes

Very much like your bedhead

This is what I 'm really saying

The blinds

Yes

Yes it is

Uh it 'll probably be rather nice actually actually trying to match that up 



Uhm

So we have we have thought that we thought you 'd go for that

No I don't like that

Ah it 's a shame

Yeah sorry

Right uhm  That

you see because it 's got the  aspects it 's

No it 's too many roses

Uhm

Uhm

But something like that

That sort of background perhaps but not quite so heavy

This was to just to show you 

We brought this because it was similar to the crinkly that you liked before

Yes there was a crinkly one earlier a sort of palace one I thought

Yes

But really to point out with that really this would not go with anything swaggy because that 's traditional and this is far too modern

So if you wanted bows and things it really looks a clash

No

I think I would prefer with with bows 

A fabric with bows

For curtains

With the curtains yes

But no roses

No

No flowers

No flowers

just bows

I think so  but until I see it I don't know

And you see that that uh s hollyhocks and swags could be too too much couldn't it

I 'm not going t t to 

I 'm thinking if you have the right colours

What about the one that we had for Rosie Francis specially printed  with the bows

I haven't

Have you looked after Sue 

Sue Sue will be quite Sue will be quite happy

She 's very welcome to come in if she wants to

Is sh she settling down somewhere

Can can I just sit on your loo

Now boys go into my son 's bedroom

 yes

Yeah but 



There 's a stool there

Uhm but I do love this idea 

and I think stick sticking with similar wallpaper  and then  pink in this and the pink in the bows o of the fabric

Uhm

Yes

So it 's really just

Uhm

And he will be happy sticking to blue wallpaper won't he

He will be by the time I 've finished with him

Yeah

So it 's written

I mean I can probably get a better blue than that

uh you know

Yes this is more the blue

Yes once I know

Once I 've got it then I can have a look

Yes

Wi could I show this to him

Can you do without this

Until when because we 've got the bank holiday weekend

Yes please do yes

Oh well don't worry

Well I 'll get round it

You might need it on Saturday

I mean it 's an avenue

No no don't worry

it 's an unusual book box so if you can see the sort of permutations

It is lovely

Well this is what I wanted to do because it is a nice room

I wanted to make it special which it certainly isn't at the moment

Yes

Uhm uhm uhm

And I think using that would make it special because it 's unusual

Yes

Yes

And and also this is fairly sort of  you know

Oh y that 's 

isn't it lovely

It 's absolutely lovely

Using that uhm  tha

that 's 

Well  no I don't personally unless we changed the style of the curtains I don't think that the geraldine goes frightfully well with the swags personally 

And I also don't see that there 's any link between between the bit you 're interested

that 's geraldine and



Yes

I I 'd use that

There you see

Too much geraldine in this room

And I think that th

Uh geraldine 

Geraldine in the fabric

 fabric

 yes I wasn't

There there 's no link there 's no link between the white and blue and the geraldine  tha tha

that 's really my problem

No that 's true



Yes

I think we have to be careful with the fabric cos there 's so much of it

I don't want it to shout which I think that does

Well hang on a sec before you say there 's so much of it 

You 're looking at the window

Don you 're the client

now just shut up and listen to me

I don't think there is that much

Uhm

Yes it 's hideous 

To stay here is it

You 're going to you 're not going to draw your curtains

you 're going to have them back as dress curtains

We never draw bedroom curtains

So therefore there isn't going to be that much fabric

Well there is because I like them rather more full than less full

Yes but what I 'm saying is that they 're not going to be covering the windows 

They 're going to be dressed perhaps the way they are 

No

But he would like to draw them  if if sometimes like when it 's snowing

Fine  fine

I mean I 'm not I 'm not talking you into having a fabric

I just wonder whether in your mind you think that there 's going to be more than there actually is because you 're going to have two dress curtains two c two curtains there

Yeah well the point is

If I want them to

If you want them to

But in the main it 's going to be that much fabric that you 're going to be either side

The same at that window  with your uh shaped pelmet 

and the bed is going to be predominantly that that you see with just the fabric on the sides and again across the top

We 're doing a sort of half tester effect I suppose

It 's the same

Because I want double

Showing yes

Yes

What have we decided to do here

Did we decide on an angle

Yes the same the same as that to have dress curtains at the s well have curtains that will draw

Do you think that 's a good idea here 

Here

Ah

But do you see but there 's not a lot of space so we 're going to lose light

But that doesn't matter 

So if we had the cur the pelmet here 

In my experience there 'll be  he can he can fix

Uhm

Right keep going

So the curtains will come like this perhaps caught there and down 

Be rather sort of gracious

Uhm

Well that 's what I 'm after really

 particularly with the table

Yes

Yes



And then I can just I won't have to get rid of this

No no  true true

and it 's

No

Blue

Uh if you want something voiley at the window there are some very pretty voileys 

Uhm

What with some

Very very pale blue would do wouldn't it



Oh yes

Just a very pale blue plain  and dark there 

Uhm

Uhm

Yes so

Or at least you could

Well you could

can you see it

Is there anything else in here

There 's there 's there are

There are bows that go with that

Yes and there 's the a blue wire at the back actually but I 'm not sure of the colour

Are they those that come down 

what do you think

Uhm

Yes yes yes 

 glass

You can perhaps you can uhm 

No that 's not quite the right colour

It 's not far off it 

You can can paint but it hasn't got the 

Hasn't got

It goes with the mat better than that

That 's the green

This is becoming to look greener which is

Uhm it is too

Yes yes it is actually 

But the bows

are they on the next sheet

They have a rosette

Yes

They have bows and then they

They have sort of tails and you can chop them off more or less where you want  if you want them to

In fact you 've got some in your  showroom  with two two or three pictures hanging down with a ribbon in between each one 

Ribbons

Ribbons that

Y

Yes

I have actually above pictures

Yeah

Yes

It 's quite a

No I don't like that here Brenda

Yes I 'm just uhm

Yes you have to be careful what 's available in what colour

Anyway it 's just a routine  general checkup

It 's just just routine yes

All has been well since we last met

Uhm yes

But I think uhm in the bottom  in the front in these two middle teeth in the front there seems to be a bit of a rough edge

Yes

You 're right

I see you 've actually chipped some enamel from this bit

This 

Oh really

It probably needs just a little smoothing down

Yeah

There may be a little bit of tartar build up as well which has cracked off

 so   low levels of tartar which I 'll just clean

Yes we last saw you in July about six months ago

Yeah

I was just saying outside  how these six months go round so rapidly 

A sign sign of the age I know but 

They do yes  yes 

Yes it isn't tartar

You 've just got a very slight uh enamel  chipping there

It just means disking it or sanding

I 'll do that in a minute 

The lowers are fine 

I had that machine running this morning with a previous patient

and uh I didn't realise that there was a a microphone with it as well 

so I 'm not sure I 'd if it 's switched on

I 'm not sure whether we wasted the whole morning  but it hasn't got a  an inbuilt speaker on the machine so the playback won't tell me

I 've got to actually find some phones to plug in

I 've got some at home  so I shall take it home

I wouldn't leave it here over the weekend anyway

It 's a valuable piece of equipment 

There 's nothing wrong Philip  nothing at all

I 'll just disk that little roughness for you and  on your way for six months 

 one last time just for cleaning

Uhm

Right

Yeah

That 's excellent

Very good

I had a clean up

They don't really need a clean this time

They 're better than they have been

Good

Whatever you 've been doing you 've been doing the right thing

Uhm ah yes

I 

They might need a cleaning in a further six months but at the moment they 're  they 're OK 

Yes

Talking about sanding one thinks of Black and Decker paintbrushes

Well you 've got it right in one

It 's the same thing

isn't it

You 've got it right in one

There you are

There 's the Uh  that 's the handpiece  and the  the uh but they just they clip on

They 've got special uh  

What happens is that the the uh the teeth wear to a sort of chiselled edge

and the enamel  is worn down to a very very fine chisel edge

It 's unstable

Unsupported

Because it 's a very crystalline brittle structure  and you just find little bits chip off

Uhm if you leave them chipped and jagged those jagged edges are more likely to get caught in other things and break a bit more off at an awkward angle or even strip a whole side of enamel off 

That 's why this is to smooth them and round them off

Perhaps it 's better if you 

Extraordinary

Just like a Black and Decker

Unsupported

Uhm absolutely

Now you uhm won't actually see any difference

I haven't taken anything off the left

I 've just blunted the chisel if you like

That 's all I 've done

All I 've done is  is I think I 've put a chamfer on at that angle

That 's where the edges were

You often find that the upper front one chisels the outer edge and the lower one chisels the inner edge  because you get that sort of inclined plane action so it  wears that way on this one and and that way on the other one

No no

Precisely

Oh yes

Yes

Uhm

No I can feel the difference all you know straight away

Yup

So

Uhm

Good 

Uhm I suppose it 's the age isn't it

They 're beginning to wear out  wear down 

Good

Steady as you go

That should see you through until

Till July

Yes 

July August

Summer holiday time

I think

uh are you going to have a holiday this year

Oh yes

Well we 're having a holiday

but we 're trying to decide what to do

I think we had a very successful holiday last year doing nothing

You have to

Did you not go away 

So you just stayed at home

No

My daughter 's marriage in in uh Mar uh May last year rather crippled us financially

so and also we hadn't with all the arrangements we had to do for that we didn't uhm really make any plans for a holiday

so we just sort of messed around at home

Went out for a day 

A great success 

Really was a great success

You often sort of pull up your roots and go away in the best part of the summer

and you miss the garden at its best miss all the produce at its best

and uh  so  we thought we might be OK this year cos I 'm sending my son to South Africa 

Got the relatives down in Cape Town

So you actually   as it were

Uhm uhm uhm yes yes

A mad panic before you go and then uh

Has he

Yeah 

Which is rather nice

So he 's down there for eight weeks 

Oh well ours won't be till September  as usual

Yes well you you really need it then don't you

I find that if I have the holiday in July August the autumn term is too darn long 

but for a number of years we 've always taken an October week break

so I think that 's the

Yes

Yes very relaxing

Thanks Barry

Now you mentioned that you 'd developed you 're new to us you developed a whole load of sensitivity over the last two or three days 

and is it just confined to one area of your mouth or is it general

That 's right yes

It 's actually the whole lot

Yes this is why I asked if you had any uhm environmental changes with diet like  acids grapefruit and things because that can uhm that can do it

Not really no

I don't think so

Where 's your primary problem at the moment

You said it was fairly general

The lower front or

At the front here

I 'd say that I can feel uhm it 's this tooth here 

I mean it 's all of them but uhm you know along the top here  and when I drink cold water now it 's really painful which it never has been before now  and it 's almost as if it 's kind of numb 

Yes

Uhm

Stick your tongue out 

Right out

Lean over

OK

No soreness on the tongue



 away again 

Is that cold

Uhm 

Right

Have you had the flu or you 've been generally run down in the last few days

I 've had the flu a few times actually this year

Yeah

Do you feel a bit low

Are you running late nights working hard for exams or

Yeah I 'm 

Burning the candle at both ends quite a bit are you

Well I 'm I 'm just about to make a move

I 'm actually going off to Japan and I think that 's been playing on my mind a bit

Yeah

OK

You have got  the early stages of a gum infection which is not uncommon at this time of the year

Right

It 's caused by two germs that live together  and scratch each other 's back 

They 're called symbiotic  relationship

They both produce sort of chemistry with the other 's need  so they live together 

They only thrive in dingy  stagnant areas where the oxygen levels are fairly low 

Now if you take that mirror  the teeth aren't particularly clean and the  interstitial food impaction 

They 're areas of deprived oxygen 

and we can begin to see if I blow that back

you can just see  these ulcerations starting in between there

Yeah

Uhm

Right

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Can you see that

Uhm

That 's where that infection lurks 

Now this is all the way round the root detine and they are very sensitive 

and the inflammation of the gums

can you see that red line

that causes the teeth to be inflamed in their sockets as well

That makes them  a reflex hypersensitive so the whole thing gels

Get rid of the infection and your symptoms will subside

Uhm

Uhm

I see

Righto

I 'm going to give you a prescription to clear up the infection 

then you need to have your teeth extremely thoroughly cleaned  as soon as possible

Now when are you going off to Japan

Right

Well actually not for another month

Oh that 's OK now

I wanted to come and have a really good checkup anyway 

Well you ought to do that certainly

Now I 'll uh give you a prescription for a simple course of treatment which comprises a tablet  three times a day every eight hours  and a mouthwash five times a day approximately

Right

OK

Now the mouthwash is in a powder form 

You mix it as directed with a little bit of warm water 

you hold that in your mouth  and you sort of squeeze it between clenched teeth to and fro

You know what I mean

Right

Uhm

You try and squirt it between your teeth all the way round because you 're trying to get it to the intersp interphase uh interspace uh area

Right

Sure

It will fizz and froth

so it mechanically bubbles out debris as well  and you 've got to clean your teeth as best you can

Ignore any bleeding

They they They 're quite likely to bleed quite a bit

Have you noticed they 've been bleeding a lot recently

Uhm

Yeah they have

Yes

OK

That 's all part and parcel of it 

When did you last have your teeth seen and cleaned

Well actually I I said this morning that it was about three years 

but in actual fact I went to a guy about  eight months ago uhm and had the very early beginnings of cleaning

and I I I didn't it really hurt and I didn't go back

so I was a bit of a coward 

so I mean obviously it 's uh  

Yes

Yeah

Well this this treatment will make you a lot more comfortable  but it 's only sort of palliative

It 's killing off the germs of the moment

If we leave the uh precipitating condition  it will recur  so we want to clean them up thoroughly

and uh so what I 'm going to do is get you an appointment with our hygienist as soon as you can  to get them clean

and then come and see me for a general scrape round before you go to Japan

Yeah

Uhm

Right

Right

OK

OK

All right

OK 

Can I get somebody to relieve this gum disease 

Oh yes it once it gets it 's it 's sub-acute at the moment 

Uh if it goes to acute it 's very destructive

Your gums rot away  right down to the bone

Yes

Uh uh it can be very virulent if it 's if it 's left untreated  and if particularly if the patient is uhm very run down

In the First World War it was rife in the trenches and it was called trench mouth 

It was It 's very infectious in you know in a debilitated community which they were in the trenches

They were badly fed and cold and wet 

but it 's uh it 's not it is technically contagious uh

but uh you 'd probably be wise to keep your own uh utensils wash up separately

but that 's going over the top a little bit 

You know sensibly you 'll you 'll be over this in a couple of days

Around the tooth

Right

Right

Right

Uhm

Right

Oh yes OK 

Uh and I can get this from any chemist can I or

 prescription 

Eighty-four Endymon Endymion

Endymion Road

Endymion Road  Brixton

You did well to get here

Yeah I mean I rushed out of the house and straight up 

What are you going to do in Japan

Teach English actually

Uhm

Yeah 

I do appreciate you seeing me so quickly though

That 's OK 

About five times a day use the mouthwash

Just repeat that

OK

Uhm

Equal spacing so basically after each meal and uhm  uh an extra time or two in the evening 

But certainly before you go to bed

All right

And how long do I keep it in my mouth

Well a couple of minutes swishing it to and fro to and fro and then don't wash out with anything afterwards

Leave it in your mouth

It doesn't taste too horrible  but uh leave it round to do its job

Right

No

Right

All right 

There 's the prescription

OK 

There 's a chemist in Store Street just as you go out straight across the road towards the Tottenham Court Road

There 's a chemist about three shops along

All right I 'll go straight there 

And uh  yeah go and see reception cos you 'll need to book in with our hygienist  and book in with me for a general check round as well

OK

Now  we 've got an X-ray to look at 

This is the the  effect on that tooth 

and there 's some problems under the filling by the looks of it as well  but uh

Is the crack evident

You wouldn't see the crack on the X-ray 

It it 's a hairline crack

and it also be would be across or parallel to the plane of the X-ray

so you 'd be looking across the crack rather than down it

so it wouldn't be visible there 

It 's really just Uh it 's a question of just making sure the root form is suitable for crowning and uh rightly  or wrongly there is a statutory requirement to have an X-ray of a crown tooth on the  required by the dental board 

It 's unnecessary radiation in many respects

Uh I did need it in your case but uh occasionally you need to crown a tooth which is perfectly  you know perfectly sound from the  aspect and there 's no reason for an X-ray but  they they just insist on having one 

With one hand they 're telling you to reduce radiation at all costs 

On the other hand they 're saying if you don't have an X-ray we won't give you your fee 

Bureaucracy 's gone totally mad 

Yes

Hairline

Right yes yes

I 'm pleased that uh you had a cancellation this morning 

otherwise I 'm I 'm uh going away in February for uh two weeks to uh the uh to do some neutron scattering

so I shall get my annual dose then 

You 're well screened against  that surely

Uhm

Oh yes yeah yes

Yes

In fact the uh uhm I don't know what the dose for uh a a typical medical X-ray is

but it 's usually stated to us that uh that is considerably greater than the uh than the uh level of rad background radiation you 'd get if you spent a couple of weeks by a reactor

Yes yes quite likely because it 's there 's there 's a specific radiation source uhm 

We 've got a a quite high  machine here with good 

and we also have a double speed filter  so we halve the dose exposure each each uh time 

It manages to produce quite a fast emulsion  so it makes sense to use it 

In fact we 've managed to drop it down two stops on the exposure machine  so we get good results 

You can see if you look at the machine over there  the two top the higher dials the small one the one near the hand switch  there you can see that the  is down to its lowest  on to the right

There 's one more notch to go down uh so it 's it 's well  well down the range for exposure 

It 's on two 

We were running on four before 

Right yes

Yes right

Oh

Yes

Yes yes yes

Yes yes

Yes yes yes

The The uh films you still have to essentially uh the

it 's still wet film process

There 's There 's no sort of polaroid instant developed yet

Yes it 's wet

we have

Uh no no but we have a dry-to-dry process

It 's wet chemicals  but it 's just mechanically dried at the end of it

Uh we post it through developer fixer wash dry

It comes up in about four and a half minutes dry to dry 

What I think I 'm going to do is I 'm just going to take the filling out and investigate and see whether I can uh  see the crack inside 

Do you have anything to do with uh is it CERN or the Taur European Taurus and all that

Yes

No I 'm uh  well I 'm I 'm

I 'm physics department

It 's solid state physics  you know

it 's not neutron scattering  as such

You 're crystallography

aren't you

Yes it 's not yes

More to do with the crystallography side is it

Uhm yes

Uh my own interest is magnetism uh you know the magnetic structures of uh uh complicated materials 

Uh my cousin 's son is an architect in Japan and uh he was talking about all the work they 're doing on the uh new monorail type things with the uh makeweights uh levitation motors and so on

These big ceramic uh uh magnets with these uhm so-called 

and uh they 're very exciting of course

Yes

Yes yes yes

That 's right

 yes yes

Yes yes

That 's the sort of thing that I I 'm really the the the at the very basic materials end essentially doing what we think is the strategic research that in ten or twenty years ' time will hopefully be uh bear fruit in that uh in that research

Yes

Bear fruit

Uhm

Yeah

But they 're getting this uh the temperatures up on these super conductors at the moment aren't they 

liquid nitrogen

aren't they

Yes yes yes it 's now  yes yes yes

That was a massive breakthrough 

Now

Yes

Cos liquid nitrogen 's cheap

Yes it 's it 's I always say 

yes I always compare it

Liquid Uh liquid nitrogen is the s is the same price as milk

In fact it 's cheaper than milk and uh liquid helium 's about the same price as uh wine

Whereas liquid helium is uh

What quality wine 

You obviously have your comparative priorities correct 

Yes

It 's a good thing you  came here 

Could you  up a little bit

A bit more 

Yes he was saying they were coming up against all sorts of problems with uh  uhm the effect of these huge magnetic fields on potential passengers and so on

In fact people with pacemakers or any electronic devices on health would be uh most unwise  to travel on them unless they can screen them better

Sorry

Yes

Yeah

Yeah they

The the the The residual field is still quite small but the problem is that these pacemakers are sensitive to it to very small fields

Very small

That 's right

That 's Uh that 's a problem

The uh the The technical difficulty at the moment with these new superconductor materials is to turn them into wires because the they 're ceramic and so uh as you can imagine it 's very hard to make them into wires

The uh

Wires

that 's right

Ceramics

You presumably can at very high temperatures

You can spin them out uh although you have to actually make the coil you know a semi-molten state and then it 's set into that coil

Yes it would probably be in some form of copper matrix so that you have uh sort of thin strands of the superconductor material  you know  inside them

Yes

Rather like a fibre optic glass

Yes something like that

Yes

Because the thickness won't matter would it because if they 've got a negative resistance they can't heat up

That 's

that 's

that 's uh

that

I mean OK I 'm sorry zero resistance

Zero resistance

Yes

Yes yes

Or all but zero which resistance

No it really is zero

Yes

It really is zero 

It 's it uhm   sort of records

uh somebody set a current going in a coil about ten years ago  and it 's still going around

It 's still going

Uhm

But uhm the first application to actually come in is satellites because uh uh in the uh microwave repeaters that are uh uh used to uh harness satellite uh television

To boost the signal yes

To boost the signal

but uhm uhm uhm of course it 's actually very difficult 

Uh money doesn't count

They 're expensive to make at the moment

but you gain on gain on weight because you can 

And also once you put the power into the air it 's totally different whereas if you 've got battery packs or uh solar cells they will break down  particularly in the harsh environment of space  or even nuclear reactors

Nuclear reactors they 're not environmentally friendly because they break up the kind of  and also they have 

Yes

Yes

I 'm not

I 'm I 'm

I 'm I 'm not very happy with that because uh that is uh that is how the Russians powered uh the

Well I mean they 're putting chunks of plutonium up there which in fact they are

then that plutonium is going to shatter and disintegrate over quite a large area of the country

The last one came down in w wastes of Canada which is probably quite providential because if it came over a populated area it wouldn't be very nice for them

I suppose

Yes

Well even even the stuff being spread around in the atmosphere but uh

Well that 's that 's it but I don't think the plutonium does

It tends to come down as a as a lump

It 's a bit more

Yes it sh if it 's properly shielded you know it should do

Yes yes but the burn up uh probably destroys the shield and the thing probably develop comes back to earth in a lump and probably shatters on impact and then it 's uh in the environment

It 's not Uh it 's not a very uh  satisfying way of doing things 

We learn the hard way though don't we the human race

We make mistakes

Sometimes we learn by our mistakes often we don't 



Yes but uh I want to take the amalgam out

I 'm not happy with the uh  appearance of the tooth 

This is a very old filling I think 

There doesn't seem to be any lining under it 

Could you pass me the uh the diagnostic light there 

Take the mirror Professor

I 'll try and show you if I can 

That is the the filling taken out of the cavity

There was no lining

You can still see a little bit of amalgam in the depths there

There should be a white intuating lining underneath it 

Now I don't know if I 've got the angle of the mirror right

Just along there you 'll see some sort of crack 

It 's a hole in the outside cusp as I  said it would go

I 'll I 'll turn the light off there so you can see better 

Not too easy to see 

I can see it

It looks like a hairline just down at the bottom

Light

Uhm uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm



It 's fore and aft as it were

There  and there

Under this cusp if you look at the root of that cusp you can see a crack across it 

A dark line    the light going straight that

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm uhm

Down at the bottom 

OK I 'll I 'll clear out the cavity

I 'll fill it up with glass and I 'll shove it down in there 

Ah now 

How long have you made that one last

Before my time that one

Yes yes well I had I had I lived in France for six years

 

Not being a lover of the French I would blame the French

I don't think the Danes would not line a filling 

Actually I think that  to uhm do a crown preparation at the moment  Gillian

Yeah

 

I 'm inclined to put a sedative in it and reduce the cusp  and leave the crown preparation for uhm when you 're going away 

If you do me uh  a little bit of uh arthurnina or zical  first

Just a tiny spot 

and then I 'll fill it up with  tipax silver 

and then I 'll reduce the cusp after that 

But I suppose that liquid helium is is uhm cheaper than it used to be because it 's quite uhm it 's quite common in natural gas isn't it  though it 's probably more expensive to produce it from the liquification of air 

I suppose that 's a source of helium they need balloons for now in the in the gas industry rather than the liquification of air

Yes

Yes it comes from oil wells

Yes uhm

Most of it comes from Texas the gas

Yes yes 

I think I can show you that crack

Don't look back at that  will you

No  

I 've put a sedative sublining in the uh  the dangerous part 

Pass that diagnostic light again

See if it shows up any better 

Perhaps you 'd pass me the uhm the large mirror 

It might be easier for Professor  

Just  how about I mean you just put that so you can actually see into the cavity

Can you see that

I can

Uhm uhm uh uhm 

Now I can see the crack right now  a black line 

Ah along there  right through to there 

That black mark is a bit of amalgam still there 

Right across there 

Uhm uhm

Yes I can see it clearly there

Right

Can you take the  off 

To be fair on  you 've got you 've got discoloration here

so it 's already been penetrated

so I 'll  

Are these super superconducting ceramics very expensive to manufacture 

I mean the raw material I mean

How you fashion them of course is the big big problem

but are they expensive in themselves

The raw mat material

No 

But they have to be made as a coil

Just a simple simple annulus is not enough 

Well you could to make a make a uh uhm magnet a magnetic field magnetic field you need uh  many many c many many turns

 is proportional to the number of turns

N squared in fact

I think it 's N squared

Uhm  that 's the uh that 's that 's uh the problem project

You really do need to  uhm 

If you 're looking at the uh the microwave properties then  uh it 's essentially you need to fashion a cavity 

That 's that 's with ceramic of course that 's not too difficult to make 

That 's why applications involving those things have already been carried out 

A whole series of them

Wires

Yes

Yes

Yes

No

I 'm going to let that set  and then I 'm going to reduce it down 

I 'm now what are your movements

You say you 're going abroad

Right

I 'm I 'm here until I 'm going on the on the my last day here is the fourth of February 

I can come any essentially any time before then

And how long will you be away

Uh well I 'm I 'm away uhm for two uh I 'm away for two weeks uh

but then I 'm immediately going on to uhm a meeting in Abingdon for another week  uhm

and when I can

Yes

Is there any sort of window time between you arriving back and going to Abingdon

There 's a there 's a day there 's a Monday morning

Well what I 'm saying is if if

I 'd like because the tooth is very sensitive at the moment I want I don't want to add insult to injury 

I want to I 've put something in to rest the tooth and to reinforce it uh hold it together  and I 'm going to uh I 'd really like to leave leave it quieten down for a week or two 

If we did the preparation just before you went  and put it on secure it temporarily for a fortnight 

Uh the temporary will be quite satisfactory

You know it will work all right  uhm

and then we could cement the crown on that window before you went to Abingdon

or we could in fact if it 's only three weeks in total no reason to rush it

but uhm I think it would be bearing in mind you are going away

and that 's the inconvenience of it

I think you 'd be safer  to leave it  to uh settle 

If I pushed our luck now it may send may send it over the top and you may lose the tooth 

Yes yes

Right

Yes

Right

Yes

Yes

OK

Yes yes yes

So you put you put in the sedative is it and uh

The sedative was that white stuff

I put it cos that 's the deepest part of the cavity and then I 've actually filled this uh main body of the tooth with a glass and metal cement

It 's called uh oat silver  and the glass  bonds to to itself  uh

and then you 've got this problem point where you get the leverage effect like that

so I 'm going to reduce that point down

so you haven't got the leverage effect

and so it 's

Right

Yes

Uhm

Right yes

Yes

Right that 's that 's the dangerous point for the thing cracking off

That 's right so I 'm going to reduce the gradient  

I think it is setting 

I 'm actually going back to Denmark for two weeks

Is that where you 're going to throw your neutrons about

Yes it is 

They have a uhm  uh a facility there at uh Placename which is about twenty miles from Copenhagen 

Facility there

Have you been there before

Yes I have

I 've been there for three years 

Danes are nice people

aren't they

Yes yes they 're extremely friendly when you get to know them

Yes

When you get to know them yes

but they 're a bit reserved

I think most of the Scandinavians are

Yes  yes

But the Danes are the easiest to get to know

That 's right

yes the Swedes 

Yes 

Is that still too difficult to bite with

OK

Feels all right now uhm

Yeah 

Just just slide your teeth together

Slide around  right around 

That lower cusp is also a bit pointy 

It acts like a ram 

I 'm reducing it with the uhm the  on it anyway 

It 's actually like a chisel

I 'm wedging the two cusps apart 

Now we get down right in the point 

What 's the problem

Well I 'm on

I think I 've got thrush again 

I 'm not sure if it is again  and I 've now got a discharge as well 

a discharge 

Have you

Yeah

Yes

Now you had thrush quite recently didn't you  and you had some Canesten

Did that improve it to begin with

Uhm yes

No no

It would start off OK and then it goes again

Start off again

Yes 

And have you had thrush in the past

Uhm I had it about two years ago

Oh not since then no

And have you recently had antibiotics for anything 

No no

And you 're on the pill

Yeah but I don't 

That makes it a bit more likely

You don't like a-few-words-obscured-by-telephone-ring



That 's the third funny call I 've had

Uhm  OK 

You haven't had a a swab sent off to the lab

No

We 'd better do that  to just to check what it is

and then I can give you an oral dose of something  and uhm  we 'll see if that does the trick 

So we 'll send off a vaginal swab 

What 's the date

It 's the fifth 

If you 'll just come next door

OK

OK

OK what 's the problem

Uhm  I came last week and saw the practice nurse and actually had a positive pregnancy test

Uh  right and that 's not good news

Not at all  no

Uhm and also I 'm a midwife and I 've been working on nights which delayed me coming in for a test anyway 

And I 'm not sure of my dates

I mean my last period is I 'm sure of was on the sixth of the eleventh but before then my periods have been not  what I would usually expect and I have done pregnancy tests on those occasions but they were negative

Uh uhm

Yeah

Now for how many months do you think you 've had abnormal  uhm periods

Definitely since the the period before then was the eight of October but very light 

And that was a light one

was it 

all of it uhm

Yeah

But very clotty

very 

Uhm 

OK 

Now uhm were you using any form of contraception

Yes I use the cap and spermicide

Uhm

And you 've been using that for some time

Yes 

So you 're quite good at it you thought

Yes 

Yes 

So uhm  I think what I what I 'd better do actually is examine you and see whether the uterus is enlarged to a certain level

and then uhm  we can refer you for a termination

Now  where would you like to have it 

Sure

Uhm well I 've heard E T A is good

You 're happy to go there

Uh uhm

Yeah although you 're connected

Yes yes that 's fine 

The service is good  yeah 

OK if you 'd like to come next door we 'll just examine you

Uhm now what 's the problem at the moment

Uh it 's not a problem

I 've run out of Binoxon cream that I use for my back

I was wondering if you 'd give me another prescription for it

What 's it called the the

Uhm 

I have actually got the empty tube with me

Let 's have a look 

Binoxon

Yes

Yes does that help

Yes there wa

Uhm I used to use uhm the 

there was an orange tube 

I think they stopped making that  and they gave me a lotion  that wasn't as good as the cream 

Yes

Yes

Uh uhm

Now I saw you was it a year ago when you were having back pain

Yes

Yes

So how have you been since then

No

Not so bad

Oh how has the back been

Uhm it happened once in the summer and I started getting pain in the bottom of my back in the same place

so I just took uh some of the tablets you gave me and it cleared up within two days

That 's just happened once



Yeah

Uhm

Uhm

That 's good

Are you very active

Do you do sports and things

I play rugby 

I see

I just started playing this term

Yes how is that going

That 's fine

In fact I 'm really enjoying it and

Are you in the college team

Yes

Yes so you 're beating everybody

Yes so far

Reading 's beaten us but we beat name

Yeah

Uh I 'm getting pains in my legs just when I 'm running but I think that 's just because I haven't run around a lot

Yeah

Well I think one of the problems is if you run to train if you can possibly do it just run on grass and not on on concrete

Uhm yeah I do

You do yes

Well that 's not so bad then

Uhm 

OK

So I 'll give you the prescription for this

Is there anything else you need

No

No 

Thirty grams



Yeah  that 's forty grams 

And your health is otherwise good

Yes it 's fine 

Are you taking any other medicines

No 

And you 're not on the pill

No

No 

And how 's work going now

That 's fine now I really

I hated London last year but uhm

You got used to it

Yes I 've settled in  and I 'm enjoying it now 

It 's a bit of a shock to begin with

isn't it

 yes 

OK  I presume you 've changed address since last year

Yes

In which case we 'd better get you to fill in one of these forms 

If you put your new uhm address there no there and the old address and your name 

OK

Just name and address 

OK thanks very much 

Here 's your prescription

OK 

Thanks very much

Right

Keep you going OK

OK thanks a lot 

Bye

Bye

Bye bye

Do you know are you going to be here at uh  two o'clock

I 've got a tutorial at two

Well if you see Genevieve will you say that we 're going to Palms

Yeah

Yes

So you 're going to Palms

We 're going to Palms  in a minute

In a minute

Well I 'll see you up there

Who 're you going with 

You 're going with the girls aren't you Billy

yes you are you lying bugger

Caroline are you coming the pub tonight

No I 'm not coming to the pub tonight

I 'm going to Birkbeck

Why not

You swot 

Oh yes I know 

I have to swot

I 'm not clever like you lot 

Anyway listen

so when are we going together then to do this revision

Well look

shall I call you at the weekend

and we 'll do it early next week  because uhm  I want to start 

Actually I 'm going up to Barnet next week to use my friend 's computer for my course essay so  if I call in with you one day on the way up there or on the way back then I 've got the stuff

Cos I need it to revise

you need it to revise as well

I know I 'm sure

I 'm really a bit worried actually because when we did the last class  I mean I was OK for an hour  literally for an hour and then he went on to implications of  inside the inside the Beowulf and the whole lot of us were totally lost  every single one of us

Were you Joan

were you lost in Richard 's seminar the other night

Yeah right

No I was super 

I really enjoyed it

Did you get the implications of everything then

No

Uhm cos Caroline was just asking what it was about the other night 

Well it was he was you know sort of  dodging about  about family trees and about and about Deor and about  and about those things and it was interesting 

I don't I don't suppose there was anything fantastically useful

but it was just interesting

Uhm

Oh right

oh good

So you really haven't missed any of the no

Not Not any of the real meat I don't think 

Just a little bit about the 

Yes yes

What about the translation

Did he go through that

No what he did in

I I thought what he did was he actually darkened it 

I actually saw the the light side of Beowulf but there I saw the dark side of Beowulf the  side of Beowulf

Did you feel like that

Uhm right

But how much translation have you done 

What did you get up to

I think he didn't actually do an awful lot of translation did he

Where 'd you get to

Did you start off at two thousand and go on to 

Yeah

No I I want to be able to 

He did that a bit

Yes all right so

And then he just

More than a few hundred

No I wouldn't have thought so Joan

No no we 've only done two hundred lines

No

Oh OK good

Because he just switched again over to the search of Beowulf and how uhm  we could actually see uhm what he was doing at the end with Wiglaf wasn't it  and why why he was then  why was he so keen

And why you know why the light stops and why Beowulf would never  never be 

He glossed over that

but he thinks that Beowulf never  

He was probably  uh a champion a mercenary

Yeah wasn't he busy being uh a hero and then a king 

Well he it 's unusual for a champion to be

No he he could either have one or the other

that 's what he was saying

No that 's right yeah

Uh uh I don't know what it gave me

I didn't particularly want the

So he really made a tactical mistake to go after the dragon himself

Right 

He was then a king

and he should have sent a 

Yes he should have been king yeah

He was king so he shouldn't have done that yeah right 

So what about Wiglaf then continuing the line

Cos he was one of the Wig Wiglaf

Is this Wigmun yeah Wigmunding

Right uh it 's not

That 's right  he 's somewhere

He 's not yet

The strain  

I wanted to ask you 

Has Is Jane here today

Yeah 

She is actually

She is

Where is she

I think she 's gone to the crypt 

Well I shan't see her

that 's for sure

What did you want to ask me Joan

Uh nothing except about Jane

Is that Jane 's pencil case up there 

Where

Billy found it on the top of the pigeon holes

Yes

I thought so

I 'm not sure

Well it 's Jane 's or Isla 's isn't it

Actually he

Jane 's got got 

and it isn't there

Are you going to go Caroline

Yes

Are you going

Well he 's not really her boyfriend he 's a uh

OK then

See you 

Right so there you are eh

That was great

Oh I made this big thing about how I got these two long essays to do this term you see

so I said oh well you know  that 's this term

Oh I see

Oh so he accepted that

The shit 

He didn't say anything to me

I said I don't want to do any more essays

He said oh yes you are

You 've got to do another one 

Now what 's happening to this thing here

Oh I tell you what

I can't stand this 

What I don't like about him is he keeps going on as if you know every word in these things you 're writing about 

I just make it up  and hope it 's right 

I 've got this stupid course essay to finish

Oh I can't

I 'm not doing the course essay

I re put myself down for it but I 'm not doing it

Well I

Uhm hello

Hello dear how are you

I was just talking to everyone  probably 

How are you

I haven't seen you for ages

No I 've been in hiding lying low

What have you been up to

Have you been doing your old opera

My old opera

No

What happens with that

No I 'm really really angry with it 

I wrote I turned up the first night right

Well for two weeks before I didn't really do much but you know like before that I 'd I 'd done stacks in the summer and I turned up and uhm 

Because I Because I didn't have time to do sewing you know

She wanted me to anyway I 'll tell you to do dressmaking the first night

Uhm

Uhm

They hadn't put me down in the programme

I 'm an assistant manager and they hadn't put me down

I know because I didn't turn up for the last two weeks

Really

Stupid

I wasn't expecting anything major

I just put you know 

cos I put in maybe you know fifteen hours work on this thing

Yes of course

Good God yeah

I mean ask Nigel you know 

He is such an awful perv and you know he is so revolting and and unspokenly he 's such an old lecherous git 

And I saw him and I 'd forgotten

you know you forget how awful some people are if you haven't seen them for ages 

And I said sort of oh hello oh all right

And then he said uh will you play for the opera for me sort of thing and I said oh you know maybe I 'll I 'll consult

Yeah exactly

and he kept saying well you 'll definitely be really good you know

We 'll get someone to step in for you 

I mean he 's only playing fourth anyway

And I said well maybe you know I 'll look in my you know in my diary

He is

He is I know

Awful

Oh fatal mistake

For him

At least we 've got your phone number 

So I thought and I 'm really stupid about this

I mean did you ever give people your number so you know when they sort of faze you though you know and you can't sort of make one up quick enough 

And I gave it to him and I thought he 'll never sort of get me anyway cos it 's Goldsmith House and you can never get through

So I gave it to him thinking I was fairly safe

and he recognised it

and he said ooh it 's Goldsmith House isn't it

The girl I 'm seeing at the moment lives there and I thought oh shit

And he said what 's your room number 

And I had to tell him because you can't suddenly say you 've forgotten your room number or anything can you like you know  

And I live on the same floor as his bloody girlfriend a few doors away

I can't believe it

Out of a hundred and fifty rooms  

And he turned up at my door

There was this knock on the door and I opened it and sort of tried to close it again

And he just  slammed the door into my bedroom

It was remarkable

No I said  you know

I said wait a minute

It was just incredible cos my body language

I was  sort of standing in the doorway trying you know saying I 'll just go and look for my 

And that slime he was in my room saying have you got a pen you know

I like picked up my keys and said I 'm going out now 

I walked out

So what happened

Did he turn up



This guy did not want to know

You didn't have your bra on 

You didn't leave him there

No

We were talking about uhm  that that that man at college who told you who who was saying all these outrageous things to you

Oh god oh my god oh my god

That got worse

I don't believe it

It was so embarrassing

Oh do tell me

What was the first one

What did he say to you once in the

He said

I can't really say now

There 's people here  

Oh yes

I remember

 You have to say it

Oh can't you can't you take it can't you take the phone somewhere else

Not really

Why not

Well there 's  there 's nowhere to go 

Well no

He said uhm 

What did he say

He said  uhm 

No but it was the one that the one that made me laugh

I mean I remember when he I mean I remember all the rude ones but there was the one in the canteen that he said to you



What about the uhm 

Yes

He said he was a palm-reader

And he said he said uhm well you 're obviously  slow 

and  he said you 're obviously terribly slow very imperceptive

and you 've got an appalling memory  

My hackles are really rising by this time

And uhm and he said and if you want to pass your exams you 'd really better start now

And I and I said oh yes and uhm and  where did you uhm learn to do this then palm-read

He said from a book

I said well you 're obviously not very good at it are you 

Yeah

And then he said uhm and then I said I was going to aerobics

He and he said  why

I said well you know why not it 's good for you

He said  well there 's not really very much point

you 're going to get fat anyway 

That 's just spite 

You 're going to get fat anyway

Oh wonderful

I know

You don't want to worry about fat

You 're going to be kind of  big mama type I thought 

This is supposed to make me want to go out with you 

Oh my god

Oh my god it was so embarrassing

There was this uhm  I was talking to this this guy at college and uhm he 's really really really boring and he always always says the same thing 

And uhm  the oth other

And I must 've told Albie this guy I was telling you about that he was boring although I I don't because he knows him I don't know why I told him that

But uhm  he said to him the other day we had exams the other day 

and uhm  he said Jenny I think you 're really nice

I said oh I really that 's really sweet of you

Thank you

And he said uhm  do you think I 'm nice 

And I said uhm 

Yes

This is the one that is really boring

And I said well yes of course I do

And he said  because some people think I 'm boring you know 

And I thought oh my god

And he was obviously talking about me

And he said and some people say I repeat myself all the time

And I thought oh my god

how 'm I going to get out of this one

This is the one that you think is boring

And some people say and some people say I repeat myself

I repeat myself all the time

I know

And I said oh really 

And uhm and he said  well what do you think Jenny

And I thought oh god

And I said  well I couldn't say I couldn't say no you 're not boring because because it was so obvious  I mean 

Because he is

Quite

I couldn't lie could I

I said  well I wouldn't call it boring

I 'd call it more  predictable

But that is not necessarily a negative sort of a word you know Albie

So in the end I convinced him that he was predictable in a posher sort of way

Because he is

Oh God Jenny you 're such a creep

I know

Well I didn't want to hurt his feelings 

Bit mean to talk about people behind their back isn't it

Things that you can

There are other ways you can get round that one

You can say well why do you think people think say you 're boring

Well he knows why because I said why

Well what 

Because he always always always says the same thing

He always says something like

I mean for the

When I was walking across the par car park that day he said  Jenny you 're the most beautiful thing that ever walked on this earth

I thought oh make me yawn 

And I said oh really 

And I sort of roll my eyes and yawn every time he opens his mouth 

And he said and I said hello Albie how are you

And he always always says all the better for seeing you

Oh for goodness sake

He makes me die 

So that 's why he 's boring

He knows why 

Uhm funny

 Oh it 's a shame the other thing didn't come out 

Uhm I 've just been pa I 've just been handed something to give you here

Oh what

My tape

No 

Is this for 

Is this for sending

Can this be sent 

The University of London External Advisory Service

Final examinations in Law

Study notes 

Oh really

Who gave you that

Uhm 

 even though I said he was boring as well 

Oh god

Actually I think it 's probably me isn't it

It 's probably not everyone else 

No no

It 's probably everyone else Jenny

Don't worry 

You 've never said I 'm boring

 Oh God

We 're all right then

It must just be the men

No no  the men in the world don't worry about it



I think it was because he was wearing a mask and  

You really can't con  you can't concentrate on what people are saying when they 're wearing a mask

I mean your attention 

Especially when they 're talking about something really boring 

So I think that 's why 

So no offence

No no no

No don't worry about it really 

I 'll leave it to your discretion

Stick to your guns

stick to your gun girl 

Anyway uhm 

Did you want me for something

No no no

I was just phoning up for one of our silly conversations really

 Oh that 's nice

So what 's the news from the man in Italy 

Any news on that one

 None yet

Or no more

So nothing very in fact nothing has happened to me at all over the last week 

Uhm I had my exams last  I had the well I had three tests before I came up here

Uhm 

And now I j now I 've just got a few weeks off until the finals

It 's an absolute nightmare

Have you had yours

I 've had I 've had uh two exams so far but they were the easy ones

I I did quite well in those I think 

I had the French spoken which I was doing all right at and the French listening which I was obviously which I also did all right at

I 've got the French written paper on Thursday which I 'm not looking forward to at all

Oh great

Oh

But uhm

But I 'm sure I had something to tell you 

I can't think what it was though

Well it 's always to do with men Jenny

So if you think of men it 's going to be something

 Oh no 

I was going to ask you if you were ever going to send my tape back 

Oh your tape

 Yes

Oh yes I spotted that the other day

I must

Oh have you still got it

Oh that 's good

Yes

No

I haven't lost it

Oh that 's OK then

You know I can't think what it was

I just  I di I thought it was a bit much when it s you know when I looked at it and it said seducing tape on it

Seducing tape

Seducing tape

I know

I need it

Send it back 

Who 're you 

Who 're you wanting to seduce



No

Actually nobody 



No

But you know

Be prepared for all eventualities and all that

You 're too much

You are outrageous

No I no really really

There 's  nobody

No nobody

There 's nobody you want to seduce

I 'm working on it

Give me time 

Uhm

Oh yes there is actually

Actually I am

Actually yes

I 've got my

I 

Yes

It just struck me

Actually actually



Oh yes

Tell me more

Who 's this

Yes

Well I don't know

This guy at college

He 's in my class

But only because I 'm so bored at the moment

Uhm

But but nobody very interesting

I see

You just want somebody for the capacity of hot water bottle basically

Oh well no

Sorry

Uhm I just want to go out for a drink with him  

Wait a minute

I 'll have to try and deduce what you 're saying here because there 's people in the room

No no I really do no  

You don't want to sleep with him

No 

You sure

Yeah 

So why do you need a tape called the seducing tape just to ask him out for a drink

I 'm just going to put it in a Walkman and stick it over his ears 

Oh I see

Yeah next lesson

No uhm

Well I don't know

He might not want to might he

But he might do

I think he does actually

Want to go to bed with you

No no no no no no

Want to go out for a drink

Jumping the gun a bit there 

Uhm uhm uhm

You kno you remember Jane

Oh no I can't have this conversation I 've just realised

It 's all right

I 'll tell you another time when the conversation 's not being recorded

Oh why

Oh 



Why

Oh nothing

Oh OK then

Uhm

So that 's it then is it

That 's all the gossip for this week

I 'm afraid I haven't got any

Nothing juicy anyway

Uhm or d well I could try and think of some but

No no no

That 's that 's  that 's all right

No really

Absolutely nothing 's happened to me

Isn't it awful

No no

Not at all

It 's light relief

But what 's happened to you

Something must 've happened to you 

No not really uh uhm

Oh is he

Well you could 've told me that before I was spouting off banging on about this that and the other

No no no n

No no no

That

that 's all fine 

Gosh

Oh thank goodness

Thank goodness I didn't say anything awful  because I could 've done



No no no

Oh that 's terrible

Give me a warning next time 

No

That was fine

Uhm no no

There 's nothing

I mean you know I 'm still uhm  living with this man and it 's all going well

Is he still cooking

Yeah 



Yeah 

Good

And uh

Have you

have you still got the other two then

the other two

The other two lodgers yes

The other two lodgers are both still here

and they 're fine and

Oh good

And how 's Emily

She 's wonderful

She 's great

She 's just had she 's just had her school photo

You know her her school photo for this year

So sweet

She looks so big 

Uh I mean these children of seven

When I compare them with the children of four it 's just absolutely unbelievable 

Oh that 's sweet  

Oh well she is

Yeah

And she uh  she 's so sophisticated and grown-up

And she plays the piano

It 's just amazing the way she 's so quick at picking up the music 

So 

So how are you

I 'm OK 

I 'm all right

I got 

I haven't been well actually

Why

What

Since I spoke to you yesterday

Yeah I mean stomach cramps  squiffy botty and things

Oh

Squitty botty

Squiffy botty

Yeah

Oh squiffy

Same thing really





Uh and oh I got a job today

Oh good

Oh not the four lines on 

Yeah

Oh

And uh to add insult to injury it 's two lines 

one of them 's a word

You 're kidding

Oh you 're kidding

Yeah 

But three hundred and sixty-five quid

But why I don't understand

why don't they use an extra if they want one line and one word

I don't think you can  under Equity 

Oh you can

Well 

The actually the I have to say that the

I mean I I I 

It went i incredibly well

I mean I just thought I 'll just wait for these bastards to ask me to read this because they gave it to me before you know

Well

And it was delightful

They were Linda Butcher and uh Mike Vardy



Yeah

I think I met them

Most delightful interview but uh 

And they obviously didn't ask me to read

And I thought well that 's  you know what a joke

Uhm  but then they said listen we need to you know  decide very promptly

So and by the time I got home they 'd already phoned my agent

So my agent phoned me and said listen they they talked at length 

and I think  they were just sort of  making up for  for the embarrassment of having to  ask me  such an experienced artiste to come in for those two lines

But uhm they were saying  uh  they want to enhance these uhm  sce the scene of crimes officer department  uh into the plot 

and therefore they may well be asking me back later in the year  to do some more work

But I you know I think you just  take that as read as well you know and I 'll I 'll hear from you when I hear from you

Uhm

Yes

Yeah 

But yeah so 

Oh well 

It 's better than a bang on the nose I suppose poke in the eye with a sharp stick

Yeah yeah 

I suppose so

It is uh well I don't want to sound blas&eacute; or 

Oh no I mean no don't worry about it

I would feel exactly the same as you

Yeah I really

The money 's great

And  and uh  rehearse next Thursday next Friday 

Shoot thirtieth of June 

But uh  and I just smiled about something and you know  well

That 's it

I 've arrived 

Did something on from little acorns

You can't get much littler than this can you

 

Uh you know  a few years ago  T V series

No one 'll ever see it

No one 'll know any different 

Should 've been the bank robber in that  in the uh

Oh I don't know

I think I got more fame than from my  four lines in Eastenders than I got from any other piece of work I ever did 



Well i it 's slightly humorous because I mean the rea and the oh yes the staff oh they 're great 

The reason why they wanted to see me

Yeah you told me

It 's all right

You don't have to tell me again



Yeah

Sorry

I forgot that



So what did you do today 

Uhm

Swotting away

Yeah

I went into the library this morning and swotted 

And uhm  and then I strolled round the library this afternoon looking at videos for Emily to watch next week if she comes in to school and accidentally saw two videos vaguely related to the subject I 'm studying 

Sat and watched telly for the afternoon  watching these programmes 

Ah

Brilliant

About uh one 's about the human brain and language 

And the other 's about uh this guy called Chomsky  who 's uh  well one of the world 's most important human beings if you happen to be interested in linguistics 

Chomsky

Uhm

I 've heard of him

You 've heard of him

Yeah I have

I 'm trying to think of of

To do with mind psychology or

And yeah you 'd 've studied him whatever

I 've definitely heard of Chomsky

Noam Chomsky

Uhm Noam Chomsky uhm

Mm

Yeah   

Definitely rings a bell

I can tell you bugger all about him though

Yeah

That 's the one

 So you 're still painting your mum this weekend

Yeah  yeah

I think 

Uh go down tomorrow

I 'm meeting her at Windsor at twelve  for lunch

And then we 're going to  buy paints and uh  work on it

And then Saturday night stay down at  you know you know  Dan and Jane 's

The Berner linguistic survey

David speaks for English solid

Bo-fucking-ring uhm

Interesting one

It 's putting a word and putting an expletive in the middle

That 's uh 

Yeah



Yeah

Ah but uhm 

Tuesday I 'm going down to the theatre in Farnham

Uhm

What is that

That 's

Is that  I know that title very well but I can't place it 

There 's a poem 

No

It won't it can't be a play about a poem 

No

But Jamaica Inn re reminds me of a

Poem

Oh do you remember an inn Miranda

Hello stranger

But anyway

Yes

Mm

All right I 'm going out with someone 

There you are 

Well that 's

Coo

No

Someone

Coo 

Never have guessed

No

Mm a man

A man even

A man

and he 's called someone

Yes

Well that that that bloody nails it down to half the population  the other half being women 

No

You can keep your secrets

I don't want to know





No

I 've just told you

A man

And it 's someone

I 'm going out with all right I 'm going out with a man 

He 's called Yibin 

Yibin

Yibin

Oh

Yup

Very unusual name 

Uh guess where he comes from with a name like that

Uh Yorkshire

 Oh a laugh a minute here 

Well

Oh hold on a minute 

Hello 

Hello

Yes 

Uhm 

Well listen uhm

I feel silly now

No

That 's OK



Uhm I 'd better leave you to your  conversations

No no no no

Don't

Don't leave me to anything

No

Well you 're never going to sit on the phone for two hours after Yibin 's trying to understand

Yibin 's in the bath 

Oh 

And I 'm talking to you

Oh 

At his expense

No

At my expense 

Oh 

Right 

Say no more 

Uh 

What was I going to say

You were going to say so where does he come from

where did you meet him then 

Weren't you 

I wasn't actually

Oh all right then 

Don't show any interest in me then

No

I 'm I 'm a private person 

Sorry

But where does he come from and where did you meet him

 

 He comes from China  would you believe 

No

That 's nice

He 's Chinese

Oh

You 've mentioned him before

Oh actually he 's very strange

Yes

He 's the one I did I to him mention him to you

You didn't mention a name but you mentioned him

Yes I 've had my eye on him for for for some time 

Had my eye on him since the beginning of the year really 

But uhm  I decided that I really ought to be wise for months and months and months and  not uh  ask lecturers out 

Right

Uh huh

So much for that 

So uhm  eventually a couple of weeks ago I plucked up my courage and  rang him up

and said uhm  well first of all I said listen you 've got to pretend you don't know who it is on the telephone

And he said but it 's Isabel

I said no no no

Can you pretend you don't know who it is 

I said I 've just phoned you to ring you up and discuss the ethics of whether students should invite their lecturers out to see films 

And he said that sounds like a good idea  



Ah ha

So uhm  so my uh so I was uh 

Bravery won the day 

Ah ha ha

So this is for Yibin then

Sorry

This uh linguistics stuff 

Yes yes

That 's what he  that 's how he earns his keep  doing linguistics 

So uhm

So he 's going to punch the details into a  screen 

Well  if there 's anything if there 's anything in one of the letters that I think is vaguely chatty I 'm obviously David I 'm not going to give him any of the personal stuff am I 

Or do whatever he needs to do

I don't know

I I mean I don't mean

I 

I don't know you know 

how do you stop your eyes reading what they 're reading 

No no no

No

Of course I 'll send you know I 'll send it to you

I really don't mind  Yibin using them

Because

No listen listen listen

No

No but listen

What I when I thought of it now I thought there 's couple of  the the letters that are very personal and anyway won't be interesting or relevant 

The ones that the ones that 'll be interesting will be will be the chatty ones

I 'm particularly thinking of the ones that I wrote to you way back when we were strangers  of of me sitting saying  well here I am

it 's eight fifteen and I 'm very impressed because I 'm already at Hendon Central  and the the apple blossoms are out

And here comes the Northern Line

And goodness me don't you wish you were here

Uhm

Yeah

 Yeah those 

Those things that are written in a very nineteen nineties type style of of disobeying every single thing that one ever knew about how to write a letter

Yeah

That 's why I think that they 're interesting because they 're not they 're not written to any kind of format

they 're just like a chain of consciousness

Yeah

Yeah

And uhm how are you

And why is the man opposite me picking his nose

Uhm

Yeah

But it 's a horrible job to do

It doesn't matter does it

I served milk at the ball  and Pimms and things

That was perfectly all right 

Yeah

I know that

But it 's a different thing in a in a pub El

True

you get nasty people but

Well you might do 

I mean though The Dog in Dulwich is really nice but that 's not the point

No

Oh I don't know 

I don't know

Anyway would you necessarily get the job 

No

But of course I suggest it casually and I get blown down in flames

Uhm

Are you actually going to bother getting a job 

Well not for the next two weeks probably

I mean I 'll ask in some places in Bromley

but I mean if I 'm going away in two weeks and they can't

I mean I don't know for sure if it will be that soon but you know you can't really say

But afterwards  I will 

Mm 

Probably but I 've got to do like

Uhm I might go back to Cambridge early or something because I 've got to write an extended essay 

What

is that for the competition

Well yeah but it 's just to keep my hand in essay-writing

We 've all been told to do it

And Joe refuses to do it 

And as I say I don't know about the other two but I 'm going to do one

Mm

Oh shame

Yeah

Yeah

And I 've got like loads of texts to read

So I 've been told I 've got to do a a month o o a month of reading  

so I 'll do that in September 

Oh that 's horrible

Thank God I don't have to do any at the moment

I was going to say and who is fancy free wearing her tap shoes

Tap shoes 

Well

Yeah

What tap shoes

No that 's just an image of freedom and party-going

I see what you mean yes 

Well

Yes I mean the trouble is I really thought oh you know brilliant when I 've finished my deadline and everything  uhm I 'll go out loads 

but all I want to do is completely collapse and just flop in front of the telly which is really boring 

I don't know

I think sort of intellectually completely boring you know 

I mean I went out with Joey and Lee on Monday evening



Sorry

You really tired

Yeah

Oh how 's Lee

Well he 's OK uhm  uh

Did he get that job about teaching English

Well it wasn't a job

it was a course

He did the Tefl course the teaching English as a foreign language

Oh right

Yeah

Uhm 

Yeah I mean he 's OK

He 's just always so depressed and and and  uhm  you know complaining and  miserable about everything

Yeah  and he really likes Joey but he thinks Joey 's a complete waster so that the evening was really strange you know



Uhm

Oh Joey as in Uts and Joey

Yes

Ah right

Sorry got you now

Yeah

And she is she s she spent the entire evening convincing her that Us Uts was desperately passionately in love with her  and it was uhm

Fatal 

Well I mean it 's

The thing is he was supposed to be coming over for her birthday coming back for her birthday  uh because he 's over there now 

And uh she hadn't seen him for nine months or something

Her birthday 's in May 

And he phoned and yes he was going to get a f a a standby flight  and he never turned up

So she managed to get hold of his Dad who 's living over here you know in Montague Terrace 

And uh  he said oh yes you know Uts is uhm

He w he wasn't able to get a standby flight and uhm  it 's really difficult and he 'll have to wait till he goes via South Korea or something

And she swallowed every word of it

and I mean the thing it 's so obvious that he 'd uh  that he was putting her off  you know

And she said oh when I come back he won't recognise me

I 'm an independent woman now and all the rest of it 

I said I said to her you know without being crushing  have you thought that perhaps he  won't like the new you you know perhaps that he liked the fact that you were so dependent on him

Oh no he 'll like me

Oh

Uhm uhm

Uhm

Oh

Yeah

Mm

Don't know what she sees in him anyway but there you go

Oh no qui quite

I mean I you know I shared a flat with him for over a year

I know I know him in and out

you know I mean uhm well yeah

Yeah

Well 

Uhm

But anyway 

Oh dear

So

No no no

You will groove

The party still goes on

Yeah well I 'm

I mean it 's all quite depressing really because I phoned Harriet up to go out

and I don't know if Mum told you but she told me her Mum has cancer 

So I mean we 're still going out

But I mean that 's not exactly  uhm you know

Yes she said but

No

Yeah

But that 's 

I didn't know whether to push her or not but she she did seem to want to go so we 're going to go out

You don't want to come to a play tomorrow do you

Yeah



Oh what

I 'm going to uhm 

Fiona as you know does set design

she 's just finishing this course and she 's done the set design for a play up in Islington in a in a pub called the Red Lion

Oh y

I think I 've been there actually

You might 've done

it 's quite a  uhm well-known one

Yeah I think I might have done

It 's called Where Rai

Uhm I can't remember what it 's called

Yeah

The play

Graceland n or something

Yeah

Something to do about America

it might not have anything to do with America

it 's by an Irish guy called  Antoine O'Flaherty or something

Antoine

Yes

I don't know quite

But oh wait a minute

What what

Laura



Cutcombe

Mum says has Cutcombe got two Os in or one

No

Just the one

Just one



D' you know what she means



Oh apparently that 's all all right  



Yes

It 's Karen 's address

She 's sending her a card

Oh right

Yeah 

I 've ju

Oh that 's brilliant about Karen though

I know

It 's lovely isn't it

Say congratulations from me

Yes I will do

Yes I will do uhm

Only Mum 's sending a card from all of us anyway

Yes

Well that 's fair enough

Yeah

I 'm seeing Karen

Well Karen and Andre are coming round for dinner after Simon 's exams so it 's sort of  something like two weeks on Thursday or something uhm

Yeah yeah

Oh that 's the other thing

I suppose you 've got to wait for his exams

But yeah there you go

Yeah 

But it was weird actually uhm at King 's because in the third year there 's there 's

You know that guy who died the rower  and he was uhm very pally with Jim the third year classicist  and another girl a classicist called Camilla a third year

And they said that they couldn't celebrate at all because they just had that hanging over them

and they felt they had no right whatsoever no cause to celebrate basically so



Yeah

Yeah

Mm

No

I think you would feel like that wouldn't you

Yeah

And they a they all of them didn't feel like doing their exams because he died like the night before a lot of uh the exams 

And uhm they said they they just wanted to go and sort of talk about that and they had no interest in their exams whatsoever so

Oh God

Mm mm

Uh I mean to be fair I think people will take this into consideration you know if they know somebody 

Not to to any great extent but they might bear it in mind

You don't know

Yeah

Yeah

Were they just first years 

Uhm no no

The these all the people who were friends are in the third year because he was a uhm a graduate

No

So it was part twos and threes uhm

Oh part threes uh

Tw part twos rather 

Uhm yeah they 're they 're final year 

But anyway 

Yeah

Uhm

Uhm

Have you heard from anyone from college 

No

I 've got to phone Liz because she said she was going to phone me  on uh Monday night but she hasn't

So either she hasn't gone home or else she 's lost her my address

We 're sort of both reasonably vague so 

And I gave it to her in the street on the back of a plastic bag 

I know

Monday



Uhm

Oh no

She 's bound to have lost it

Yeah

So I 'll phone her

And uhm  yeah because we 've got to sort out that



He 's no good honestly

No

And apart from that I mean my results are supposed to have come out today 

Uhm









Crap for dinner 

Well we forgot to get anything out of the f icebox  so

Oh I see

Wa oh it 's so funny

Simon 's on this revision course and I asked him to get some veg on the way home from Shepherd 's Bush market because he 's right there  and it 's much cheaper than the local shop

And we 'd run out as you can imagine

And uhm  so what does he do 

he comes back without any

I said oh oh typical you didn't go

And he said oh no I did go  but they were they were wrapping them up in uhm newspaper

And he didn't have a plastic bag  so he didn't get any 

Yeah

Couldn't he hold it under his arm

Well you would 've thought so wouldn't you but 

 Maybe he forgot and that 's an excuse

Maybe maybe but uh

Silly boy 

Yeah

Yes

I don't know

No

Oh Delia 's funny as well

She uhm 

You know that painting she did for me for my birthday the green thing

Oh yeah

That 's really nice

Yeah

She phoned me up uhm yesterday when I was at work

And she said oh oh you know panic panic panic

I 've got this uhm exhibition coming up

and I haven't got enough time to do enough paintings

Can I borrow yours 

Oh good news yeah

So I said yeah of course you can 

So I 've got a blank wall now 

Excellent yes because it 's quite big isn't it if I remember

No it 's not

it 's uhm maybe a foot square at the most  including the frame including the frame square

But she 's put it in a posher frame and she says I can keep the frame as as compensation 

Oh it 's not

Oh not bad then

Yeah

Oh excellent

So that is good news

Yes yes

Ginny oh uh I told you yeah

Don't worry

No

I was going to tell you Ginny 's got engaged but you knew that anyway



What

Yes

I knew that

Everybody 's doing it

I know

It 's boring

isn't it really

Yeah

Somebody else has as well

Who else has

Oh no some people from well girl from my school Ruth Osborne with the blond fuzzy hair

Do you remember Ruth Osborne

She looked like Karen 

Who

Oh yes

I do

Yes

The one that looked so like Karen it was unbelievable

Yeah

Well that was ages ago

That was over Christmas I think that happened

Uh

No but it 's been out this week

I 'll save it for you 

It frightened the life out of me

In pubs they say that  you know they can only say about twenty per cent of the glasses are dirty  and it 's not the m publican 's fault always

it 's his staff

Ah that 's nice of you

Uhm

Uhm uhm 

Anyhow I won't go into all that

That puts one off

So that 's all it was

So after we actually did Islington it it sort of fell in Canonbury it fell into place and they got quite excited about the Elizabethan side of it 

Yeah

Who actually went

What

Who actually went

Oh uh Fiona  uhm  June Seddon  and uhm  Caroline 

Yeah

Oh yes yes

Do I know her

New girl

Oh no but she 's ever so very nice

Oh no no no

Is she

What does she do

Yes

She 's a friend of Rosine 

Oh yes

Oh I don't know Rosine very well because she  uhm started there the minute I left

Well you see uh Rosine couldn't come but she wants to come on

You see

So that 's why it doesn't matter to me the whole series

Uhm I 'm so used to taking gangs around Islington

Yeah

No no

Yes very kind of you you know so nice

Yes

Oh well I love Canonbury you see so it 's no effortless for Canonbury 

And of course I always wax poetic about it to you and  

But you never hear me waxing poetic to the Marxist Republic

it doesn't  

I never ever admit anything there but it really is uh better than any other borough in London to my way of thinking

I know

Yeah

Oh yeah uhm



Of course not

Yeah

It it is lovely

I mean I don't know much about it yet  but uhm

No

I think you will agree because they were they were dumbfounded

And June said kept saying I had no idea

And Caroline said and I had no idea

You know

Everywhere we we passed I pointed out things but they

These features is what I wanted I think are fascinating  that they 'd remained

I mustn't talk about it now but 

Yeah yeah

Uhm

Oh did you all go into work afterwards

Yes

Yeah yes

Well that 's lovely a

a mass trip 



Yes

It was

They said this is so healthy

Yeah yeah

It sounds great fun

The others said that uh

The others Anne wanted to come and uhm 

Anyhow it doesn't matter

 so I think some others felt that you know they 'd not been left out but

I said well look it 's always there and Rosine wants to come 

So

But I thought that

Anyhow you and Harriet know one another

 she 's going to bring her boyfriend

Yeah

Yeah

Oh yeah

Yeah

Oh Jonathan

He 's going to go

Oh yes he wants to come yes

That 's brilliant

You know her Mum 's not well don't you

Well no I don't like to ask her but

Well you see I didn't know about it Mary

Didn't you 

No I phoned her up uhm must be couple of evenings ago now

And

Uh Monday or Tuesday anyway 

And I said oh hi how are you all the rest of it because I haven't spoken for a few weeks because of my  work and everything yeah 

and uh she 's not the best correspondent actually you know

She doesn't get on the phone at the slightest provocation 

Anyway of course I was uhm 

She sounded a bit down 

And uhm she suddenly said oh my Mum 's not well

And I said oh dear Harriet thinking oh you know she 's got the flu or something

And she said oh no she 's got cancer 

So uhm

Ah

Oh yes yes that yes

Yes but she had the op you see

Uhm

Didn't progress after that 

And uh then when I asked her she burst into tears 

And I said look you 're not to cry 

I said in front of your mother don't you

Not to ever break down because if she 's going to fight it

No

Ah

Oh

Uhm

No

She 's got to have

Yes yes

Yes

She 's got to have strength

So we all told her that but 

And I 'm frightened to ask her in case it you know

I 'll wait

I 'll bring it up when she 's on her own

Yes

Well sh

Uhm

She said to me uhm uh the other day that she wasn't eating very much and the doctors had said not to encourage her to 

Ah 

So it didn't sound too good does it

No it doesn't

No

Oh what a shame

Yeah

But you know Jonathan 's been a brick I 'm glad to hear because  well he wasn't sure

He said to me oh I don't know if I 'm in the way

when you know when she comes back she needs to pour it out but I don't know if I 'm in the way 

But I said to him look he said she said to me  uhm I don't know what I 'd 've done without Jonathan you know

He 's a real brick

I can lean on him you know 

So I think he 's he 's been you know

I mean he phoned me up the next day to talk to me about it because I think he couldn't quite  cope yeah

Oh that 's good

Ah  yes 

Yes

That 's good

he 's got you to confide in

Yes yeah

Oh that 's good

So he had a secret phone call with me you know

Just just uh just uh  I think he just needs to talk to someone really

Yes

He does

No you do you see you have to ask people and find out what 's the best uhm uh method or uh uh the best action to take  but it they do  because she seems much more stable as it were

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah

Uhm

Does she

Yes because she didn't burst out

Ooh she was in a terrible state

She looked ill a couple of times 

and she 's had this sort of uhm  uhm 

Well I don't know what it is

a minor flu isn't it

Uhm

Uhm

Ah

Yeah

Yeah yeah well she 's run down I expect

Yes and the worry does pull one down  and uhm it 's been a bit difficult there at times you know  so

Uhm

Uhm uhm

They

I think her Da uhm

Jonathan said because they 're very Greek you know she he said they 've been quite sort of emotional about it

and uhm  uhm I don't quite know what he meant

but I

You know not British in other words

so I don't quite know what they meant he meant but

Yeah yeah

Yes

No 

Latin more Latin 

Oh they do

they take it all terribly seriously there 

You know the fate of the gods you know 

Uhm uhm

Ah yeah he said something about that yeah

Oh yes 

Whatever people say I 've noticed they 're distinctly different

And the Greek Orthodox  uhm they 're more keen than the Russian Orthodox   you know

in lots of things they go right over the 

I 've noticed that with Lisa who 's Russian Orthodox 

My my sister-in-law yes yes yes

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Yeah

Yes yes

Is she

Oh how interesting though

Uh

But uhm

However 

So uh we leave at

Because you see something may happen and Harriet can't come so don't worry

any old time

But she did say that date

Now while they were out with me uh we passed something or other

and I there were leaflets on the Canonbury Festival or at least Camden Passage Festival 

And uhm they took them

And then I I was away in Ely yesterday with the V and A

It 's wonderful Ely Cathedral

Well yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

Ah

Yes

Oh lovely yes

With the wi with the friends you mean

Oh it was fabulous

Yes

Yeah

And we had a curator  in charge of the stained glass  fantastic

Oh lovely

It is a beautiful place

Yes

Oh he is marv marvellous

Michael Archer

I don't know whether you know him  

He 's very enthusiastic about it

I think he fires us too  and uhm

That was wonderful

Well I I don't know I

I did lose my cool once

Yeah

No I don't

Yes

Did you

Why  

What did you do

Well well how shall I say 

Uhm 

Well first of all we went to Ely

We went to several little churches to see them  which were untouched over the years

It was fantastic 

And in Ely uhm we had a wonderful guide

He got so excited about it

He was French of French origin

He kept coming back to this because of the Norman the Norman influence which is so terrific

and it 's outstanding there

and i i i it is even if anything better than the later Romanesque as he calls it 

And oh I agreed with him in a sense you know thinking

And he gave us a picture of how it was used how you entered the cathedral  as a pilgrim as uh in other words  uhm local uhm peasants 

They were all brought in there  and how they entered what they did

And so we followed as one of th uh one of them

and then he pointed out features which are so unique there 're none like it in the world

Yeah

Yeah yeah

Yeah

Yeah yeah

Uhm

Yes

Uhm uhm

So there was

Having said that he brought us to we knew this was the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance he comes to the Lady Chapel now

You see what  uhm Alan of uhm Walsingham did

Something happened in there

And when we went in he said everything about it all the light in the world all the sense of you know  uh reality of that time how they were saved by

There 'd been some subsidence or some terrible storm that 'd uhm uh demolished part of this the tower

The original

So then he built this on  as a sort of  thanksgiving you might say 

and it was breath-taking

I 'd never been in the Lady Chapel

It was huge

The light was absolutely

Well however the windows were marve marvellous

Everything was marvellous but  there were no statues 

And so that was all right

but uh uhm in the centre of the room almost

It was huge

The Lady Chapel was huge

Uh there was this concoction that the Americans had put there 

and it was for peace uhm throughout the world from different nationalities

But it was n

Uh you know you looked at it and thought oh yes the Americans have done this tapestry  uh pageant uh pageant in needlework on it

and you had to  something to do

Sew this ribbon of peace you know so  that was all right

It was in the centre there 

and I had listened to him 

and he went through his very exact

He was very exact

He was uh masterly at it  and he said uhm and  made it pleasant and lots of uhm  lots really of humour

Yes yeah

Yeah

Yes

Ah

No

Oh

Yeah

Yeah

Oh



Yes yes uhm

Yes uhm

Uhm uhm

Distinctly brilliant I thought him

So he said  basically you will see all the something like thirty-seven statues that should fit in those niches  have all been torn out he said  at the time of the Reformation 

And there wasn't one

He said there was a huge one

He gave us the height  of uh  uh Our Lady on the central altar

and he described all her garb because it was written by somebody one of these scribes with a golden crown

and it went through everything

It must 've been very imposing

If you saw that window it must 've been breath-taking 

and then he said so that all the  uhm peasants could come in and understand you know because they couldn't read or write

So

I understand that

but they had statues  or symbols  because they couldn't

They were inarticulate too you see

So they had to look at something

You couldn't talk to them  about religion

you had to have something to show them 

Yeah

Yes yes

Uhm uhm

Yes

Yes yes

No

No

Yeah yeah

They couldn't have been that thick but still 

Ah

You 're still thinking about it

Yeah

What is it

money or  lack of will power or

Oh well uh  no

neither

Well

Well money obviously I mean

I never have any  but uh 

No it 's just a matter of getting round to it I suppose 

Good

good

Yeah

Yes

Ye yes

Been doing anything interesting there

Uhm

Not really uhm 

No I 'm kind of working mainly

I 'm afraid yeah last week 's cricket was cancelled because

No

Ah

How 's that

Yeah

Opposition didn't have enough players

You should have insisted it went ahead 

Yeah

yeah

If they 'd only had five we 'd 've stood a good chance

Well exactly

Uhm

Yeah

Lend them a couple of one-legged children or something you know

Yeah

Wha what was the test score at the end

Oh  two thirty-one for four

And  who

I know Morris got forty-four 

What did what did Gooch end up with

Yeah

Uh sixty

Yeah 

Upton the usual

Uh zilch

Yeah

Yeah

Well he had an absolute beast of a ball

Really

A sort of thrown-high bouncer fourth ball I think

He actually managed to get a boundary then

did he

Well 

I mean he was just trying to get anything on it

Yeah

I mean because

I mean it 's not that  it 's a lot

Uh I don't think the pitch is actually that fast

It 's a hell of a lot faster than anything else

Yeah

And Morris had to have a take a new helmet at one point

Really

Yeah

Oh bloody hell 

The ball went straight through his defences uh

Yeah

Clobbered the side of his  face

Yeah

Snapped one

Ooh 

So who who else got any 

Ramprakash twenty-five

Oh what a surprise 

As usual  

Smith  uh

He 's not out and he 's got just over fifty

Yeah

And Stewart nineteen not out

Ah

But Hooper bowled what sixteen overs at the end

Really

Because they were going so slowly it was unbelievable

What

they were over eight

Yeah

Yeah

Mind you I mean there were  few hold-ups for the magic spray 

Yeah

Uh  but uh well still pretty slow

Yeah

And as I say Richards has been quite negative and they  cut off all the scoring shots

Well I think they

I mean they

I think they did pretty well to get to  end up like that

Yeah

Yeah yeah it 's it 's not bad if if they can get a you know somebody can get a score tomorrow

Yeah

Though I suppose the  the best chance is s Smith isn't it

Smith to go on yeah

Yeah

But uh 

Yeah

So I think they 're they 've  put in a pretty pretty good effort  as good as they can hope for really I think 

Uh it 's very difficult

I mean there were four byes over Dujon 's head

Yeah

Yeah

Oh my God yeah

Which I 

Uh do you want a quick word with Mum 

Yep OK

As I say best of uh  luck with the   pass

don't worry about it

No I I wasn't really worrying about it because I mean if it if I pass it 'll be a bonus but I 'm  you know I 'm quite expecting to fail so uhm

No 

Yeah

Well

Yep 

OK I 'll just hand you over

OK

Okeydokey

Right I 'll see you sometime

Yep see you bye

Yes yes

Well I mean it 'll be a bottle of something highly alcoholic you know yeah you know one- or-two-words

Yes yes

Well when do you actually expect the results

Uh uh

I always make it with stock myself but

Yeah he did rather

It shouldn't

It looked like it should 've been an R S F there doesn't didn't it but uh 

But obviously he carried on and and won

Yeah

Yeah well all credit to the lad 

I can't really see him hitting the big big time though

His heart doesn't seem to be in it

Yeah you know

No no

I mean he 

Right

OK

Yep

D' you

Under-chef

Yes

OK

Right I 'll see you

Right

Right

See you 

Right

That seems to 've been uh accomplished

Accomplished

Uhm

Oh ho so you you 're the under-chef are you

Oh yes very definitely

Oh yes

Well  so Giles says anyway

Well yes

That means he took one lamb burger out of there  from under the grill

Phoo

That must 've been 

Two sorry  

Two two

That 's uh

Must be pretty tough 

Yeah 

Yes

Is uh  Giles being energetic about life at the moment

Oh very yes yeah

Very

Yes uh 

He seems to 've got things set up for the next year so

Yeah

I suppose actually it isn't too long till he has to go is it

No no

I mean uh what 's it

the beginning of September

Yep

Yeah

Yeah

Yes so

I gather nobody can drag you away on holiday

Is that right

Yeah 

Well uh  Jo my boss is away  at the moment and I I 've got an audit deadline on August the thirty-first

Yeah

Oh dear

Oh that 's all right 

And it 's

First two weeks in September

Ah but my colleague Paul is going away for those two weeks in September

Good Lord you are indispensable 

Yeah well I am when other people are on holiday

Yes

Well of course other people have holidays don't they  

Yeah but the problem was that having had that  that period of uhm having had those three weeks off to do the exams  then other people booked their holidays so I 've got to wait until everybody else has kind of come back  before I get anything  which is a 

Well I mean it would be nice to have a holiday but uh

Yeah yeah

Yeah

Yes

Yeah

I 'm sure it would 

I think you uh

Well I don't know

I think I always feel I 'd like to get away from the place for a bit

Yeah

Although I did have three weeks in sunny Shepherd 's Bush of course

Well yes but that was hardly a holiday was it

No not really no



You may think it wasn't three weeks very well spent

Well no no not really

But uh  could 've been yeah better ways of spending it you know like the South of France

Yeah

yeah

Well a anyway give us uh you know a call when uh  when uh you know

Yeah I will 

Yes and uh

Oh incidentally have you written to Grandma 

Have I written to Gra

Well I would suggest that you sort of write or speak with Grandma  uhm

Before I see Grandma

Before you see Grandma

Right

Because she 's still wondering  why you haven't acknowledged whatever it was she last sent you

The postal service is terrible  isn't it

Yes

Well I did tell her you 've been working awfully hard

I have

And that you hadn't telephoned me either so

I see 

Right yes yes

I shall

Oh well 

I shall I shall contact Grandma yes

Yeah

I I would if I were you

Yeah



Right right

Right

Otherwise I 'll be cut off from the family inheritance

Otherwise

Yes I should think so

Oh right 

Did I tell you

The lot of course

Pardon

I I mean I haven't forgotten that you haven't telephoned me either

Oh right I 

My goodness



Your future looks bleak I 'm afraid

It does does rather doesn't it yes yes

Well I mean you know just remember who 's going to look after you when you grow old



Sunset homes of course

The local D S S I expect 

Formerly known as the workhouse

uh I think there 's no no workhouse any more

No no

But uh  it 's called the street I think

 Yeah

Right OK then love so I 'll hear from you at the beginning of next week

Yeah OK

 hope it all goes well before long

Yep

OK then

Yeah

Yep

All right

OK

Bye bye then love

Bye

Bill Lewis here

Hi

Hi

How 's things

OK

How are you

I hear we 're doing a a gig together

Yeah

Looks like it

But I I didn't realise that

That was good 

I wasn't looking forward to doing it but I am now 

It 's going to be good

Yeah

So what have you been up to

Yeah

Uhm

Ah right

uhm oh God uhm buried under a couple uhm playwriting commissions uhm  which are  are driving currently driving me a bit potty 

Well one of them is

Right

Oh right

What are they about

Sorry

What are they about I mean

uhm well uh one of them 's a a a play which is the one I 'm sort of trying to finish at the moment is a a play for a company called Quicksilver

It 's actually the second play I 've written for them uhm  which is kind of based on the uhm the Browning poem the Pied Piper

It 's sort of about dreams and possibilities inside a mountain

But uh the problem is I 've kind of I started with fantasy and uhm and uh I don't think I 'll ever try that again

I I think unless you with uhm with something real  it 's uhm you you you end up having too many possibilities open to you and it just uhm it becomes a bit of a kind of a  uhm a fantastically complicated mind maze really 

But uhm anyway I 'm uh I 'm just about uh seeing the light at the other side at the moment but it 's taken me a hell of a long time 

And the other is uhm

I don't know if heard of a company called Monstrous Regiment

uhm

uhm

uhm

No

I don't know much about the theatre

The theatre

Right

Well I 'm I 'm writing a a play for them

So uhm  so I 've kind of  been doing that

I did I did a bit of storytelling for uhm a shadow puppet theatre company from September to December which was really nice 

And uhm  that 's all I 've been doing really 

Been pretty busy 

How about you

uhm

uhm

Well I 've  I 've changed what I 've been doing uhm 

I kind of kind of see myself as a writer these days

Uh I don't know exactly what I 'm doing exactly

Uh it 's very difficult to explain

I I joined a group about uhm  over a year ago now  uh called A School for Prophets  which is uhm  uhm Prophets not Profits  uh which is based in Warmsley which is quite near  us in Chatham

It 's run by a Catholic priest called Bert White 

And the group 's all  ecumenical

uhm mainly Catholic because it was started by Bert but it 's got all kinds of other things connected to it

And we 've been examining well uh things like Matthew Fox who 's a a theologian who 's been incredibly liberating 

And uhm there 's a whole sort of movement happening in this country called creation-centred spirituality

It 's not a cult or anything

It 's just where people that have particular views on spirituality are actually sort of coming together not necessarily Christians 

Uh and it kind of the sane end of the New Age really   because there are lots of things I think that are in in the New Age that are actually quite sensible uhm and quite positive but there 's also a lot of nutty stuff as well 

uhm  and that 's basically it

But we 've we 've had a some a very interesting year

We meet every Tuesday uhm and last year we had people like Sidney Carter come down and do some stuff with us uhm

We had uhm  stuff on liberation theology and stuff on feminist theology 

And uh  we had Julie Felix come down and do some stuff for us a few weeks ago

uhm

uhm

uhm

uhm

uhm

uhm

uhm uhm

Right

Alastair 's in there

Sorry 

Oh yeah 

D' you know why the name 's really familiar

Why do I know it

She was a folk singer in the sixties

She did it on television

She had long sort of dark hair  and she was half Mexican  

And she came down and uhm 

Oh it 's been a quite an interesting in quite an interesting year

Well Bert 's now the priest who runs it

he 's gone off to the Philippines and he 's back on Tuesday

And we 're now going into a second phase which is starting with a magazine 

We want a magazine that uh  with quite a wide brief on it

But the idea is that uhm  it 's a magazine that 's going to be a kind of forum for a lot of the things that are happening

uhm we 've got uhm

uh it 's called Paradigm Shift because we will be examining the paradigm shift that 's actually occurring 

uh so we 've got a whole lot of uh clergy scientists poets  artists all kinds of people involved in it 

And uhm it 's going to one thing it 's going to do is to foster a whole sort of new generation of grass roots creative intellectuals which would be partly one of the things I see happening  but also to examine paradox 

And uhm  I 've been put in charge of editing this magazine

And I 'm preparing the first issue at the moment

uh we 've got so far we 've got an article by John Medcalf who 's uhm  written a lot of books about Nicaragua and Peru

He was in N both of those countries as a Catholic priest

uh we 've got uhm a woman called Caitlin Matthews who is a pagan priestess a K of a Celtic  persuasion

uhm she 's written seventeen books so far on Celtic mysteries uh Arthurian legends uhm  all kinds of stuff feminism the feminine aspect of God

Her last one was called Sophia the Feminine Aspect of Godness

It 's she 's uh published by Harper Rowe

They 're quite amazing sort of stuff

Anyway she 's uh she 's given us an article for free which is good

It 's such a long one I can spread it over two issues  which is good

So Sidney Carter 's promised something Julie Felix is going to write something for us uhm and also Richard Solly from CAFNNA who we who who is loosely connected with the group but may become closer to it

He that 's Catholic Action for Native North Americans 

he does a lot of work for

He was with the Cheyenne and the Navaho  Mohawk and the  people and he does a lot of liberation theology stuff with them 

So it 's it 's sounding quite interesting

uhm  uh I want to get some more  uh kind of right brain stuff into it

it was you know  literature and poetry 

uhm  wou do you think maybe in the future you could envisage doing a story for us 

Oh right 

yeah 

yeah 

yeah 

right 

right 

yeah

Right

uhm

uhm

uhm

uhm

Yeah

Right

uhm

Right

uhm

Great

Right

uhm

Right

uhm yeah possibly

Yeah but  uhm now at the moment we 're not paying but when Bert gets back I 'm going to ask him if I can have like some smallish like fees so that we can at least pay writers because they are struggling and what have you 

I was thinking about thirty or forty quid or something like that

Yeah 

The kind the type of story that I 'm actually looking for

uhm  I like things that are real  uhm and I like things that are quite strong 

but  I like things also with a fantastic element to them  so they stretch the imagination a bit  which is what I 've always liked about the best writing from Gabriel Garcia Marquez because he his best work is really when he sets things in the real world 

uh and yet there 's always this element of mystery and the fantastic in amazing events happening 

D' you think you could manage something like

I think you probably could

uhm uhm

uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

uhm

uhm

uhm uhm

I could have a go uhm 

Yeah

I mean you know I 'd I 'd I 'd love to I 'd dearly love to uh you know to be spending time writing poetry and fiction

And kind of this last year 's been been uhm  kind of commissioned work which which in one sense is I guess on paper

looks great

the fact that I 'm actually getting getting work like that

but uhm in another sense it 's very sort of stultifying because uhm you tend to sort of  write for other people and and and do very much what they want which uhm is is very difficult

So I mean you know uhm I 'm I 'm really hoping to clear some space in my life very soon to be able to do all that

So uhm  uhm at the moment I can't I can't really sort uhm int

Yeah

I 've kind of got to to just uhm reach reach reach the top really of all this

That would be brilliant

Oh obviously if you 're doing this

Yeah

 I 've got a list out for the spring issue 

I 've got enough stuff for the summer issue 

I 'm looking really towards the autumn

Right

Right

To the autumn

Yeah

Well that would be about the right time for me so uhm

We 've been doing it sort of quarterly

But the thing is uhm  Ann and myself hopefully are going to be in in America in  the end of Ju uh July and all of August  because uhm I 'm trying to sort of go and meet some people out there and uh  and network with them 

So  uh if you wanted to do something I 'm looking for between six hundred and eight hundred words but I will stretch to a thousand

Right

Yeah

Right

So quite short

Quite short

Yeah

I 'm I 'm sho I 'm you know that that would be quite nice uhm nice little challenge really

I want something that 's really mysterious and uh uh magical  but real 

That 's the thing I 'd like

I 'd like it in this world

you know I 'd like to

And I 'd like to deal with any issues you want to deal with that are you feel are liberating you know and progressive

So you know we 've got 

I think yeah the magazine 's going to be quite important because I don't

There are magazines that are like out there for intellectuals and unfortunately academics 

There are also uh magazines that are in the New Age and there are also Christian magazines but there 's nothing that 's actually cutting between the three 

And we 're hoping like to do stuff on holistic medicine uhm the new physics

In fact I think a number of scientists that we think might be interested in contributing as well because  we went to see when Matthew Fox came over we went up to Cardiff and heard him speak on  uhm  uh what was it now uh Celtic spirituality 

And when you think in Cardiff you know there were seven hundred people in this thing  and they were over that uh when he came to Saint James uh  when he was with Rupert Sheldrake who 's uh a biologist

And it was called the talk was The Greening of Science and Religion and that Rupert Sheldrake is a one of the leading sort of biologists

And he was he has this morphic morphic resonance theory that is kind of turning a lot of scientists '  world upside down apparently and the way we learn things 

And so that was great

And you had a scientist up there talking about pilgrimages and uh   and uh uh the possibility of angels

And then you had a theologian talking about the Big Bang   which I thought was brilliant

uh it 's been really amazing the things and I really think there 's a change going on in the in the way people do see things 

So I 'm much more positive about that

My own career of course has gone right down the tube but there you go

uhm  but then I 'm I 've I 've learnt to let that go a bit because there 's nothing I can do about it so

uhm

uhm

Yeah

uhm 

uhm

uhm

uhm

uhm

uhm

uhm

 Mm

uhm

uhm

Yeah

Well you sound a lot brighter than uh last time I heard you anyway so uh

Well yeah

I 've had

uh maybe there may be some way of of changing what I do and getting back into things but

uhm

uhm

Well I mean we you know we can have a chat on the twentieth when we see each other anyway 

uh it is the twentieth isn't it she says off the top of her head

OK then

Let 's wait

uhm uh no

It 's the fifteenth isn't it

Is it

Oh blimey

I 'm not sure

Hang on 

I 've got the fifteenth down

Oh yeah

I 've got a little I 've got a little sheet of paper somewhere and I 've also got my diary

I can triple check

Hello

Hi Leo sorry sorry

Have I got you out of the bath or or suchlike

Oh hi there

Hi

Uh  no

I was just cleaning my teeth

Oh right

Cleaning my teeth

OK

Hi hi

It 's John then

Did I say it was John

Did I

Hi

Hi

How are you

Sorry

No I rec you didn't

I recognised your voice

Oh right

Hi

Well how how 's it going

Uh well not too bad

I I 've finished my exams  so the

Well there were only two so uhm 

Uh there was one on Wednesday and one on uh Thursday last week 

So the whole course and and  and everything 's finished now 

And uh

Oh all of them

Uhm

What

everything

Sorry

Yes

Yeah

Everything the practical the written and the actual sort of input itself has all finished 

So what are you doing now

So

Well I 'm hanging around in Colchester for this week and next week 

And after next week I 'm going to go to Weymouth

Did I tell you that I was  going for a job in in Weymouth

No

Where is Weymouth

Uhm it 's near

do you know Bournemouth

It 's in Dorset  sort of south-west  ish

Yes

Right

It 's pretty dreary

Uhm

Well my parents lived in Bournemouth for a couple of years

Oh really

Uhm

Well Bournemouth 's quite a major town isn't it

Weymouth 's I think about a f

M ma major in what sense

In a sense of size and sort of uh and so on 

Y y well yeah maybe

But I mean I don't know about sort of culture or whatever

I 've never been there but

Uhm yeah I mean I suppose

I dunno don't know

My aunt 's been to Weymouth a few times and she likes it

But it I suppose it 's as a that 's as a sort of holiday  kind of doing you know doing nothing but sitting around

No

Uhm

And how long are you there for

Well seven weeks

Uhm it 's but it 's good though because it 's uhm uhm I 've got a job as a course director  which is a sort of step up you know from teacher 

And uhm so that 's quite good you know

Is that is that the thing that you 'd qualified yourself to be

Uh aiming to be yeah

Yeah yeah

Yeah that 's right

And one of the things one of the things I 'm trying to sort of get into

Yeah

Yeah

I want to sort of you know I just want to kind of progress basically from  sort of just being a teacher into that kind of thing and also writing materials and just syllabus design and that kind of stuff

Yeah

Uhm

But you kn you know when we were teaching together a couple of years ago and there was a w I think a woman called Margaret

is she a course director

Yeah yeah

That 's right

Yeah

Yeah

Uh yeah yeah yeah 

Well that was a hellish job 

Yeah

It 's very daunting

Yeah 

But it 's a real first step on the ladder sort of thing

But uhm d d do you get paid decently

Uhm the pay 's OK

I mean it 's in terms of 

Well the u the  basic pay is uhm about fifteen hundred and fifty for seven weeks  uhm which works out at about just over two twenty a week right

so it isn't

Is that is that net or gross

Th that 's gross

So that 's not very much

But if you count like accommodation and food on top of that that brings it up to about  you know maybe two hundred and sixty a week

Well how how do you mean

Do you get free accommodation

Yeah

Free accommodation

Yeah 

Yeah

Ah

Oh right

So uhm so that 's not too bad

it 's

And

So what 's two twenty  uhm  d d

deduct about seventy quid off that

Three quarters

For me the the basic rate is uh I 'll

I 'll end up with eleven hundred and sixty-eight 

So that 's about a hundred and fifty a week a bit less

Yeah yeah

Well that 's pretty good if you 're not paying rent out of it

Oh yeah

It 's OK

Yeah

I mean it could be better

I mean the actual sort of payment for the job could be better but in terms of actual money coming in yeah it 's not too bad at all

Uhm

Uhm

And you what you 're going there i when in a couple of weeks

In a couple

Well yeah uhm yeah a couple of weeks

just over a week and a half in fact

So are you going to be in London at all

Well it 's very very unlikely uhm because the other thing I 'm doing is try is trying to pass a driving test 

I 've got it it 's really hell uh cos I 've got to have these exams and like loads of assignment things to do plus doing driving lessons

And I 've hardly had a minute to sort of look at highway codes and driving manuals and stuff but it 's getting better

And I 've got a test next week so I kind of got to stay uhm hang around for that

Uhm so you you can drive can you

Uhm I 'm pretty getting  getting up to the point where I feel sort of fairly confident about the test

Yeah

I mean I don't I 'm still making sort of silly mistakes you know odd times but

But like I mean you can get into a car and make it move and things

God yeah

Oh right

I 'm driving all around Colchester and along sort of  country roads and in all kinds of traffic 

Yeah yeah  yeah

What

with an instructor

Christ amazing 

Well why

Most people learn to drive by the time they 're seventeen you know

Well not me

I mean it 's completely

Not me either but

I must say I have driven once  uhm in Australia uhm  and uhm

Yeah

With someone else 

In the car

Yeah

Yeah when I was driving

But I smashed off the gear box on a rock

What 

How did you do that

uhm well I wasn't driving well I was driving partly on the road but also i on through open country 

And uhm there was this rock in the path and uhm and I sort of assumed I could go over it and uhm and it in fact it just smashed a hole in the gear box 

I don't even know what a gear box is actually but I know I 'd I smashed a hole in it so the car didn't work any more 

Shit

Gosh

I haven't done anything like that thank God 

The worst I 've done is like 

why I can't think of anything that 's like approaching that really 

I s have I haven't even mounted the kerb or anything I don't think so far

Uhm

Well that sounds

I I mean I don't associate  you with uh you know one of these sort of skills like like driving

Well it 's kind of an essential though isn't it now

Right

But don't don't you even manage some eccentricity in in in executing it

We uhm  well well there 's a measure of incompetence 

There 's a measure of my sort of natural left-handedness you know that

that sort of enters into it 

But I 'm hoping to eradicate much of that by the time by the day of the test which is tomorrow week actually so I haven't got that much time left 

Got about another three lessons or so 

But my instructor 's pretty good 

Oh yeah

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

And so you 're not you 're not coming to London at all

Well I think it 's unlikely

The only time I could come is at the weekends 

But  uhm  the thing is I was hoping to sort of  sort of  visit some places around here and also some some people who uhm

Uhm

What

Colchester

Yeah

Well uh more than that Essex Suffolk uh

But but you 're not coming up much from Weymouth

Oh no no no n

What what

sorry I thought

I mean you 're going to stay all seven weeks in Weymouth

Oh yeah yeah

I 'll have to yeah yeah

But don't you get time off

Well I do

I mean I will do but not enough time to come up to London I shouldn't think unless I come up on an ex excursion

Oh no there aren't any excursions to London

Uhm it 's very unlikely

Do you fancy coming down to Weymouth 

Uhm

Well no  not really

I mean I did use to go down to Bournemouth

It was a terribly dreary dr journey

Yeah

Yeah yeah

It 's a long one as well actually 

Yeah

I mean I I

Uhm

S ah yes

No

Well yeah

Uh and so I mean where is when is uh when is nine weeks ' time

Where does that take us to



Nine weeks ' time is the middle of August

Now that now the middle of August  is uh

I mean I might still come up to London between now and next week

I don't know

I I 've still got to sort of decide what I want to do But uhm

but in August yeah uhm

Did did I tell you that I was c hoping to go to Japan to teach

Uhm

Uhm

Well no

It was a vague sort of

Oh right

Well it 's now definite  uhm and I I definitely want to go to Japan uhm until I uh 

Oh yeah

But no no

The desire is definite or you 've actually got a job

Oh the just the desire is definite

But it shouldn't be too difficult because there are always loads of jobs going

And between now and August  uhm  well I won't be able to come up to London for interviews because 

Uhm

And is Japan the one that doesn't like beards or long hair

So they say

Beards

Yes so they say

Yeah

They said uh apparently they don't mind long hair so much

It 's beards

But uhm  I just heard a couple of people saying that and I 've heard other people say it doesn't really matter so I really don't know

Oh by the way I 've got a beard now

Beards

Yeah

I know

I we I saw you at the poetry reading

Oh right

Yeah

Did I have a

Of course I did yeah

Right yeah

uhm yeah

I 'm kind of hovering on the verge of shaving it off anyway though 

Have you still got the handlebar moustache

Y oh yes

Yeah

uhm

But it 's kind of obscured by the beard really

It 's like uhm I mean it 's a sort of minor version of uhm you know Paul Vining 's moustache cum beard

So the moustache is very much a sort of bushy  sort of outgrowth

uhm v vaguely

I have a vague idea of his beard

Yeah

Yeah

Well it 's not pointed but it 's sort of bush

It 's long

I mean his moustache

I mean it 's long but it 's not sort of pointed

It goes to a bush at the end

And mine 's a bit like that cos I don't sort of wax it or anything

And basically it 's a sort of it 's a sort of abdication of the responsibility of shaving that I 'm most interested in rather than the aesthetic sort of quality of the the thing 

uhm

uhm

Yes

But it 's something to twiddle in your case

Am I right

Yes it is

Yeah

Yeah

uhm except that I I don't really I haven't really twiddled the moustache so much since I 've had the beard as well because somehow  like aft attention is taken away from it sort of thing

I mean when I just had the moustache it was very visible  and very much uh yes something to be twi

I 'm twiddling it now actually while as as you mention it uhm

But with the beard

uhm

But yes I 'm I 'm

I tend to sort of tug on the uhm on on the chin

Yes

I 'm I 'm doing that now actually

You 're you 're you 're a chin-tugger too

Just before you said that I was st started doing that

Yeah

Yeah

No no crises in your life recently

Not at the moment

It 's remarkably smooth at the moment would you believe it

How about you 

Thank God for that

Fine

Plain sailing yeah

Yeah

What

Plain sailing

Anyway it 's a possibility uh

It 's a good possibility

Is it still going

Good

Listen uh

Uh not no not really

Not worth it

Is it not

Not really no cos I live uh 

I have to back you know c Chalk Farm whatever at nigh on six

Oh 

Are you 

Cos I was going to suggest uh that we could go to your   humble abode

Well we could go there for about five minutes but then I have to leave again

Cos I I 'd have I 'd have to leave before six to get to uh Old Hill 

Oh really

Is that all

Oh

Oh all right 

I I 'm flattered that you like it so much but unless you want to come round to it at about uh half nine by the time I get back at the other end

Oh  uhm

Never mind

I was just thinking about four we could go  drinking lager or or  cappuccino and some cakes

Thinking about your yoga you see

Well well cos I 'm I 'm I 'm sure I can manage a half Kate 

Uhm 

Are you having a reasonably uhm nice afternoon

You know uhm tran uhm transplant

Transplant call

Yes we are but uhm I don't think that 

I think it starts next week so the beds are sort of they 're trying to keep the beds fairly empty so we don't have to worry about  uhm finding beds if and when we need them

Uhm uhm

Uhm uhm

So   

When when are you going to start that C A P D thing

Well it 'll be one day apparently

I thought it was going to be for a week

They can't fit me in for a week so I 'm going to do it for a day which is useless really but  I just heard today

Oh well

I don't know

It 'll just be one odd day 

I was hoping it 'd be a week so I could get off the ward for a bit but

Oh

Already

Well you know it 's nice to have a change you know

I 'd be working with Paula as well so that would be it would have been OK  but  we 'll see

we 'll see

Perhaps I can wangle the next off-duty 

Didn't want to hassle them after having lots of bank holidays for the holiday you know

Yeah

Uhm uhm

Yeah

So 

Oh yeah

I mean whatever  

I saw uhm I saw Rebecca today and Anna

Uhm 

Seemed to be heading that way last time we saw her

Yeah

Uhm  Matt 's just left 

For Hertford

Well I presume so

He didn't really say where he was going but he sort of left on the bike  so that 's probably where he 's off to

isn't it

Oh right

Yeah probably or perhaps via somewhere else

Yeah

Well listen

are we going to be eating at your parents ' or here

Oh yes yes yes probably

We are

Well have something now if you 're hungry

Phoned Sean

Uhm  yeah so we might go out for a meal 

That was the idea

Oh tonight

Yeah

Oh we mustn't be too late then 

No suppose not

Mind you they might n they might just   going and getting pizza or something

I think I think they might do that actually

It 's either that or going to uhm possibly uhm 

There 's a Chinese or Japanese restaurant or Cantonese something like that

Actually sit down you know

a restaurant not a i in Hertford

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah yeah

Yeah I know the one

Yeah you do yeah

We could go to there you know 

It 's up to Laura really isn't it  in the end

Yeah

I 'm sure she 'll say oh I don't care oh

Yeah 

I picked up a load of uniforms

They 're not very nice

Oh yeah yeah

Do they fit and uhm

Well they 're all right but they 've got uhm  two pockets on the front not one

What

on the top 

High pockets you mean

Yeah

And and they 've ta

What they 've done is they 've given me a big size and taken them in so I don't know about them actually 

They 'll be long then

will they

Well no they 've taken them up as well  but I 've just sort of I 've just tried one on now and I think it 's still too big but 

Oh I can't be bothered to suss the bloody thing

Uhm

Oh

I thought uhm someone was going to put them through a washing machine

They were but I didn't pick them up till I we on the way home and I couldn't be bothered to bring them back and I thought oh well I 'll leave it

Uhm  what are they

They 're cotton aren't they  

Bring them up with you tonight

Yeah

Oh no I don't want to hassle your mum 

It 's all right

Well I don't see what hassle it is

She bungs them in the washing machine bungs them in the drier

They 'll be probably be done in that evening

Yeah

No I I 'll leave them

It 's all right

They 're all right to wear actually

I 've got one on now

It 's not as stiff as the other ones were 

So I think it 's slightly lighter material

It 's the same but

I don't know

They just don't 

Not not as bad you know

Not as stiff as the other ones but

I 'll get them hung up on coat hangers

I 'm Professor Sidney Greenbaum 's secretary at University College London 

Uhm we 've received uhm a newspaper copy of a newspaper cutting  called uh The Lawyer  saying ex-D J Freeman partner settles claim out of court 

Uh Professor Greenbaum was rather perplexed

Can you

Oh yes

Yes

Yes

That 's right

Yes

Was he ah

Oh yes I can

My firm was uh D J Freeman and Co was  very reluctant to say it put it mildly to give out details to people of my 

Uhm can you hold on a minute sorry

Yes 

Sorry

They were very reluctant to give out details of my address and telephone number and uh so I 've and people have been were complaining like mad that they couldn't find me so I went through all my old records  and cards  uh to write to people uhm uh just to say where I was and it 's the writing to them consisted of that uh new card you see

And Mr Greenbaum was I 'd say a lucky recipient or unlucky as as as uh as the case may be

Uh cos I met him some while ago

He may not remember 

But that was the reason for it

Uhm

I

Uhm

Oh I see

All right then

Uhm well thank you very much

He was a little

He he he said he didn't know of anybody of  by this name and he was uh

But as you 'd know you 've probably met him and he 's forgotten about it

Oh right

OK

Well

Oh I met him some time ago and he may not remember

But anyway do send him my best regards

won't you

Yes

I certainly will yes

Yes and uh thank you very much for your call

Yes thank you

Bye bye

All right thanks

Bye bye

Hello

Hello

It 's me

Yes

Uhm 

Yes

Do you think it 's a good idea that we walk home tonight

Well no it 's

I mean I 'm quite happy to get on the bus

I 'll give in 

  I

I haven't got my backpack with me to put your shopping in and uh

Oh yeah I just remembered how the look of you when you came up the stairs with all that stuff 

There was rather a lot



Yeah 

I don't fancy uh hauling it uh  down to Charing Cross

No no

Maybe another night

Yes 

So shall we take the bus

Yes

ideal

Righto

See you about half five

I 'll come along

Yes

OK bye

Bye

Hello

Hi Sean

Hello Justin

You all right

Yeah

Good good

Uhm any news

The news

I 've I haven't been able to get hold of Dave Anderson all day

I 've phoned him quite a few times

The French guy in the studio says that he 's been going on about having to go to London to to cut a record tomorrow so  it sounds OK 

Just that he hasn't been in all day

Mmm

Yeah

Right

Uhm besides that I 've been phoning round the press 

It seems the entire press world is going to Urban Dance Squad as I expected

Yeah

Oh God

What about that girl 

I haven't phoned her yet

Got her home number

It 's sort of a case of phoning her in the evening at home

Mmm 

Ah damn

She 's she 's working all day

I suppose that Phil Alexander guy

He 's going to Urban Dance Squad Phil Alexander is

Yeah I thought he would

Yeah I thought he would

The on the only people so far I 've managed to get you are the usual people Marilla and Chris

They 're coming down are they

Everybody else is going to to Urban Dance Squad

It 's a big event

Yeah

Oh well at least it looks better for us when there 's nobody there

Well well I mean I think we might

I don't know

I 've had a fairly good reaction from it people coming down  uh so

OK

I just thought I 'd phone up

I 'm phoning from work anyway

I 'll tell you why I 'll tell you why when I see you next

Right

Right

OK then

But uhm

So Chris and Marilla are definitely coming down

Yes

Marilla 's bringing some people with them and then you 've got the couple of people from Riff Raff but besides that

Uhm yeah

I bumped into somebody else at the Astoria last week who was saying oh I I 'm writing for Riff Raff

I 'll come down

She was a girl 

I don't know who she was 

I don't know

I didn't get her name 

She 's coming down

Right

Right well she can get in for a quid then can't she

Oh she said she could get in anyway so

Right

Said she 's new

Didn't remember our feature 

God knows who she is

She 's probably 

Right

Yeah you do meet quite a few people like that

What about uhm 

Did you

W when you were talking to Dave about the about the ar the cover yeah  uhm 

Right you said you were going to bring it tomorrow

Did you have any kind of plan for if it wasn't ready for tomorrow 

Yeah

Not really no

Oh right

I 'm just thinking about if we see the photos uh

We 'll probably like them but what happens if we hate them

I think to be quite honest you shouldn't give e Dave Anderson any excuse for delaying anything

I know

I know

I i if if you hate these photographs more than the one that 's on the back of the the album I think you should leave the one on the back of the album because if y y if you turn round and say well hold on we want to change something at this point  you 're just playing straight into his hands

I know

It 's awful

I suppose if we I suppose if we were to go with it without photos on

But I mean we need photos really 

You 've got to have a photo on there because everybody expects you to be

Pre-conceived ideas on Demi-Monde as a record label

People have got so many different ideas about you

Mmm

Yeah

Some some people think you 're a dodgy old Hawkwind band

other people think you 're a heavy metal band 

Photographs have got a bit of attitude in there

Mmm

Mmm

OK

I 'm sure they 'll be good anyway

I 'm just like

It 's difficult like leaving everything to the last minute but that 's the way it 's been 

OK

Uhm tomorrow right

Are you you you are you going to come down with us

Uh I shall come try and get down there uh for the cut

I 'll phone you back later on with the full final confirmation that Dave 's going to be there and everything

Right uhm

I 'll I 'll be in Hertford this evening

Right

Uhm either

Have you got the number there

I have yeah

Yeah

You can either try and

Cos it 's my sister 's birthday 

So uh you can either try and get me there or  uhm I 'll probably phone you

Right

Right

Well if you 're having a party or anything like that it 's probably best if you phone me so I don't disturb you

Yeah well

I don't know if it 's a party

It 's a kind of

We might be out for a meal so

I don't know what 's going on but

Yeah I 'll do that later

Right

OK

So I was just going to say if you are going to come with us

Well just bear in mind that we 're going to have to go on the bus

At least one of us is cos we don't want to take the tapes on the Underground 

Yeah

I mean I don't know

I mean they 've already been on the Underground a couple of times but

Ye uh d I I 've always heard

With videos you always hear people who who who know somebody who whose friend had it happen to them but I 've never actually met anybody who 

But  it 's not worth it

No

Chris Huxter was telling us

They 're probably completely knackered anyway but

No I just

There 's all these horror stories about it happening but I 've never actually heard of it   actually happened to anybody

It 's just

Mmm

No

Yeah

Well Matthew 's saying oh I 'll take them on the back of my bike and I 'm going oh uhm yeah OK uh 

I 'm not sure about that

Oh God 

Well we might

All I 'm saying is we 'll have might have to take a bit of extra time  to get there

Anyway

Yeah

Well I don't know what 's happening yet

No

I I shall I shall let you know later on

Right

OK then

OK

Well I 'll speak to you later

Right

Right

Is an is anybody doing any leafleting tonight

Do you know

Well  where where is there to do

The Ca the Camden Palace tonight

Yeah

Fabulous are playing there tonight so it seems there 's a lot of people going cos Fabulous are getting so much hype at the moment 

There 's there 's a lot of people going to that one tonight

Mmm

Right

Right

Well uhm see we 're going I 'm going up to this thing in Hertford

So is Matthew 

Now Mar either Mark could do it or

See Ruth 's not working tomorrow  and we 're driving so we could go and do it coming out 

But of course if it 's press and record people they 'll be coming out early 

Right

Right

Yeah

There 's there 's there 's just sort of

Because Fabulous are being hyped 

everybody I 've spoken to today says are you going there tonight 

God

I mean uh

They really uh they really annoy me that band 

Yeah they do

Mmm

Uhm well yeah I mean I could do it

I mean I suppose if I got there at one o'clock I could wait outside for an hour or so  and get people as they drift away from one o'clock on

I mean

Right

Mind you if if Mark 's around

perhaps he could do it

Mmm  yeah

But doing it on the way in 's probably not the best idea either

I don't know

why

Cos you know what the the bouncers are like there

Yeah

As you know 

Uhm yeah OK well I 'll I 'll try and sort something

I need to phone Mark anyway 

We 'll try and get it sorted 

We we 're nearly out of flyers anyway so

OK

Right

Right well I 've got a few here but Greedsville are supposed to turn up tonight so I 'll try and hassle them to get over there

Oh right OK

Oh what

are they staying at your place

Yeah

They 've got this thing about coming down to gigs the night before 

Fear of breaking down

Oh

Yeah well that probably makes a lot of sense

Yeah

They 're really dedicated aren't they

It 's quite nice

Yeah 

Sweet 

I 'm look I 'm quite looking forward to seeing them again

They 're quite  you know

Quite n

Very nice guys

Yeah they are definitely

OK then

OK

Well I 'll speak to you later

Right speak to you then

Cheers

All right

Bye

Bye

The  changeover from the first to the second stage is as you probably know widely thought to be the reform inaugurated by King Josiah in uh six hundred and twenty-one B C when he discovered the law book in the Temple and carried out a reform which very closely agrees with the measures proposed in Deuteronomy

Anyway the second stage is represented in Deuteronomy and is thought to reflect what happened in Israel 's religion between Josiah 's reform in six hundred and twenty-one and the Exile

uh or really I should say it later than the Exile until the fifth century until really the mission of Nehemiah the mission of Ezra and Nehemiah in the middle of the fifth century 

The reason for the change seems to be that the author of the book found in the Temple uh the author of the book found in the year six hundred and twenty-one in the Temple in Josiah 's reign was uh concerned that the many sanctuaries that at that point had existed all over the country and the free access  which everyone enjoyed to the priestly office had meant that all sorts of possibly undesirable forms of worship were occurring

So he wants to bring it under control and say the only place where you could worship was the Temple in Jerusalem and the only people who could offer sacrifice were the members of this one tribe the tribe of Levi

So there was a a definite narrowing which seems to have taken place at that point from the year six hundred and twenty-one 

The Levites had a role in the lur in the other temples didn't they

Ah yes

But a different role  uh because when we get to the time of uh Ezra as with the more classical Wellhausen uh hypothesis when we get to the time of Ezra we have the further narrowing of the office of priest 

No longer can any member of the tribe of Levi  act as priest 

There is one particular family those who trace their descents to Aaron

they are the priests

The other Levites are subordinate to them

The people have now divided into three sections priests on the top other Levites some are called simply Levites  that league beneath them and reduced to menial service to the priests and then beneath them the ordinary Israelites 

Uhm

I thought that was what Ezekiel said

Uh Ezekiel it 's true was moving towards that

that uh if Ezekiel had the idea Ezra and Nehemiah put it into practice 

So uh that was why I was hesitating and saying or down to the Exile

Down to the Exile so far as the theory goes

Down to  Ezra and Nehemiah so far as the actual practice goes

And what about the rebellion of Cora and all that

I thought that also was because the Levites were so upset that they weren't allowed to do what the Aaronites could do

Indeed 

Many think that the story of the rebellion of Cora dates to uh the time of Ezra and Nehemiah when Ezra and Nehemiah were  forcing through this new regime with the Levites being  put under the thumb of the priests

Yes

And Well some people think that this piece was written in order to show uh that these Levites were up to no good 

And the the story was written in order to reflect the discontent of the Levites at that time though it was projected back into Moses ' day 



So before the centralisation of the Temple  you had local temples where anybody could do whatever they liked in them more or less

 could be officiating

Mm mm

That 's right

uh Yes

And this is thought to be representative of parts of Genesis as well as those laws in Exodus which I mentioned uhm

laws in Exodus Twenty

and the following chapters uh

because you see  Abraham and Jacob going up and down the country consecrating places  like Bet-El

If you read the description as to how Jacob spent the night in Bet-El and he says how wondrous is this place this is the gate to Heaven this is the house of God you would really think from that that uhm Bet-El was going to be the site of a glorious temple

And there were people who believed that Bet-El is the site of a glorious temple

It w was that even north in Israel 

But from the viewpoint of the south and also from the viewpoint of much of the Pentateuch Bet-El is an awful place

It 's an illegitimate shrine 

So  Wellhausen found  many different stages

You see he found traces of all three stages in the Pentateuch

They were the stage where anyone could offer sacrifice the stage where it was restricted to a single site and to the tribe of Levi and then the narrowest stage of all where it 's restricted to a single site and to the family of Aaron

and the Levites  are their servants

So we  have these three stages

And when we try to bring the Book of Malachi into that framework it does seem that Malachi moves in the world of the second stage in the world of D or of Deuteronomy

Uh because he too equates Levites and priests

He knows of no distinction between the two 

Look at Chapter Three Verse Three how God will purify the children of Levi like silver and gold like gold and silver and they will be offering sacrifices to the Lord in righteousness 

Not the  children of Aaron the children of Levi 

Similarly the priests are called Levi or children of Levi in  in Chapter Two Verse Four uh

My covenant is with Levi

he says to them

but he addresses them as in Two Verse One the priests

You see

So if you put together Two One and Two Four you again have this equation

priests equals Levite which is the one you find in Deuteronomy running right through that book 

So and And all the religious institutions which Malachi mentions uh the tithe the  offering the ban on offering lame animals and so on are already found in Deuteronomy

There 's nothing in Malachi that compels us to suppose that uh Malachi was familiar with the P portions of the Pentateuch that is with those portions which presuppose that more complicated cult with priests distinguished from Levites And

And so on

Another point of contact with Deuteronomy is that he calls the Mountain of Revelation Horeb in Chapter Three Verse Twenty-Two as the Deuteronomy does and not Sinai

Of course that 's only That 's only a small point

So the  upshot of that is that if one tries to view Malachi against the background of the hypothesis of development of Israel 's religion as Wellhausen proposed then one comes down pretty squarely  in the period before priests and Levites were separated

And you 're right to say that the idea comes from Ezekiel

But you must remember this

until Ezra and Nehemiah there were no powerful personalities to organise the people and to put into practice such a far-reaching change

One needed someone like Ezra and/or Nehemiah people who came with the backing of the Persian government  in order to  make such a far-reaching transformation

But were not the priests  in the Temple in Jerusalem always Aaronites or even from 

I always got the impression that the Levites who came from working in all the local shrines they got put out of business  

leaving the the descendants of Zadok firmly in control in the Temple 

Do you not think that that was the case

Yes

Yes

No I I

That probably was the case

I think that  Deuteronomy was  not altogether practical in foreseeing the effects of uh implementing the Law

The fact

the factor who you had that Zadok 

Yeah 

Yes I think I 

Yes I I think this is this is why you 've got a third stage

I think in the first stage uh you 've got 

Yeah yes

Uh in large measure I think that 's probably so

In the first stage you 've got an absolute free for all

Then I should think uh before the time of Deuteronomy you 've got a specialist class emerging the Levites

but they don't have any legal rights

It 's just the people recognise them as being better at the job but they don't have a statutory uh monopoly on offering sacrifice

Uh this idea that Levites are better at their job is uh I think we can notice quite clearly from that story at the end of Judges

I think Judges Chapter Eighteen where a man has a private shrine where he dedicates his son as the priest but when a wandering Levite comes he 's much happier

He says now I 've got all blessings because I got a Levite to be my priest

So I think you got yes before Deuteronomy informal recognition of the Levite

Then Deuteronomy comes along

and he tightens up

and he says

right no one but a Levite can be a priest

and no way would in Jerusalem  sacrifice be offered

And uh his hope is that sufficient employment will be found  for all the people at the different shrines who are in fact already Levites in Jerusalem

So  when he restricts sacrifice to a single site he is making real change because until now sacrifices had been conducted everywhere

But when he restricts the office of priest to the Levites he 's not making real change because it 's very likely that uh Levites were already in office in these places

He is simply saying officially you 've got to be a Levite

And then as you say uh  Deuteronomy hoped that all the Levites would somehow find employment in the Temple in Jerusalem

And uh Deuteronomy also continually commends the Levite along with the widow and the orphan for charity  uh just in case they don't find employment

And in the end they don't uh because as you say the priests in Jerusalem in service in Jerusalem hang on to their jobs

And And uh so you get in effect the local Levites uh being degraded

And when the next stage occurs when this is actually set down in a book in a law this is no more than recognition of the situation that 's already arisen

So that yes you 're right to point out that as regards  both the restriction of worship to Levites in the time of D  and as regards the restriction of worship to priests in the time of Ezra in the time of P the law is lagging behind practice

It 's simply codifying what has  already happened for for different reasons

The Levite In uh these times the Levite 's already taken over

Because of a general tendency to specialise they 've acquired for some reason their speciality and professionalism

And in the time of P the reason that the  that the priests are given this monopoly is that  they 've got it

And uh Ezekiel can see it coming and as he says in theory this is the way it 's got to be

And it 's then actually made into an institution It 's

It 's promulgated

It 's decreed in the time after in the time after Malachi



Even before it went wrong

Yeah

Yeah 

One might suppose that  before the Exile

It wasn't that long between sixteen twenty-one and the Exile

But the Aaronites were in charge in Jerusalem and later when they came back again the Aaronites had lost control and had to be reinstated

That 's also possible yes that the Aaronites were uh weaker and that the Levites reasserted themselves

As you see There 's

There 's no

Is there any indication in Zechariah that the high priest was was an was an Aar was an Aaronite or

In Zechariah 

No

But Zechariah 's historical allusions are very obscure

He talks about Jerusalem a lot   and he names the High Priest 

Yes

But I don't think  

Is Joshua the High Priest

Yes

It doesn't say these words precisely

It doesn't say that he 's the son of Aaron

No

But doesn't say what he is

He might not be 

But that 's right

I mean at that stage it might not have been made official that you need to be from the from the family of Aaron 

So we 've got then all these pointers to a time shortly before Nehemiah 's reform 

And of course a late date is suggested by the fact that Malachi is the last of the prophets

He 's placed after Haggai and Zechariah who as you saw last week we can date pretty exactly in the late sixth century

So it 's not surprising to find this prophet in the early fifth century

So let 's take a nice simple sentence

Who would like to think of a simple English sentence 

Can anyone think of a simple English sentence

The cat sat on the mat

Uh thank you  

Cat  sat on the mat 

Right

Who 's going to volun Are you volunteering to draw us a tree as well

That was very kind of you wasn't it  

You 'll notice this is a new use of the term volunteer

Yes it is

It 's uhm 

While that 's going on can everybody remind me who they are because I 've forgotten everybody 's name

Vicky

Yes

Vicky

Phil

Phil

Phil

Uh and you at the blackboard

Susan 

Susan

Thank you

Vincent

Vincent

And you in the yellow

Uh Je Jeremy

Jeremy

Thanks

Jo

Jason

Jas Oh dear

Thomas

Thomas

And we know about him

You see I shall forget again but I 'll try 

It gets complicated around there doesn't it

Uh it is rather

I don't know what to do with that

It looks like a prepositional

Well do what you like because the more mistakes you make the more interesting it becomes

Oh all right

Uhm well I 'll do this bit 

Uhm

Cos if you get it all right then you know I 'm being paid for nothing

That 's right uhm 

While she 's While she 's doing that could you tell me what the  you were speaking a bit of uh nucleated form what the E in transcription what the C stands for 

The letter C

I don't 

Oh it 's like English ch in church

ch

Yeah

So the word for tree is 

All right

Thank you

Can you put a prepositional phrase in there  or not

Just try it and see what happens 

Oh I 'll make a mess of this now 

OK

That looks pretty 

So now we can have people object to it  if anybody wishes to object to it

Georgina

Right

From the P P shouldn't it  be 

oh hang on let me think

before  a V P

And then  followed by N P

V P then governs on N P

Uhm we should have a V P where N 

Sorry

Yeah

Why don't you come and draw it because it 's much easier than waving your hands which are not immediately transparent

No

I don't think I 'll be able to move actually

Well draw another V P because that 's the bit that presumably you 're worried about

So don't change that one

Change Put another V P somewhere so that we can see what you want 



Can you read it

Yeah 

Oops 

Jo can you manage

Or can you not see that

I can't

OK

Uhm can you draw a tree from the blackboard so Jo can see at the same time

If you draw it on yeah on a bit of paper  if you 've got a spare piece of paper 

On here

Yes uh uh

Yeah

I 've got this

Right 

If you want a large black pencil  that 's a marker pencil which you have there 

OK

So now we 've got two trees  one of which has got a prepositional phrase underneath the noun phrase

And the other 's got a noun phrase underneath a prepositional phrase 

And one of them is odd

The top tree is odd Susan 's tree 

Why is it odd

Because the prepositional phrase is  in the wrong place 

Well if there 's something that 

There 's no label  on one of the nodes 

And every node is supposed to have a label 

So what we 've got here  is some strange anonymous thing

Uhm  what do you think it is 

Just that the label 's a bit

Uhm

Noun

It 's a noun phrase 

You think it 's a noun

So you would be happy if we put in a noun phrase there

Yeah

No

Because it

No

You 've got one We You 'd have

You 'd have to rearrange that

Are you suggesting we can't have one noun phrase inside another noun phrase 



Well when you said you 've got one that seemed to be the implication

Well you 've got the other one there 

Or perhaps    

Uh I mean you don't need one there although in principle you could have one there  

So  let 's assume that was a noun phrase 

Then what we 're saying is that the only difference really between those two trees is that in one case on the mat is described as a noun phrase and on the other on the mat is described as a prepositional phrase

There are others 

Yeah

Yeah





Draw another one













OK

That 's the mistake I wanted

Thank you  

Uh  I knew it would come if I waited long enough

Uh  all right

Let 's clear up one or two things

and then we 'll come back because the idea of this was that we see what a constituent is 

and we 've now got a suitable basis for doing it

First we notice that on is just a preposition

There 's no need to have a prepositional phrase 

So we don't need both of those 

Secondly  for the current argument  we can go straight ahead to this one to Georgina 's tree with a prepositional phrase because it is indeed the case that on the mat  is a prepositional phrase of some kind or other

So let me put up two different trees now which will illustrate the point that I wanted to get over 

What we 've got is now two possibilities 

Then the other one

I will cross this one out as well 

And we 'll come back to a slight difference I am going to make 

Or maybe I won't make it that

I 'll do what Vicky did 

But sorry is this the right example

Is this correct now

Who knows

I really don't know  

We 're going to vote on it 

OK 

So if you can put both those down the whole point is  which one is right 

When I said we 've got the right mistake what I meant really was that we 've now got a pair of examples one of which is probably right and one of which is probably less right 

And  uh the the bit apart from the V P is supposed to be the same 

That doesn't matter 

Now in each case notice we 've got the cat sat on the mat 

OK we 've got the correct sequence of words

And in both cases  we have got the claim that on the mat  is a constituent 

OK

So if you think how do we know that on the mat is a constituent  we 'll look at each of them 

In each case you can trace the sequence of words on the mat  back to a single node which doesn't dominate anything else 

the circled P P on the left  and the circled N P on the right 

So is it clear to everyone that we 've got a constituent on the mat in each case  because if that 's not clear speak because otherwise it 'll be  a disaster

Oh right

But is on a constituent by itself as well

Every lexical item is a constituent

We can trace on back to the single node P in each case which doesn't dominate anything else

So lexical items are always going to be constituents 



It dominates determiner and noun

Yes



Yes 

That 's true

But for the moment all I wanted to establish was that the whole sequence on the mat  is a constituent in each tree 

The crucial difference between the two trees  is that the one on the left  also says that the mat  is a constituent 

The one on the right  says

the mat is not a constituent 

Is that also clear to everyone  because you can trace it back to the N P exhaustively 

In this one that 's supposed to be a P

I know that it doesn't look it

But never mind

Whereas if you take the mat on the right hand tree there 's no node that exhaustively dominates that determiner and noun

The N P does dominate it

But the N P there also dominates a preposition 

OK

So there are two crucial differences between those two trees

One and the more important one says that  the mat is or is not a constituent

And the other one says that the sequence on the mat is a constituent either of the type prepositional phrase  or of the type noun phrase 

And so we 'd now have to decide on both those which one 's the correct one 

OK 

Let 's dispose of the simpler one first as to whether it 's prepositional phrase or a noun phrase

What do people think

Who votes for prepositional phrase 

Who votes for noun phrase 

Well I fear the prepositional phrases have won by a large majority

But given that linguistics is not democratic  we can't necessarily accept that

Iliana why do you think it 's a noun phrase 





Why



Well we 've done it in that tree

And all you have to do is write a rule that says P P goes to P N P 

And it 's easy to do

But I agree there 's an interesting question as to whether it 's the right thing to do 

What do other people What do people who voted for prepositional phrase have to say in its favour 

Yes

Jo

Well it could be

I think they are equally possible

They 're both 

Right

And it 's hard to see how you can

So basically you 're abstaining on this vote

Yes

Or voting on both sides which is illegal

Well I 'd go for a prepositional because uhm  if you look at the word the the mat the mat the mats it goes with mat not on which you can see uh on the prepositional phrase cos it goes back to noun phrase 

But on the second one the could just be with either

And then 

OK

But

OK 

Uhm that sounds more like an argument for having a constituent N P  than an argument for saying that if you 've got the constituent N P  you should have prepositional phrase up here

Because there 's a third possibility  that we could 've had

N P  goes to P  N P  determiner noun

So that would satisfy your  criteria

But it wouldn't actually tell us uh because you 'd still have a constituent the mat

but it wouldn't distinguish between the prepositional phrase and the noun phrase 

Oh yeah 

Uh 

Oh yeah

Is it that that wouldn't actually allow for verbs which do need a preposition like i e the cat sat down 

Which wouldn't allow for the cat to sit down

If you had uhm a noun phrase and a preposition with the one that you 've just drawn just now

This one here

Or that one or the the

Or this one

I think

Yeah yeah

Uh it 's not going to allow us to do what

Verbs which require a prep

is it a preposition

Verbs like in the cat sat down

Yeah

Who no

No

It 's not really a preposition

Sorry

It 's some kind of directional adverbial

Oh right

But uhm uh it doesn't allow for it

But that is in fact not a principal objection because clearly we 've only written very few rules so far and we could write lots more that would account for that

OK uh well maybe uh Colin will talk about language 

Just take a specific issue here for a cognitive type 

Uhm

Yeah it 's about uhm how genetically b bad based the development of language actually is 

So that just before

does anyone have any  uh a priori  views on this 

Here 's a problem

Human language  is it genetic 



Bird song for instance  seems to be genetic

Uhm sparrows all sing the same way 

What about human language

Well I mean surely we 're all born with a certain ability to be able to speak and so comprehend the sort of concept of language

but how it then develops is due to our own our environment

what happens to us 

Uhm

Anyone else 

Uhm

That sounds reasonable

Does anyone just

I mean in the in the population at large as it were before anyone studies psychology are there views on this matter

or I mean I don't know anyone 

No overwhelming feelings that it must be learnt 

I mean it is learnt right

Languages are learnt

It 's obvious isn't it 

Isn't it

You know

I don't speak the same language as a French person

I 'm not born knowing English 

Uhm languages are obviously learnt

so what 's the genetic thing if anything

What would you 

what might it be 

Well  if in humans there is a genetically encoded part of language uh you 'll have to find out ba to what extent uh language is genetically encoded

Whether we have say a passed down separate vocabulary which every human being which we 'd all actually know this vocabulary

or is it all completely learnt

Uhm right

There 's also other parts

Say uhm our language tends to be known as rich and specific

i e we have a l we have a very large vocabulary

Most people 's vocabulary is over fifteen thousand words and with this we can be absolutely specific

Using one sentence uh we can actually say an idea which everybody will know what we mean

It is very specific in our choice whereas say uh in another language one which couldn't form uh a good sentence you could say it but there 'd be uh ambiguity

People wouldn't know what we 're talking about to a very specific  degree 

There seems to be much evidence though that language acq acquisition itself is genetically based as all children seem to go through the same stage of language acquisition

From about the age of one children speak uh a child will speak one or two words not actually in a sentence or anything like that just come out with random words 

You know usually not the ones parents hope to hear

From about the age of two the child will speak two or three uh word sentences you know

They 've got a slight meaning behind them but you can't really say

It might sort of say Daddy bed meaning Daddy on bed or something like that

Uh you can actually see the idea behind it but you know they 're not using language very well

Then as they get older they get into grammatical sentences

and uh about the age of four most children can actually speak to virtually the same standard uh that a adult can speak

Thank you

any comments

That was what it said in the textbook

I 'm actually not too sure 

That 's right

No 

What about four-year-olds can speak to the same standard as adults

Uh uh

Well what you tend to find is if you speak to a five-year-old they can speak but like the content is very peculiar

They tend to make a lot more leaps and bounds 

adults do and they don't really have the continuity they sort of

It 's mainly the content which differs rather than the actual language itself

and obviously their also their vocabulary is nowhere near as large as an adult adult 's 

but uhm it seems to be that in the first two or three years of life they just intuitively grasp some of the uhm grammatical rules and knowledge uh of their native tongue

Do you mean that they 've got their grammar sorted by five years

Is that what you mean

Most of them have 

Apparently

Apart from that they 're much better but uhm

I think what it means is uhm they can they know what language is

they know what they 're trying to do

It 's just the fact that they haven't learnt all the words they need to do it

It 's not just not only the words is it they haven't got the concepts either

Uh Is it is it Piaget who who who said about the different stage of development

You don't understand abstract concepts until you 're much older 

so they can't express those properly

Uh uhm

Yes

Yes

Uhm

I should think that 's prob that 's true uh  uhm

So what are you saying is that the  that learning grammar is hard presumably

Not really

I It seems to be from uhm all the evidence that a child by the age of four has learnt most of his grammatical rules

It must be a specific part of the brain uhm completely devoted to learning language

If it is  say when we get older and uh we try and learn a language at school or something like that it takes us years to learn a language

and we 're never going to be able to speak it in the space of that a child can his native tongue two or three years

In two or three years of learning that language we 're never going to be able to speak it to the same standard we can speak our native tongue

and so it seems to be there must be some part of the brain which is specific uh to actually acquiring the native tongue

and there seems to be evidence as well

but I can't actually quote  my sources on this one

but there seems to be evidence as well that there is uhm space there for a second language

I suppose you could call it a space but and the ability to learn a second language 

Uhm there seems to be also what 's known as the critical period for acquiring this language

Uhm as easy it is when you 're very young between the ages of one to four

and there 's an example used here

There 's this girl called Jeanie

and rather nastily she had been tied to a chair until she was fourteen by her blind mother and never actually given any form of uhm sound or language communication

Any time she made a sound when she was being feeding fed she was punished

and this girl was then taught language by various psychologists and uh well-meaning speech therapists

but she never did actually become a proper native speaker

Uh it was almost as if uhm she had tried to learn a second language and she was always very halting in her use of language 

I mean we can never tell uhm

well not we

but they could never tell about how she would grasp concepts

Any comments on the use of a case like that as evidence 

You don't know about her mental  

Uhm

Yes so I mean like how would you know how she thought before then as well 

I mean Also I mean people use language in social interaction

You don't just learn words and grammar

you learn how to uh behave more generally

You know what words are appropriate in what contexts

what sort of things should you say to people

and a child who 's had no interaction with other people  might simply have failed to learn I mean what communication is or interaction is and so might lose as it were the motivation for learning all these things 

So uhm there 's always problems with uh cases drawn from  deprived childhoods in the case in the sense that they 're deprived of just about everything 

We can't tell offhand what 's interacting with what

In In technical terms we say

we have no controls for all the different factors that are all confounded in that one 

But there is one thing that you can seemingly draw uh from this case is that

there seems to be no innate vocabulary

If there was an innate genetically encoded vocabulary she surely must have been able to say a few things

If there was a basis that all human languages uhm are based upon and it 's genetically encoded it would seem that somebody like that should have uh just through the genetics an idea of vocabulary and some sort of vocabulary

but uhm in this case she seemed to have none

But that just totally discounts interactionism then

The interaction of genes with environment

That discounts it if you say that 

Uhm

Are you saying that you need interactions to sort of  yeah to bring out this innate vocabulary 

To bring out the genetics

Well if there was an innate vocabulary wouldn't you expect to go through all languages and find that they had the same words for things 

All bastardizations anyway

Pardon

All bastardizations of the same word

All

Bastardizations

I don't know 

I think he 's just made it up

Uhm

No right uhm

They sort of like they sound similar 

But wouldn't you I mean you could just look at languages as one source of evidence

I 'm not asking you these questions about how do we know things and

In view of what you were saying about interaction could be true because another case I have is a group of deaf children and they 're not actually taught sign language but within this group of deaf children uhm they develop their own sign language called home language

And so I mean I just said you know Jean uhm this case of Jeanie so that there is obviously no innate language but then if there 's these deaf children they develop their own language maybe there is some idea  of it but maybe there 's just more that the idea you should be learning a language and if there is no vocabulary you start making it up

Uh in this case they started using elaborate pantomime at first and then it became more coded uhm  sign language and then how to do sentences

Uhm not really too many concepts but they could do simple sentences with it 

It 's a sign language though

Uhm

It 's another form of communication

Uh so if if we 're to include sign language as evidence for genetic basis for language what 's the genetic basis

It 's not going to be just speech any more is it or

No it could be just re-routing because instead of hearing sounds they 're not able to hear sounds so what 's the point of speaking

You know they obviously use their eyes so they 're going to use their fingers for a start

But if the if the genetic uh con contribution was specifically for spoken language then it would just sort of have nothing to do

It wouldn't predict that they would sort of start using signs 

So if that if this evidence more suggests that there 's an innate drive to communicate by making some sort of s sign which symbolizes the internal uh message and that well I don't know perhaps speech has some priority in the absence of it  people start using any other sign that they can make 

Right we don't have much more time

We could uh clear up the cognitive thing

Uhm  the problem I really wanted to someone to talk about the use of twin studies but I don't think we 're going to  going to get them 

Actually Melanie does don't you in your  thing

Yeah I 'd like someone to say something about twin studies so somebody that 's well Melanie you might briefly run through because there are Esther 's es Esther 's essay doesn't uh use twin studies three-or-four-words

It 's very important in terms of how it 's tested

The standard The standard methodology in behavioural genetics is the use of twin studies OK

So we need to sort of talk about that briefly 

Uh Melanie 's essay is concerned with schizophrenia

Uhm

Yeah

Possibly

Yeah I was looking into genetic and environmental aspects and the major arguments for the genetic  hereditdit hereditit whatever the inheritableness of schizophrenia  uhm comes from twin and adoption studies

They found uhm two people in nineteen sixty-six that in identical twins which are genetically identical uhm there was a greater  concordance of schizophrenia than in the normal population a greater incidence  and

Do you know what concordance means anyone 

Uhm it means that 

If you don't know what someone means when you 're giving these talks you should say I don't know what that means would you please explain 

Perfectly legitimate

It means that very commonly both were schizophrenics so that points to uhm there being a hereditary factor in in it and they even found that when the twins had been brought up separately so they haven't had the opportunity to learn from each other to learn the illness 

Uhm in adoption studies  and

Do you actually quote any of the actual figures

Yeah uh I think so

Read it then 

If you haven't got them I I think for  identical twins uh  I think I 'm right I think there 's about fifty per cent so that if you that means that if you have two identical twins right and one of them is schizophrenic there is a fifty per cent chance that the other  will be schizophrenic

Now the control in these things are normally fraternal twins

These are children born at the same time brought up in the same family and so treated you know much the same or at least you would assume so but who aren't genetically identical

OK 

You see the rationale  for for this study

OK

We 'll interrupt it at that point to just do a quick statistical analysis of all your  your data shall we

So  let 's get a few uh ideas of what you made uhm reading number one

Anybody shout out that 's that 's got it

What did you make it

A hundred and eighty-six

Yeah

A hundred and eighty-six

And what about the diastole

A hundred and twenty-six

A hundred and twenty-six

Anybody make it lower than that

One seven eight

One seven eight

Anybody lower than one seven eight

One six eight

One six eight

One seventeen six 

What 's the lowest

One six eight 

So what about And what about anybody making it higher than that

One eight eight

One eight eight

Yeah

Anybody make it one ninety

One ninety anybody 

One ninety

So one eight eight 

So  there 's a difference there of twenty millimetres of mercury  

Well we 'll go back to that later

What about the diastole

Anybody make it lower than a hundred and twenty-six 

Must 've been somebody

Yeah

One two four

One two four

Don't be shy

You may be right

One two four

OK

What about higher than one twenty-six

One twenty-eight

One two eight

One two eight

Anybody

One three eight

One three eight

Wow  



 

All right 

Uh let 's take one or two

We do have to go forward

Uhm what about number three 

What d' you make that one in the middle

Two O eight

Two O eight

Yeah

Two O eight one three two 

Two O eight one three two 

Anybody make it higher than two O eight

Two ten

Two ten

Yeah

Anything higher than two ten 

You got another one

It 's definitely six

Two six

Two O six 

Lower than that 

No

Right

Two O six

Uhm what about

Anybody higher than one three two 

One three eight

All right 

Uh  what about lower than that 

One thirty 

Everybody made it one three two or above did they 

OK 

As you 're you 're getting used to it you 're getting better aren't you

You 're getting closer to each other



 

What about one one five

What did you make of that one

It went down

One sixty over ninety-six

One sixty ninety six

OK

What did

Anybody make it above one sixty 

No

Anybody make it lower than one sixty

One five eight



One five eight

Yeah

Any lower than that

One five six 

Oh lord that 's very close isn't it 

One five eight

OK

Uhm ninety-six

Anybody get anything higher than that

Ninety-eight

It 's ninety-eight to a hundred 

And uhm 

Oh I don't know

Anybody lower than ninety-six  

A hundred and ten   

A hundred and ten 

Is there 

Can anybody make it lower than that ninety-six  

Ninety-four

Ninety-four 

Ninety-two

 

OK

Well

 To do a  complex analysis of that uh later 

Uhm so what are the factors that var what kind of variation are we looking at now then

What is this 

What kind of variation is this 

Ninety-two

Random observer variation

This is  observer variation

What kind of 

Uhm between observer

Between observer

Mhm

That 's right

Between observer variation

As you

This is not like a real situation of course

You 're all You 're all seeing the same  uhm images on the screen and you 're all hearing the same sounds

At least hopefully you 're all hearing the same sounds and uh uh

So you haven't got any uhm subject variations involved here 

This is all pure observer variation

Of what kind 

It 's like every time they decide to open the valve to let the column down  there is a bleep 

and about five times afterwards you think it 's probably  

and it 's probably heartbeat  

Yeah

A funny noise

Yeah

Yes

Yes

Well you aren't supposed to  record the systolic when you you can hear more than one sound occurring you know successively aren't you

You could have told us

No that 's what you 're supposed to 

 within yourself whether you still agree with your answers

Yes

Well we may be able to tell you that in a minute

Give us the answers

You 've been given the answers already





















































































































All right

OK

So you should therefore be able to work out your own uhm within person variability to a certain extent in terms of those pairs which are actually the same  the same uh person being recorded

How did you get on with that  within person variability 

Terrible

Very well

Fairly well

Not very well

Well

Yes  

OK

So this therefore illustrates both  within person variability and between person variability

Uh now he mentioned right at the end there digit preference 

And uhm  the what this means is that if you take a lot of observers uh  and you ask them to measure  a series of blood pressures not necessarily all on the same person but on different patients

and you write them all down and you work out probably using a computer the frequency with which the last digits appear  say at a hundred that 's the last digit a hundred and two say at a hundred and four

a hundred and six and so on you 'll find when you 've got the histogram that the number zero is always usually more common than the other numbers

You get the frequency like that

Times two would be different

And why do you think that is

The line 's bigger

The line 's bigger

That 's a very good reason

 the  board one twenty one thirty

Yeah

It 's the way the maybe the way the calibrations are are made

Uh so somebody who 's

When the When the column 's coming down it 's that 's a hundred

and uh that 's a hundred and two

that 's ninety-eight

when there 's a bit of doubt as to which of these three it should be it 's more likely the person would choose a hundred 

People prefer numbers ending with zeros

And And for the reason you said it may be bigger on the scale and they home in on that one

So when you plot out a large number of readings you often can show digit preference 

Now there is a way round that which is used for epidemiological surveys 

Uh you don't use it in clinical practice

but you use special sphygmomanometers which have a what 's called random zero uhm device 

The It means that the the zero level  is variable so that you get readings

But I mean it 's it 's preset beforehand by the by the observer but he doesn't know what it is 

So it 's a random sort of offset anything between about nought and sometimes uh sixteen millimetres of mercury

So when he takes the readings he doesn't know where they should be because they 've all they 're all much higher than than he thinks should be

They 're they 've add You 've added on a a random extra number which you then substract at the end because he only finds out what it is at the end of the reading

That 's oft a method that 's often used in the big surveys of blood pressure reading

So But in clinical practice how can we reduce this variability

Frequency of blood pressure readings

Mm 

What automatic reading

Yeah

Yeah

Have any Have any of you seen those

Have any of you seen them  

Yep

That 's a good idea



Too expensive

More than anything too expensive    

And well another Well we 've already mentioned this already

Of course you  you get better repeatability the more readings you take

So I think from today 's session you 've realised I hope that you shouldn't start somebody on lifelong anti-hypertensive therapy based upon one single blood pressure measurement 

True

I would certainly not advise to do that nowadays

The recommendations for treating mild mild to moderate hypertension always say that they the blood pressure  at such a level after repeat measurements over a considerable period of time sometimes as long as six months  because you 're starting someone on lifelong therapy which may have side effects

So you should never do that on the basis of one single measurement for the reasons we 've been discussing today 

OK

What are the some of the factors which affect the blood pressure level in a in a patient

We 've al We 've already mentioned some of them 

Let 's go through them fairly systematically 

Well that 's uh that is the effect upon the observer

I 'm talking about the the subject variation

The operator is taking the blood pressure  

Oh you mean their their effect on them

Yeah

Right

Stress  I mean sex-related  related

Right

Good

So the the so-called white coat hypertension is one example of that

So sorry about that

Uh  what 

Whether the patients 're getting all uptight cos they have to wait outside the door  for a long time

Good

Other physiological factors which affect blood pressure



The temperature

The temperature of the room

The ambient temperature

What what Is it higher in the cold or lower

It 's higher in the cold

Yeah

That 's right

And lower in h hot ambient temperatures 

Posture

Posture

Whether lying standing or sitting 

What about other things they might 've got up to before they came into the  the room

Alcohol

They might 've run up the stairs

They might 've run up the stairs

They  might 've smoked a cigarette

Eaten a main meal

 sorry

They what

Does the effect of eating have any 

Eating

Possibly 

Yes

Like a cup of coffee

Cup of coffee

Wine

And so  so all of these things can have an effect on blood pressure

And of course there are then the the actual physical uh characteristics of the sphygmomanometer which may have an effect

Can you think about that

The size of the cup you use

Size of the cup

That 's the important one

The 

Right

When should you use a larger or smaller cup

Use a bigger cup in an obese person

Yeah 

And a smaller one

On a child

Children

Yeah

There should be these In all uh  situations where you 're measuring blood pressure there should be uh several cups a standard cup width and then a bigger one for obese subjects

And it actually has it marked on the cup 



Is that all right

OK

And of course ah uh external factors like you know the traffic noise and so on may also have effect on your ability to hear the sounds  and so on

So there are many factors which affect uhm measurement of blood pressure and in epidemiological studies of course we have to try to standardize all these things and try to equalise them out

But it 's random variation as we said before that will will tend to even out

We 've got to try and avoid systematic  biases between observers for instance

So therefore in these big surveys they train all the observers to measure blood pressure

They test them against each other or against films like this

And it that has to be done repeatedly throughout the survey if it 's going on a long time so that they can pick out people who are systematically  reading either high or low blood pressures

Uh so that 's another uh way of combatting that problem 

OK

Well d' you think you know something about repeatability now

I think you surely do

If you were an economic historian uhm which none of us thankfully are  you would say what you have to explain here is the rise to dominance in the American economy of large business corporations or as they 're popularly but inaccurately called trusts 

And most economic historians would say

the reason that these large business corporations got big was by efficiency that once you increase in size you can use your size as a weapon you can squeeze out your smaller competitors and the larger you get you can therefore make economies of scale

Therefore not only you can do what you are doing more cheaply

you can also pass on those savings to the consumer in the form of lower prices of whatever the product you actually sell actually is

That 's one view 

The Tarbull view which is that of most muckrakers of the progressive era is basically that big business got big by cheating 

Normally historians would say ninety per cent efficiency maybe ten per cent cheating

Tarbull says

ninety per cent cheating ten per cent efficiency

and there is one chapter in her book of nineteen chapters The jit Legitimate Greatness of the Standard Oil Company where she 's looking at all the things that are good that are organisationally finely tuned about Standard Oil

All right 

Which approach would we buy 

The view that it 's efficiency size economies of scale or the view that it is basically corruption that leads to bigness in the first place 

Which side of the argument will we come down on

I think it 's difficult to take Tarbull at face value because she 's got a lot of personal bias because of her father 

Yes

Her father was in the oil business in Pennsylvania at a time when it was expanding very rapidly

And all this stuff that uhm you were saying about the business of the uhm the young men life running joyously and ruddy etc and so on uhm is really a commentary on her fa on her father 's own generation

So when Tarbull thinks of business men driven out of business by Standard Oil she sees first of all her father

Her father is a man of incredible moral principle who will never do any work on a Sunday because it 's forbidden as he sees it in the Bible etc uhm

Exactly the sort of person that Rockefeller who also by the way of course is very religious but who he is going to trample underfoot and push out of the way

But I mean uh again a lot of people read that book as a panegyric to competition 

Although I 'm not sure it is because if you look at Tarbull 's record in real life what she 's saying is the only way you can beat a powerfully organised business combination is by an equally powerful organisation of other business ties

In other words what Standard Oil does is organise the refiners

The only way of beating them is to actually organise the consumers

This is exactly what Rebecca at some point of her presentation was actually saying

Fine

So I can see th everything that Richard is saying here that Tarbull is biased

That doesn't necessarily mean that what she says is wrong

Which side of the argument do we come down on 

Wouldn't it be somewhere in the middle because uhm

You sound like Spitting Image last night

I mean the climate was ripe for corruption

The The fact that uhm America does rise so fast uhm and had so uhm had not even  uhm thought about legality in that kind of area yet or or was just thinking of it

It was new

Wasn't that a climate that was ripe for corruption

Well what do you mean by corruption

Well for exploiting uhm you know uhm doing back-hander deals with the well-known companies

and es

Nothing was defined by law yet

so couldn't all these uhm little back-handers be going on all the time

Tarbull would disagree with that wouldn't she

She would say again as you were hinting in your presentation that the railroads are chartered by the State or if they 're transportmental by the federal government

They are basically common carriers

As common carriers they mustn't discriminate against various classes of their clientele

Yet along comes Standard Oil saying

OK we can guarantee say a thousand barrels of oil per day over this particular route

therefore we want either a rebate or a drawback or a kickback

What 's the difference between a rebate and a kickback stroke drawback 

A rebate is what

Is it when they send the money back 

Yes

But I mean in what sense

How I mean how how how do you define it in economic terms 

After a length of time

Well when you get a tax rebate you get the money back after about a year don't you

Reduction

Yeah uh

Standard Oil got its money back a damn sight quicker than most tax rebates come through

Uhm but I mean why did he get the money back 

Mm mm mm

Well cos it 's guaranteeing a certain amount of business for the railway

OK

Now isn't that normal commercial practice

You know if you put in a big order wouldn't you expect to get some kind of discount  except for the fact as Tarbull would say the railroads are common carriers

I mean they are obliged by their charters not to discriminate in this way

Uh uh th th that 's a very central point there 

Uh what 's a kickback or a drawback 

Mm

Mm

Well that 's got more sort of corrupt overtones hasn't it

Oh yes

Yes yes 

Seems more i more more in terms of a lump sum gift 

But a gift from who



It should be from who from whom from whom I think

From whom

From management

Management of what



Nah

No

Well it 'd be from the railroads

They 're being paid to 

Actually no in fact

The railroads are being used because uh what a what a kickback or drawback is basically

I mean give an example OK

Supposing uh Standard Oil is shipping a barrel of oil on the route from I don't know Cleveland to New York  it gets a rebate of say fifteen cents per barrel all right

A kickback or drawback means for every fifteen cents a competitor of Standard Oil  pushes along that same route Standard Oil gets paid fifteen per cent

In effect Standard Oil is taxing through the mechanism of the railroads its competitors who for obvious reasons are almost never going to stay in business confronted with that kind of unfair competition

But it 's secret

that 's the basic point

They don't They don't know it 's going on

Of course I mean you you you you can't defend that in sort of any kind of public terms whatever right 

So I mean again supposing we had been Rockefeller 's colleagues in the eighteen seventies 

Supposing we want to create a large commercial monopoly for whatever reason we 'll come back to why in a few moments how would we do it

Railroad rebates is one answer

What else

What else would we do 

It 's secret

We We would uhm incorporate producers on the financing 

Uhm we would try and get an angle on every business 

Yes we we we would take over people

All right

Now remember we 're doing this in the interests of efficiency

so we might for example uhm

There 's a technique called cutting to kill in which

I mean just to give you a sort of swift example supposing uhm you 've got a chain of gas stations a chain of petrol stations uhm and they have one independent competitor who sets up in business selling low petrol OK

What the chain does is sell even cheaper petrol to undercut this independent till he 's driven out of business or until he can be bought out by the main corporation

Hence cutting to kill

Now of course how do you buy them up

Sometimes you offer cash

Other times you say hey look

I mean there 's no point in competing

why don't you come in with us

You can become part of the South Improvement Company or later on you can become part of Standard Oil

We 'll give you stock in Standard Oil

You can even become a trustee of the company a member of the trust

All right

And then because of what you 've done uhm you know you 'll become wealthy

And look at the efficient marvellous commercial enterprise we 've produced

Now to Tarbull that 's wrong because you 're driving independents out of business 

To Rockefeller it 's rational economic planning

So as long as you 've got unrestricted competition you 've got you tell me

None of us are economists but

Unrestricted economic competition leads to 

What 's the main problem of oil producers and oil refiners in the first few your years of the oil industry in Pennsylvania 

Incredibly fluctuating prices

I mean you very often have gluts that depress the price almost to the point where it 's not worth producing

What you 're trying to do

and this is this is against all the arguments of business efficiency

I mean OK business efficiency says size equals increased efficiency equals lower prices

What you 're trying to do in fact is get away from a low price situation in which really you can't afford to be in business

You do this by eliminating your competitors and moving if you can to a kind of monopoly type situation

Mean why do people want to become monopolies

I mean this is one of the big sort of uh criticisms of the Jacksonian period in the eighteen thirties and again in the progressive era in the eighteen nineties nineteen hundreds

Or they mean something different

The monopoly of the Jacksonian period is well you tell me created how 

When Jackson talks about the Bank of the United States as a great monopoly in eighteen thirty-two  how is it a monopoly 

Yes

It 's nationwide

It 's

Nationwide

Uh yes

Uh a good if somewhat unexpected point

Yes

What else



Yeah it 's chartered by the Government

I mean it 's chartered by by Congress all right

I mean the idea of a monopoly in Jacksonian times is something which is actually literally created and condoned by the Government

Now Jacksonianism is about breaking that up

I mean if there is such a thing as a Jacksonian democracy that 's what they 're trying to do

Now later on the monopolies are in a sense self-created by the uh monopolies like Rockefeller and Carnegie uh and so on and so forth

But why do they want to create a monopoly 



Which



Well those are simple but not unappealing answers

Uh yes you get power and wealth out of it

but is that is that the only reason 

You 've got complete business security

Ah now isn't that the key

I mean you look at business conditions in America in the eighteen seventies and the eighteen nineties

You look at the number of bankruptcies that happened every year 

You look at the number of businessmen who go bust

I mean  some figures seem to show that one in every six businessmen have gone bankrupt at some stage or another  even worse than in Mrs Thatcher John Major 's Britain

Uhm it 's a period of profound insecurity in economic terms

Uhm security comes if you absolutely control all your industry

And that 's I think one of the basic kind of psychological motivations for most of the big trusts of this period

So I don't know if uh many of you came across this but there 's a very nice story in in Tarbull 's autobiography 

Uh for the one and only time she actually went to see John D Rockefeller in person not not to talk to just to look at

And what happened was was she sneaked into the back of his church 

He was always very diligent sort of immensely Christian gentleman as ever chiselled anybody out of five cents who taught his Sunday school class in Cleveland every week 

And she went to his church and sat up upstairs whate what whate whatever they call it in church terms

I 'm not doing very well for this use of English here

But I mean in one of the sort of pulpits whatever upstairs

and she she waited for Rockefeller to appear

She was expecting to see a commanding sort of mogul type figure

and Rockefeller kind of wandered in looking very thin ascetic and nervous 

and he sat with his back to the wall

And Tarbull said

he looked as if he was a man who was always on the lookout for enemies as if somebody was always trying to do him down

Of course again if you were John D Rockefeller somebody probably always was but that 's by the way

And I mean again the impression she got she was expecting massive self-assurance

What she got was massive insecurity

That was her impression

So actually what when we correlate what are we when we actually establish boundaries  what are we correlating 

For example if you ever go to a to somewhere and choose a boundary for  a geological system  you either choose a boundary between the draft and application where would you go where would be a good place to go Jackie 

What to find the actual boundary

Yes 

You mean Wiltshire or something like that

Well uhm but where would you go in principle to try and get something you could correlate 

You need a complete sequence

You need a complete sequence

 yes

What sort of sequence

Uh conformable 

Conformable

Yeah

And

With fossils in it

Deposited where 

Uhm underwater

How far underwater

Shallow

Shallow

Shallow

Why shallow

To  fauna

three-or-four-words 

You can tell from the fauna

Yeah

Yeah

You can tell what

Well best preservation 

The fossils are there two-words-mumbled

Right

OK

Preservation

But isn't the shallow water situation one that 's likely to be more uhm changeable

Small changes in slea sea level might turn it into a sequence that has no deposition 

Wouldn't it mean shallow  stable

Well what do you correlate

What is the best fossil to correlate with  in your 

You know I 'm not just talking about one group but what sort of fossils are good for correlation 

Give me some examples

Well 

With a wide geographical range and well  easily preservable

Right

 

Yeah OK

For example 

Ammonites

Ammonites

Ammonites or

Bivalves 

Bivalves

Are they  as useful as ammonites

No

Right

They 're not quite as useful are they 

What else 

Palaeozoic

What do we correlate in the Palaeozoic

Uh with in the Palaeozoic we don't use ammonites cos there aren't any

Graptolites

Graptolites 

Trilobites

Trilobites 

OK

what have those  types of organisms got in common 

Hard shell 

Mmhm

Yeah

Uhm

Easily preservable

Well tho they 're  you see they 're very easy to preserve

But what about their distribution

Easily identifiable

Wide horizontal distribution

Yeah

Graptolites for example where do Graptolites 

where do we find Graptolites

Black Forest shales

Yes

But deposited in what environment 

Deep seas

Very deep water

Very deep water

or they appear to be deposited in uh well they they were deposited in environments that were preserved in relatively deep environs as are often ammonites aren't they

Ammonites are present ov in a lot of marine strata deposited at different conditions 

So  we 're looking for sequences i in which we 've got a marine  a fairly complete marine record aren't we 

And we would choose a marine sequence rather than a non-marine sequence  other things being equal 

Right

So uhm  what happens then when we get to boundaries between different uh systems  for example at the end of the Silurian

What do we get in this country in the Silurian

What sort of rocks do we find in the Silurian 

Mm

Mm

Yeah

Yeah

Shales and 

Uh yes

What sort of shales though 

Uhm 

Black

Black shales

I can't remember

Uhm South Wales

What about South Wales Silurian 

Jackie 

It 's a sort of very muddy

and  you know

Uh  

David 



If you go up towards Aberystwyth you get this thing called Aberystwyth  grits which are what 

Grits

Yeah

Sandy

They are sandy but what

y You haven't seen them but you can actually just think about them

They 're turbidites

Mm mm

Oh right 

But as you come southwards towards South Wales you get into a shale sequence  don't you

Mm

Mm mm

You get all these things like Wenlock limestone and all these uh uh shallow water local  which have become so important in correlation 

Uhm the Devonian though

What is the Devonian in Britain 

Mm

Old red sandstones

Old red sandstones

What do you think of as typical Devonian

Which is what 



Uhm continental 

Continental  yeah

So

And there 's marine deposits as well

So between the Silurian and the Devonian is  what 

Bone beds

Big 

There are the bone beds but what happened  at the end of the Silurian 

Large mountain belts

 

Exactly

There 's a mountain building up a major orogenic eve event 

Now if we were actually looking at the stratigraphic column then we would actually s recognise there was a difference between the rocks that come before and the rocks that come afterwards in terms of their  age and appearance and character and so on and we would say that perhaps is a fairly important break

Now how important is that break the Devonian-Silurian boundary  on an

Like the Caledonian 

It is the Caledonian originally 

And how important is it on a worldwide scale

Mm

Well very important

Very important 

You couldn't

Across the North Atlantic anyway

Certainly across the North Atlantic

So it 's a fairly important event isn't it

Mmhm 

Uhm  and uh  should it be should it be expected to be applicable to  China  or Australia 

No

Not necessarily 

So what would we expect to see in those areas 

A complete sequence break

OK

So in other words  is th k is the stratigraphy that we have established in Britain because the Devonian comes from  where

Devon

Devon

Would do wouldn't it really

And the Silurian comes from uh Wales

Uhm why should the stratigraphic divisions that we 've established in Britain be of use in Australia  or  China

From Wales

There are certain elements of them are going to be aren't there

Why

Because we have got this worldwide correlation in some parts

Mm

The bone beds are worldwide aren't they 

You know there 's a broad division between one and the other 

I don't know

I 'm not absolutely sure about that 

Well I think so

But why should uhm

What you 're saying is that we 've established a purely local stratigraphy which such as you 've established in your own areas in your mapping projects for example

but yet it appears that by accident it has some global significance 

I think that 's just the fashion or fact that stratigraphy originated here

Is it

Mm mm

So in fact   the world

In o In other words you 're going to you would argue that perhaps  uhm  the stratigraphic column may not have been correctly divided up 

Yeah

Mm 

So are there any correct parts of it that we could agree on



The end of 

Why 's that 

Because it 's marked by a mass extinction

Mm

OK

Which is worldwide 

Bit difficult to correlate mass extinction I think 

Bit sort of negative rather than positive

Rather than correlation themes because you 're looking for their absence which is uh somewhat tricky because if they 're not there you don't know what it means 

Uh what else 

Which other bits do you think cope fundamentally 

Mm

The Cambrian 

The Cambrian

Cambrian what wh

Most of it

All Just the Cambrian in general is significant

Yeah I mean

Why

Well a at that time we thought the land was all s sort of slapped together

so therefore all the sort of deposits that are are there are going to be worldwide aren't they 

You got You got uhm Archaean shields all over the world haven't you

Yes  yeah 

Well haven't I have I not just answered your question or what

What do you want me to say

Well you 've said that the Arch You 've mentioned that we 've got Archaean shields that we 've got Cambrian  strata around the world but so what is what 's

why is that a fundamental division 

Well because it can be correlated worldwide

What can be correlated 

All the Archaean sediments 

Uh  I 'm not sure that 's true really

I mean uh  what 's so important about the

There is an int uh something interesting about the Cambrian that might lead us to believe that there is uh  something of significance there globally 

No

Is it the uhm the appearance of more complex life forms

Uh  certainly they are more complex

But what 's the characteristic of pre-Cambrian strata as opposed to ca post-pre-Cambrian strata

Pre-Cambrian are igneous rocks  predominantly 

The Palaeozoic 's more marked by sediments 

Well that 's what they use for dating anyway

Well I don't know

I think that may be an impression you get simply possibly because you 're seeing deeper levels of erosion in very old rocks

But I mean if you can go to South Africa and Australia and Canada and find uh pre-Cambrian flint stones these cherts and things like this which have got apparently some little faunal elements in them 

And you 've seen the torredonian

What 's the torredonian

What sort of rocks are they

Are they igneous



Well OK but I mean the the ones that they normally use to date

I don't know

In the book I read they 're not

But

Right but what

It said they normally date uh in the pre-Cambrian

They date using the igneous rock

Right but why do they date radio-metrically in other words

Cos there 's no fossils

three-or-four-words

No fossils

Exactly because there are no preserved fossils 

So there is a fairly fundamental division between the pre-Cambrian and the post-pre-Cambrian  in that all of the Palaeozoic strata have got fossils in them or generally they 've got fossils in them and in the era before they didn't

And there 's

But you pointed out something about the nature of the fossils that are preserved in Cambria  which is that they are 

Yeah

Mm

More complex

Yeah they 're

They 're very complex organisms aren't they

I mean the first things that we find

If you read uhm  There 's a new book by uhm Steven J Gould on the  shale which is quite interesting and the photographs and reconstructions although the the text is not all that enlightening I didn't think

And he 's they 're describing uhm  the  shale fauna and pointing out how exotic they were

And there were these weird organisms that are well preserved

Mm

Mm

Mm

Got sort of five legs and eyes coming out of their

Mm

Yeah exactly

All these things that are no longer didn't appear not to have continued in evolutionary terms

Uh  and  they suddenly appear in the records at that time and they were obviously sophisticated organisms 

Uhm 

so there was something happened at that boundary which is of significance although we don't know what it is

What others have we got 

We 've got two now 

Uhm Permian to Triassic 

Permian and Triassic 

Uh do you know anything particularly that happens at that interval

No I can't see why that 's such a big boundary

Not really

Mm

Well they 've got primitive plants and animals to more modern forms

At the Permian-Triassic boundary

Mm

Uh so th

So it 's flowering plants mammals and birds 

So in other words if you were to divide up the stratigraphic column today you would get  four  main divisions would it be 

Mmhm

Just uh makes stratigraphy a lot easier anyway doesn't it 

But uh might not tell us a great deal about the Earth 's history

Well let 's concentrate on some of those and see why some of those are so significant

What does anyone say on the Cretaceous cos that 's probably one you know more about in the sense of  more information around on this one recently 

What 's happened at the end of the Cretaceous 

David 

Well you have a mass extinction

We have a mass extinction

OK

First of all I think  relying on lecture notes alone is not enough for for any work you 're going to hand in 

Where  could you go to find out more material

How could you go about it

I mean I 've said this question to all of you 

There now you 've got to find out about the question of geology in London  of London in fact 

How do you find out more material about this  given that  could start helping you and  

There are loads of stuff on London in the uhm architecture room

How do you find out 

Libertas

What would you What would you type into Libertas

The geology of London

 And when you

And you got

I  down the 

On London there 's five thousand items eight thousand on geology

One item closely matches your theme

Exactly

Only it 's not quite 

I know

There are certain things Libertas is useful at

But unfortunately when you get a very big topic like Geology or London it really isn't very effective at sort of narrowing things down

The key words aren't very good in fact cos all the students taking out the titles everything with the word London in the title is going to go

What else could you do 

Try the 

Try the local provenance

Such as

Outer London



Yeah

And quite often the local libraries are actually better equipped because they 're providing a more general uhm sort of  you know supply 

What else

Anybody got any other ideas

 

On  Monday morning get that brain going 

Geology in London 

Do you need your caffeine fix before you  this 

No ideas at all though

Frank

Emma

Uhm  there 's a museum in  

Does the Geographical Museum have any books or anything

What 's the Geographical Museum

The Geological Museum

Sorry

It 's just beside the uhm Science Museum

You can buy geological maps from there

In fact the hydrogeological map of south-east England would be quite a nice starting-point 

Have you heard of The Times Atlas the one that they 've just come out with that 's got some very nice diagrams

I mean it 's got a summary page there wholly on the geology of the south-east England

It 's not very hot in the essay

It 's all diagrams but it 's very good to conceptualize uhm the structure 

Well you 've missed the most obvious one

I mean who do you go to

Who gave the lectures on this 

So why don't you knock on his door  

You 've You 've tried libraries

You 've tried Libertas

You know you you 've gone on the shelves

I mean the the simplest I mean usually the best starting-point is to go to the lecturer  who has actually taught about this topic and say can you advise me

Can you point me in the right direction

One thing 's for sure is that if that lecturer turns round and says no there 's nothing much written on that one all right at least you know that

I mean there isn't

You know you you 're not going to be sort of uh  rushing around looking for non-existent material

What happens is if there 's a lot of material you need to look into the geological memoirs and so forth but 

So  you go and have a word with Ron and probably John French as well I suspect 

Emma do you know do you know when his office hours are



They 're on the door

Uhm there are certain  hours 

OK

And

You should give us an idea of how you 're going to tackle that

And what what are going to be your your main  arguments

Well

I explained  briefly what  really is

Why

Uhm it 's not because and uhm

and which  

its uhm industries  uhm 

Uh  there are some countries where uhm  

What have you got there

A thousand words 

I mean there are there could be books over there on global warming certainly a hundred thousand plus

How 're you going to get this down

How are you going to How are you going to say anything sensible in a thousand words

Mm

 international so uh  uh law    if there is something done about it

otherwise some countries will do something  in some way

I 'm not de denying that you you you 've got ideas about it

but what I 'm really trying to do is see whether we can focus down



What  the answer oh global warming 

What what what are the topics that come to mind

do you know

The ocean level line

Mhm

Uhm growing season

 agriculture  to agriculture

So you 're going to the actual impacts of facts

What it means to me or

What are the grounds of that 

You Duncan

Uhm  perhaps one of these years I suppose is h how much uh

how much is is uh global warming actually occurring and how to how does one how does one measure it

Mhm



You can actually break it down into into different uhm  different aspects of global warming and different causes as as you perceive them

I mean the destruction of rain forests uhm  and things like that 

 wide-ranging 

 OK

So So you 're you 're really interested in the in the scientific side of it 

I 'm not

No

I 'm not really interested in that 

I 'm interested in   uh

Mhm

Is that what it would what it would  bring to mind or where your interest would lie if you had to go and do something about it yourself

No

I think mine would be the implications for for the individual countries 

Mhm



Impacts you mean

Yeah

And you

Yeah

The impact 's first the thing that springs to mind first

Mhm

I 'd try and pursue how much how much do we actually know 

Do you think you can do the impact before you know what the causes are 

Do you think we could actually discuss that 

What What are the impacts

What 

If you 

I mean you 're you 're going to save almost five years I 'm sure through your A-level this this whole part of it

What What What are the impacts going to be  

Sure

But do you do you have do you have a sort of a you know a feel for what 

There 's  under water

 That obviously rooted 



Well how how much is that

Is that is that uh two centimetres

Twenty metres 

That 's about a metre rise

Is that Is that the feeling people have who talk about it an or an order of a metre rise of water

More than that

Less than that 

Something like that

Yes

About a metre

I don't know 

No 

I remember someone saying to you Alec  that sea level rise is one thing 

Quite possibly



By how much



It doesn't actually have to rise that much

Isn't going to make a lot of difference

No 

No

Not at all

I wouldn't agree



Icecap water 

And then what about the actual amount of temperature rise

I mean how much how much has it risen over the last hundred years

I should think about two degrees 

Is there any any advance or any reduction in two degrees

It had fallen

Four degrees 

It had fallen

Fallen

Yes

Over the last a guess

Well it fell between nineteen thirty and nineteen seventy



Here we go 

So there 's been a reduction of that time as well

But simply if I took a starting-point as eighteen eighty and the end point as nineteen eighty  what would be the difference between the temperatures in those two dates

We 're talking about you know a ten degree rise a point and a half degree rise a one degree rise 

Any advance on that 

In fact  it fell by about point four but rose overall by about one degree

It has risen of that order of magnitude

The forecast rise in sea-level was twenty centimetres 

and the forecast rise in temperatures one point four degrees from now



Has this definitely been decided or is this just pure speculation

What 's the difference 

Is there any

I don't know actually  if there is

Whe When does it change

What 's the difference between a speculation and a definite statement

Speculation depends on the present the present trends

No



There 's no such thing as a definite statement 

 as you can when you measure temperature

ARK has The organisation ARK has said that sea-level will rise by one metre  if present pollution levels and conditions continue 

There 's a definitive  statement

OK

I say it will rise by two metres

Uhm 

But the Government of the U K in its nineteen ninety-one report has said twenty centimetres sea-level rise and one point four degrees centigrade increase

So if you like that is the definitive statement for the time being 

So if you go to the library  the report nineteen ninety-one looking at the impacts uhm on the basis of that 

Emma what are you going to write about  

Uhm  not individual countries but basically areas  

So a spatial variation of of change 

Uhm  yeah

Uhm well that 's the thing 

Uhm 

Yeah

I mean the point is you you can't write about impacts scientifically date likely scenarios  in a thousand words

It 'll just be a mishmash of a few points here and there

I think you need to focus now  on one aspect  whether it 's impacts whether it 's just temperature whether it 's rainfall

I I would not suggest you go for the spatial one because that 's the most contentious of all

I mean all areas in in Hertfordshire change compared to north-west Scotland

Uhm their resolution models just got greener 

No

I meant I meant Europe

I mean

Well they 've only really done simulations of five regions in the world

They haven't done The temperature they 've done for the whole world

but for temperature of upper Asian soil moisture there 's only been five selected regions of the  changes done

So I don't think you 'll have a I think you 'd be you 'd find it very difficult to be honest

Can you specialise if if there 's a very big wide topic can you specialise into one thing in the in the essay title

Yeah

The point is you can do what you like 

I 'm negotiating with you the title so that you 're choosing a title that I think you can produce coherently a thousand words

It 's because although you 'll be marked on style and presentation if it 's incoherent you don't get to the starting-point

If there 's no references if it 's not produced with some material of a of an academic nature then uhm that 's not good enough

So you can't put down drivel and just present it so that it 's all paginated nicely and you 've got nice margins or spacings and so forth and all the tab settings are right if it 's complete garbage 

And I I just feel that

Emma 's 

taking a topic there 's a lot in there

So I 'll I 'm going to urge you to try and focus down on a particular aspect whether it 's  carbon dioxide and and ignore C F Cs for instance

You could just choose the impact of the ozone layer

You could just look at rain forest

but don't try

and put all of those in

Is that what is required by the examiners

Yeah 

Exactly

No

Well that is this is the problem is that many of these exam questions on international problems are so huge that you can only tackle them by narrowing down the scope

But in the exam question you 'd expect to do fifteen hundred to two thousand

Of course you are concerned with a sort of notion of of uhm representativeness too aren't you so that the arm is exactly there  and that the  figure is positioned in exactly that kind of way in space 

and it is you know of a human being whereas David 's is  you know

by the colours you use you are also saying you know

I 'm not concerned with with uh a natural representation of the head

aren't you 

Both of you are doing something  completely different

So then what are you interested in David  because this is

Yes what do you paint 

I mean clearly everything you paint is a representation of something  you know and yet at the same time you say uh

Forgive me

Uhm I 'm sorry to kick this thing out of the way

Sorry 

By giving Patricia a grey skin  and and the yellow and the green in the face etc you 're saying this is not about  her real appearance 

No I think

What is it about representation that you 're interested in

I think it 's the structure

The structure 

And it 's the  creations

You couldn't cover very well for  cos you would argue I suppose  Miriam that you 're interested in a structure as well would you 

Yeah I I 'm quite interested in uhm trying to carve a figure by using paint uhm  so that you get a uhm a feeling of uhm a body being very solid

To paint an illusion uh of the three dimensional 

I mean it 's the same old problem with two dimensions  communicating two-dimensional objects 

It 's that kind of space that you 're interested in is it 

Yeah

Uhm I don't want to give an illusion

I I I want to try uhm  try and uhm just carve use use the use the paintbrush and carve out the figure and see what the end result is but I don't want to try and portray an illusion

I 'm just I 'm just happy with what uhm what the carving achieves 

Sorry

Why don't you use a 

If you want to carve why don't you why don't you just carve it  with carving tools and  

Uhm

I I find a challenge trying to  

I mean it 's not really carving

I think you can

You 're not carving it out of the paint 

Uh uh I think uhm  you can be you can use paint as a way of uhm  very similar to African sculpture 

I mean I don't achieve it here

but I think it is possible to achieve it

For example which painters are you talking about

Picasso his uhm

his masks are very very carved and he uses paint 

Uhm he does

he has this   one of three women at a window

and uhm I think it 's

There 's one holding a curtain back and the faces are very carved in that  and he uses paint 

I think that Miriam brought up an interesting point when she talked about tribal art or kind of primitive  uh notions of representation  which I think is  something that 's more applicable to David who 's because he 's you know approximated the notion of the head

He 's developed a sort of a you know a language

I mean each one of them looks as if they 've been run over by a steam roller

There 's a a a Renaissance painter whose pictures look as if they 've all been steam rolled and I can't think of who it is

 do you know



Somebody whose heads always always look flattened off

Who am I thinking of



Yes  yes

They look as if they 've all had a quick turn under the steam roller  uh and yours have that same quality in that you 've made up your decisions which  are  you know stylized

Patricia 's head can represent all heads  cos you know they 're almost a general voice for heads 

Is that what you 're talking about when you talk about structure whereas for Miriam it 's quite specific

I mean there are occasions within the  painting 

Do you see what I mean Matthew

Maybe it 's tribalist

David 's can be regarded as a  gesture whereas Miriam doesn't rely on light

Light 

And so I 'd say that Miriam 's is a night painting whereas David 's is a substance painting



No

see

I don't agree cos I think that  everybody has the same picture plane on the first side and then  particular side of the picture plane that is imposed on David 's painting 

No not at all

And uhm using the painting until you can see light

No I mean look look

David compositionally tells the whole  when he distorts the head in order so it will fit in

Squashes it

He 's making all sorts of decisions within this rectangle about the head which he believes important cos you know picture plane and colour and gesture etc he 's

he 's you know

There 's much

Maybe that 's to fit the canvas anyway

Yeah it 's an intimate thing isn't it

We 're almost You know forgive me Patricia

we 're almost close up to you

You know I feel I know you intimately whereas with with uh Miriam 's you know there is a distance you know

It 's iconoclastic kind of painting 

It 's not meant to be close contact or intimate 

It 's about distance and space 

The distance you know

We 're away from it  in an academic sense

So why why then would you see    pictures been steamrolled whereas I see  as somebody who uhm paints something in simplistic terms  a specific  Rembrandt is just time and space 

This idea of paint

He paints

Oh I agree with you then

I don't disagree 

I agree

So on that point you 'd say that Miriam 's pictures have far more representativeness than 

No no no

I just think that the way   's heads come out because of that they look more like David 's

You know they look  as if as if as if their space has been stretched whereas Miriam 's is is you know a fairly representational you know seeable kind of space

There 's very little distortion in the space 

Now I don't know why  did what he did uh

but frankly it was a sort of  wouldn't he

It was useful 

But you know that 's very very

Makes you think about it

You mention that

but if you a technical word the word substance

Substance

Yes

And I think that actually I hope  will talk to you about that although  the name 

But uhm I thought what was striking about David 's paintings is the physical tactile substance the way he uses the paint 

He 's very generous with the paint very strong physical person

and uhm 

and uh uhm use a bit more 

Uhm the way I sort of painted this picture is uhm I 'm very keen to to get uhm luminosity the light shining through and uhm have the background uhm and the figure almost sort of reacting with one another so the figure stands out and shocks you

And the way I 'm going about doing it is uhm I use a lot of turps and rub  rub the colour in into into the grey areas so I suppose that 's one of the reasons why it appears so luminous

Do you feel it worked

Uhm well I feel that uhm I do sometimes use thick paint but uhm I feel that you can kill the canvas and it 's very difficult to bring back this luminosity to it

It depends if the colours are uhm are dirty or not but uhm 

Would it be  

Yeah

How long have you been working on your green painting there

Uhm for about five weeks six weeks

You see there 's a danger with your painting the way you do in my opinion in that one could be sort of astounded by its virtuosity

Oh I wish people 'd stop saying that about David 

and uhm it 's not that good anyway

If I can continue  

That one could be astounded by your virtuosity and then  ending up with nothing else 

I 'm interested in the structure that you 're interested in

I mean one thing I would sort of ask you Miriam is this 

I don't know if I 'm how you agree with this but it seems to me that  you assemble the figure  over six weeks twelve weeks or whatever 

At a certain point the painting goes through uhm a sort of  stage two when you find you can pull the thing together 

 in that picture  or the other one you had downstairs  and that one

Now is I mean is this so or not 

Do you intend to assemble all the bits  and then at some point draw round the thing as a whole or find some simplified

No I 'm not actually aware of suddenly one day it all comes right

I just kind of uhm

but I do I do ignore a lot of problems

and say I want to fix this and get this right

and then I 'll go to this

so I I I know that uhm I haven't even started the uhm head at the moment

It 's very flat

and there 's a lot of things I 'm ignoring cos I want to get the structure of her bottom and her legs seated first of all 

and then I I I 'm not aware of all the problems coming together one day and suddenly it works cos it doesn't 

but uhm  I just ignore a lot of things until  

Mmm

Is it pleasure that makes you paint

Yeah although I do some paintings and I don't enjoy doing them but generally I continue painting if I 'm enjoying it

Mhm

It depends because you like to paint

Do you paint because you like painting

Yeah I mean 

In that small painting there are some very nice passages aren't there

This neck is is uh almost sharp 

the way it detracts from the form it 's almost like a

Here

Lovely form here 

I mean I would say this about both of you and I 'd say it about myself as well actually but I think you 're bad on colour 

Yeah I mean I think that uhm particularly in Miriam 's case

I mean you you cannot but see that in the context of Cezanne 

Cezanne would have found colour for the figure and the background and everything else and not such a sort of tonal uhm device that you 've used 

I mean it 's the same thing with David 's

I mean even though you 've sort of  very arbitrary about  a background colour

You started off with the cream colour for the skin

Course you work it in on the grey and you sort of you 're drawing with the paint 

 marvellous work 

I think  in both ways you 're quite similar

and I think  colour to be uhm

What do you reckon

I really hate the word background paintings like this cos they 're paintings not  

and they should work as flatness

and uhm t just I know it sounds

but uhm you should be thought of as just as one thing not as foreground and background

How do you 

No just me

but mos everyone most people say that to them

I just think maybe uhm sensation

I mean from what David said about colours uhm  in David 's painting it would be  the sensation from the tip of the nose to the lips to the cheekbone  to the grey background behind the hair

Which painting are you talking about

This one Wo

Works as a passage

Which one

the middle one

This the one next to the brown  with the yellow dress

Works as a passage but you actually have to uhm  spend time and just sit

You have to look at it to sort of see that 

And so on on those grounds I 'd say that those colour values in terms of being a painting  aren't fully realised

but  there is a sort of acute sensibility about the way they 've been put down  whereas I do believe that I that that eyebrow is the most fluid sort of eyebrow  sort of a one stroke which says more about the pocket of the eye  than it does about probably the r the whole of the rest of the painting 

What the top left one

Yeah it 's the top of the left eyebrow yes

In David 's

Yes And the neck is very good as well 

That 's a very sharp line

uhm we will first talk about what would happen if you cut a peripheral nerve

what would be the  effects of that

Would there be loss of sensory information which would happen in the example before us

Numb

Numbness

That 's right of course

Numbness in the region of the cut  that the area that the cut nerve innervates would be numb

And what else

uhm  well  you you wouldn't have any of the innervation over here so  so you you you would get loss of emotion loss of motion

Loss of movement

That 's right

Loss of movement

Movement in that area of course

Yeah  that 's fine

And one last thing I want to ask you is do you have any idea of what would be the effect on the actual muscle itself

If you  If you took a piece of the muscle and if you sliced it up and looked at it under a microscope and that muscle has been  denervated in other words the nerve has been cut

It would just be  would be relaxed

It would be relaxed

That 's exactly right

And And what would it actually look like 

Just what will the cells look like

Do you have any idea

They 'd be swollen up

Swollen up

Not swollen

but they 'd be  atrophied

The other way around

Atrophied

Yes

You were right they 'd be changed but they 'd be atrophied

They would be actually smaller and and a bit shrunken 

Yes

And what would actually happen with the  muscle tone

Muscle tone would be relaxed

Is that temporary or is does that

Right

So does everybody understand why it would be relaxed

You understand why it can't  mo why you can't move it

You understand that all of you

 the reason

What is it that normally provides

Can you sit down

Yes

Yes 

What normally provides the muscle  tone 

They I was going to say that they that they that they something to do with the vagus nerve

Not really because vagus doesn't go to to the uh striated muscle

What goes to the spine then 

Yes

But uh just thinking in terms of sort of coming out of here

Do you know what what what what what it is that provides

Do you all understand what tone is

It 's a

It 's a slight  It 's a slight uhm resistance

So that it isn't just a flaccid kind of floppy  piece like like this rag

If If you pick up uh uhm liv I mean muscle that 's uhm living muscle it 's got resists a pull

All right

But if it 's just floppy like at the butcher 's shop it doesn't

it 's like a rag

It 's lost its tone

OK

Now the tone is provided by the gamma motor neurons

Does anybody remember what the gamma motor neurons do what they innervate 



The The spindles don't they

That 's right

So the spindles are sitting in  in the muscle aren't they and they 're innervated by gamma motor neurons

And those gamma motor neurons have got what 's called a tonic firing

They 're firing all the time and they 're making the spindles contract  a bit and uhm 

What 's the effect of that 

What happens if you change the spindle lengths 

Uh the

The alpha motor neurons

And why do the alpha motor neurons   change

What What gives them information

Because there are thousands of the  

That 's right

That 's exactly what you should call what

Can you remember what they 're called 

One afferent

One A afferent

Lovely

That 's exactly right

So one A afferents which innervate the uhm which innervate the spindle are sensory afferents called one A afferents 

OK 

Will then feed on to the alpha motor neuron  and that will cause the muscle to be slightly contracted all the time

These gamma motor neurons are firing in a tonic sort of way all the time on to the muscle spindle

and they 're  that 's feeding back  one A afferents and causing the uhm alpha motor neuron to  slightly

So in other words your muscles all the time are in a slight state of contraction

So when this nerve is cut not only will you be numb in the area not only will the relevant muscles not be able to move

but the muscle will be all floppy through lack of tone

And it will also as you said slightly atrophy

Now what do I mean by atrophy

 it degenerates

Not specifically degenerates

It 's like the first thing it 's like it 's on its way to degenerate

but degenerating implies that they 're actually dying

uhm the cells don't actually die but the the the muscle cells become smaller and shrunken 

OK

And you would actually see it

uhm anybody who had any nerve damage uhm you 'd actually have muscles

Actually I don't know if any of you ever had damaged a nerve but it 's noticeable that the muscle which was innervated becomes uhm what people think of in layman 's terms as wasted 

But it 's

Mm 

I I 've I 've had that

You 've had 

So it is  

OK

So what happened then after a while

It didn't last forever I hope

Yeah

Yeah

No I had

I had a month 

Right

And then in time what happened was as you quite rightly say  this nerve degenerates as a result of the fact that it 's been cut off from its cell bodies

But in time it grows again 

And as it grows back so the sensation reappears  so the movement reappears  tone is recovered in the muscle and uhm  and the atrophy goes

The The The muscle begins to  

It 's helped by doing uhm some exercise to bring it back into its normal

Would the nerve actually regenerate itself

The nerve regenerates

That 's exactly right

It grows from the cut end across back to the tissue again

Now if if the uhm if when you cut a nerve and you look at the target of that nerve and in this case we 're talking about muscle and that target appears to  become uh to die slightly I mean not actually die but become wasted what what does that tell you about the interaction between nerves and their targets

uh 

Yes

N G F is a good

You 're sort of jumping a bit ahead

I mean what does it actually tell you about

So if if when you cut a nerve the target which innervates that nerve  begins to show changes coming back it should 've become weaker and smaller what does it tell you about the normal function of the nerve on that target

Well apart from stimulating it it has a role as those blood vessels carry uhm blood or other things

So it has an essential role in its its survival then

Right

Exactly

And how would you how would you express it

What d' you kind of role do you think that is

That 's right

It 's doing something more than just exciting the muscle and making it contract isn't it

It 's needed for the normal maintenance and health of the muscle

Do you know what word is used to mean that something is life-giving or supportive in its function

Growth factor

Growth factors come into this but there 's a ge general word which is called trophic

Trophic

Oh yes

OK

So nerves have a trophic action on muscles

They don't simply just make muscles work  they actually keep the muscle healthy

And therefore in the absence of the nerve the muscle becomes weaker  and  there 're actually metabolic changes in the muscle

Its ability to to grow and utilise glucose and do all the things that healthy cells do change in the absence of a nerve

So So you mean that it 's the nerves that feed them

Nerves feed them

Exactly

That 's exactly right

There 's some kind of feeding process that goes on

Now we don't exactly know what that feeding process is

uhm we really don't

And it 's a two-way process because in fact the muscle is providing the stimulus to the nerve

So we 've got the nerve is having a kind of trophic action on muscle but ma muscle actually also a a a acts in a trophic way towards the nerve

But let 's just stick with the nerve affecting the muscle for the moment

We don't We just simply don't know what that effect is

All we know is that nerves do have a particularly important role uh o on the maintenance of their targets

It 's more important in some tissues than in others 

A good example of where it 's absolutely essential is in the taste buds of the tongue which 're renewed all the time 

but if your tongue is denervated if the nerve to your tongue is cut then the taste buds  are stopped being renewed all the time

So there 's a sort of very very very definite thing that you can measure there

Whereas in other tissues like let 's say skin denervated skin is in fact tends to be uhm a little bit thinner and slightly more sort of shiny in appearance

but it 's it 's not a lot different from innervated skin

So some some target tissues uhm it 's it 's more apparent than others 

If a nerve A question

if a nerve doesn't regenerate  what happens to the muscle eventually

Does it atrophy

Oh but it does regenerate

I mean nothing could stop it regenerating unless unless uhm in an experimental situation you actually actively stopped it by say tying a great big knot in it or something

But I mean in a normal situation it would

If if if If in an experimental situation you did try and not allow it to regenerate then interestingly enough the nerve would atrophy sorry the muscle would atrophy to a certain point and no further

So there 's it 's not a total dependence on the nerve

it 's a partial dependence 

OK

Now I said that there also

Sorry did somebody else want to ask something

What does the degener the regeneration depend on

Right

Exactly

So you were asking about N G F

Now there 's also an interaction the other way round so that this regeneration that I was telling you about where the cut nerve grows back uhm is dependent on again trophic factors coming from the target

And a very important trophic factor is called N G F or nerve growth factor 

A nerve growth factor is released particularly from denervated target tissues and encourages  the nerve to grow

The nerve grows much more effectively in the presence of  growth factor 



Yes

From the actual target tissue which in this particular case we 're talking about is muscle but it could be any target tissue which is denervated

It 's released by it and then to to help it to grow back to that source 

Right 

So  let 's move back a step then or or back towards the central nervous system and think

now what would be the effect uhm if we uhm keep the nerve intact but we cut uhm a dorsal root 

And uhm Marilyn  could you please answer that

All right

Hmm

Could you tell me please

what would happen if uh  if if if if you cut the dorsal root



Right

Good 

uhm so what would that mean

 the output

Isn't that right 

Why could you not have any motor output

I mean  if if if it was present 

  interact

Right 

You 've got no sensory input

You answered that quite right 

So that means that the skin  yes  could have an area of now let 's see

The muscle would no longer be changing its one A afferent input in would it

So what would that have

What effect do you think that would have

Any questions about what we 've been doing so far cos that 's a natural break

The Uhm the 

you did yesterday

How How did that lump feel cos it was it was deep

It was so deep that most of these characteristics you couldn't  you couldn't accurately define 

Uh I got the impression looking back at it now I got the impression that it was a small lump  which had no particular shape and which was firm 

It wasn't attached to skin 

it did not seem to be attached to uhm  or external  

and there were a-few-words-muttered

She had a history as you know of having had an attempt to remove the lump previously and they found that it was very  to the nerve 

This was because they hadn't been allowed to do a proper operation

You remember she had insisted that they only do a small incision under local anaesthetic

Of course they should never have done it

They shouldn't have a-few-words-muttered

and uh

so as you saw we really ought to get it out  uh  deeper because  it was few-syllables the nerve

It was a deep lump 

but uh what was the whole principle of the operation meant to be

and one which I don't  entirely subscribe to in the end 

To get the lump out alone or 

To get the lump out alone

Uh I might have been very bad in my explanation

No it was saving the facial 

Pardon

It was saving the facial nerve and also uhm removing the tract where the previous operat operation  uhm

That 's true yes

I remember I mentioned that you had to remove  the incision which had been used previously  because it had to be assumed to be contaminated with a tumour

The reason why I said it had been contaminated with a tumour was that in the previous operations which part of the tumour had been removed

And the whole point of the operation that we were doing was to try to get the widest possible margin of normal tissue all round  because  while so-called benign parotid tumours are benign in the sense that they do not appear  to want to spread by the bloodstream   glands  they have this nasty tendency to  to the wound 

The cells are broken off  

so I wasn't able to do as good an operation as I would have wished  on that lady 

but I did the best possible without destroying her facial nerve as you could see  the facial nerve

There 's no question

And if I had sacrificed the facial nerve I mean in the normal way without a previous first operation I would have sacrificed those two branches of the facial nerve that were very tightly apposed to the lump 

But my reasoning was as follows

She has already had tumour disseminating from the previous operation almost certainly 

so  to sacrifice the facial nerve now  and risk dissemination now would probably make no difference to recurrences in the long term 

and she will have failed to have a bit longer of uhm uh uh normal facial nerve function  normal in relation to the muscles muscles of facial 

So that was my reasoning

but don't get thinking that that 's the right sort of operation

It wasn't

Normally I like to I like to never see the lump 

I don't want to see the lump 

I musn't see the lump

All I see is the normal tissue all round it  and the management of a lump in the parotid region  because you can't do this preliminary biopsy business  is to cut the lump out  with the widest possible margin of normal tissue 

The preservation of the facial nerve  provided the circumstances of the operation permit by which I mean provided  the lump isn't growing into the nerve 

It 's difficult  but you will decide 

But did she have general swelling of the gland  no

It was just a tumour in the gland 

What was the reason for not  wanting the general the first time

Was it just the scars or

On that lady

Oh she 's as mad as a hatter

Oh well

I mean she she answers yes to everything

Have you taken a history

No no I 'm sorry

Oh go and take a history 

Go on

Do yourself good

Go

and take a history  because she 'll answer yes to every question you ask her 

Oh yes she has 

she has 

she has 

She can't lie flat

Oh yes

She had the anaesthetists so worried they didn't want to give her the anaesthetic  until we  reassured her

We showed her a letter in the in the notes

You see as far as she 's concerned she has the most terrible reactions to anaesthesia

She can't have anaesthetics 

but we had a letter from a consultant anaesthetist in the other hospital to say she 's perfectly able to have anaesthetics

That reassured our anaesthetists here 

They nearly said they weren't going to op let me operate on her

As you know she had the anaesthetic without  turning a hair 

There was a point in your lecture you gave us  uhm on a lump in the parotid region 

You mentioned that any lump should be excised 

Would you refer  uhm that to a palpable lump rather than just a  swelling

Oh yes

You see  as I explained there on that diagram  if you get  a swelling of the whole gland  it can't be a tumour  because you can't visualize a tumour growing differentially in different directions so as to reproduce the shape of the gland 

So what sort of lesions do you have 

Well constructive lesions  stone in the gut  ascending infection  all producing a swelling in the whole gland  

Syndrome 

Have you heard of  Syndrome

Yes

Now  Syndrome produces

Well we don't know the nature of the disease but it certainly produces attacks of ascending infection  and it in any case produces a hardening of the glands and indeed if it doesn't swell it becomes palpable 

So those are not necessarily any of them indications for removing the parotid  but you get a lump in the parotid and then it 's ninety-five per cent liable to be a parotid tumour  and therefore it must be removed because although ninety-five per cent of them are benign  five per cent are not spreading by the lymph nodes  

You don't know  whether it 's one of those or whether it 's one of the five per cent that are malignant  so you 've got to remove it

You can't find out by a preliminary biopsy because you only spread it around if it is malign and hence make a an eminently curable neoplasm incurable 

And so you 've got to  normal tissue

So that was the reason for my advice for a lump in the parotid region as distinct from a swelling of the whole gland 

So a tumour could never cause swelling 

Could a tumour not cause obstruction and hence swelling

I 've heard of a tumour causing uh uh swelling by obstructing the main parotid duct 

All I can say is I 've never seen it myself

It must be very very rare

Stone yes  tumour no 

Sounds like if those tumours aren't very radiosensitive then  or very chemosensitive

Not at all  not at all

In fact  there 's evidence that all uhm X-rays due to so-called benign parotid tumours just make it more likely to go malignant

You know there is a tendency for malignant change anyway  and one of the reasons for removing a benign parotid tumour is that it may go malignant  in twenty years ' time or so 

Of course also it 's fair to say that as it grows if it 's growing slowly all the time it 's making the operation for saving the facial nerve technically more difficult 

Why is it not radiosensitive

Why is it not radiosensitive 

Science cannot answer the question why

Never can it

It can only answer the question how 

Now the how is that tumours which grow slowly are less radiosensitive than tumours that grow rapidly 

so the benign tumours or the more benign tumours tend to be radioresistant

and the more malignant tumours tend to be radiosensitive 

But why 

Well you need a philosopher there 

you know it 's a great mistake to think that science can tell you why something happens 

Yeah

Right

Mmm

I 'd have thought it being in such an easily accessible site under the surface and so close to the surface you could do something locally  some sort of local treatment

but there 's nothing at all you can do  into the the region of the tumour 

Nothing at all to

Well that 's what I 've said about  the tumour

You just spread it around 

You wait

On this firm I guarantee in five six weeks you will see three patients in out-patients who 've been sent up to me having had an inadequate operation for a lump elsewhere

and I 'll 

Usually it 's a multiple recurrence and then it becomes much more difficult to save the facial nerves

You can't save the facial nerves

And all the time the patient is in more and more risk of  developing cancer 

Yes  you might think you could

but the fact is in our present state of knowledge you can't 

and unfortunately there are a lot of surgeons around  who don't realise that and who fiddle around with local operations and things like that putting needles into the  and so forth

That 's all very well isn't it when you 've got  cases where you haven't got to worry about  what you 're going to leave

but when you get things like breast change obviously the cosmetic side comes into it more

Uh uh when you get things like what sorry

Well if you get uh say uh a  of the breast then it 's obviously more difficult cos you 've got the consideration to take

You can't be so radical can you in your approach

Well

Well well I mean that is the modern trend as you know to do lumpectomy and major therapy for  of the breast

but  a friend of mine called Professor George up in uh Glasgow has recently done a study  in which he 's analysed  uh the psychological disturbances and so on produced in women with  of the breast  comparing two groups one in which a mastectomy was performed and another in which lumpectomy was performed 

What do you think I 'm going to tell you

You 're going to say that the the people who had the mastectomy probably had a better prognosis than the ones that had the lumpectomy

Not prognosis

No they 're happier with it aren't they

They were happiest 

They were happy  and the answer is you see people have always assumed that  women are confirmed are concerned about the deformity produced by a mastectomy 

Now there are several answers to that

One is that they may be more concerned in fact about what how good a chance of cure they 've got 

Do you see what I mean 

I mean you speak to most doctors for  of the breast 

and they 'll say

well you know let 's have it in the bucket  the sooner the better 

And the other is that deformity  of a partial removal  uh a lump on the breast can be considerably more difficult to disguise  than a mastectomy

Mmm

Right

The prosthesis that you can wear if you 've got 

You can't have a prosthesis  that 's worth its weight of gold worth its weight at all with a deformed breast  but with the breast removed you can have a beautiful prosthesis 

No no

Mmm mmm

So it 's it 's

I mean I think that you 'll find that although the pendulum at the moment has swung completely over to the side  of uh local treatment for cancer of the breast I think you 're going to find that that 's a tendency which will come back again

Mmm 

But that opinion though is one is one that 's been brought by patients that 've had the operation

If you ask them before they go into the theatre do they want a total  mastectomy or a lumpectomy they 'll probably say

a lumpectomy

 people who 've had the operation rather than before 

so they 've got

you know you 've got a sort of retrospective view rather than one that 's looking forward  which is probably I think

Yes

Right

Where are shares traded 

At the Stock Exchange

The Stock Exchange

The Stock Exchange

It controls the trading of shares in public companies

and if you break the rules

I mentioned You remember I mentioned that the panel consists of representatives of The Bank of England the banks The old Stock Exchange and other financial institutions 

So the Stock Exchange will suspend trading in your shares  if you break the rules on a takeover 

If a bank plays fast and loose with the rules 

What do you think will happen  in a takeover if the bank  does naughty things like funding secret purchases of shares 

Same thing

You get struck off the Stock Exchange

Well banks don't require  trading in their shares  but banks do require something in order to practise in order to be a bank





No not 

A licence

A licence

They require a licence

If the City Panel  on Takeovers  rules that a bank has broken the the code  financial rules

Where does the licence come from 

I think from the Department of  

It 's actually The Department of Trade and Industry

The Secretary of Trade and Industry will act on the recommendation of the City panel

This is extraordinary

Here 's a private body  u upon whose advice the minister acts to remove a statutory licence 

Makes a definition of government   difficult to say the least when you see private bodies exercising public regulatory power governmental power

So the definition of government is is is not an easy one

What we are trying to get you to realise is that defining government as parliament or the legislature  the executive in the form of government departments and civil servants in the ministries is a in modern corporatives in Britain is a very difficult  thing to do to say that that 's all that government comprises

We have to look rather more widely  in terms of the constitution of what constitutes government or what the constitution regulates 

What are the most powerful organisations  in our political system 

Have a guess 

The pressure groups

I am thinking of  three or four particular pressure groups  particularly trade unions

The E M A

Sorry

E M A

Again that 's like a a trade union only a professional organisation

But getting back to the political to the directly political 



No we 're not involved in in that side of politics 

 parties

 parties

Parties

Political parties 

Surely our constitution ought to include  political parties 

We are asking about

They 're not government  but they play a very influ influential role 

It 's interesting that our legislation nowhere in legislation will you find a political party mentioned

They don't exist  As far as

As far as legislation is concerned they don't exist 

What role do they play in in in our constitution

And where are they mentioned 

When we talked about rules and legal rules  I wanted to expand your idea of what constitutes the the rules or the  the things which govern constitutional behaviour

Where will you find the parties mentioned 

In the legislation of the electoral system

No

They 're not mentioned in the legislation at all



If the Government starts 

Well there there is reference to the the leader of Her Majesty 's opposition to one of the salaries uhm legislation but it doesn't refer to a party

It just says  the leader of the legislatives ' loyal opposition

It doesn't mention a political party

Is the  the same as the Queen

and should 

Well that 's that 's a convention that 's a convention about the non-withholding of royal assent

Yes

Although the Queen technically in law has the right to withhold  convention says that she doesn't

And no monarch since Queen Anne in nineteen seventeen O two has disobeyed that convention

But  you were you suggesting that parties could be found in in constitutional conventions 

Yeah 

Uhm where

Can you Can you give an illustration of where a party  matters in in constitutional convention

 saying to John Major that he can't go into one of the the houses party 

conventions ruling that the actual head of the Conservative Party  in power

Uhm there are conventions that stop him from doing so 

Well those are conventions about being Prime Minister

Yeah

How is the Prime Minister selected 

Through

Through his party

Through his party  

Labour Party

The trade unions

Membership I mean membership of the Labour Party 

Pro pro 

The lead

Elections

Well the leader of the party is elected by the political party  whatever the definition of the constituency of that political party is is uhm

It differs from party to party

In the  Labour party it 's now a an electoral college comprising the  uhm  trade unions parliamentary Labour Party and the constituency Labour Party

In the Tory Party it 's only the parliamentary Labour Party

Members of the Tory Party in their constituencies have no say whatsoever nor does big business who pays

Uhm only the parliamentary  uh party has a say in the election of the leader

In the Liberal Party it 's it 's one member one vote

And every single member of the sorry Liberal Democrat  Party

every single member has has a right to to vote in the election of the leadership

So each party has its own different rules for election of its leader

But how does this relate to the choice of Prime Minister 

Through election

Sorry

Is there election

Well 

How do we choose our Prime Minister

We have an election and and what

By electing the party the head of the party becomes becomes Prime Minister  automatically 

No

But how is the Queen required to

The Queen has to  call somebody into Buckingham Palace and say

please form a government

The amount of seats

The amount of seats

Yes

The amount of seats what

Gained by taking the party who has the higher majority in the House

Whoever has the majority of seats that party will form Government

And the head of that party forms the Government becomes the Prime Minister

The The official convention is actually that the person who can command the support of the majority of members of the House of Commons is entitled to become Prime Minister and form a government will be asked to become Prime Minister and form a government

But in practice as a consequence of parties ' uhm electing in one way or another their leaders uh there are arguments now that the convention has become that the leader of the party  commanding the support of the majority in the House of Commons shall be asked to form a government

The problem with that of course is that parties may not have a majority 

But when you really do start going back to the person who commands the majority

Also given the way that some of the members some of the leaders are elected

Couldn't happen with the Tories because quite clearly a Tory party leader would have the support certainly the party leader would have the support of the members of the parliamentary party because that 's their electoral process 

But the Labour Party  the parliamentary Labour Party only has twenty-five percent of the vote in selecting  the leader of thirty-three percent 

It could very well be therefore that the leader of the Labour Party while he commanded the support of the trade unions and the the constituency party would not have the support of the parliamentary Labour Party

and even if the Labour Party won an election and had a majority of seats in the House that particular party leader wouldn't have the support of the parliamentary Labour Party and therefore wouldn't command the majority of the House of Commons 

It could happen 

Several articles in Public Law over the recent years uh  would suggest that as a consequence of that system we might well have a leader of the Labour Party who would not  uh be able to be asked  to kiss hands as they say uh 

I don't see why it couldn't happen to the Tory party

Isn't that That 's not what happened last year when Margaret Thatcher was dethroned  

Yes 

But the new leader had the support of the parliamentary Tory Party the parliamentary Conservative Party 

So therefore he was once he was elected leader he would automatically be asked to be uh Prime Minister by the Queen

Uhm whereas the Queen might be faced with a situation at some future stage where because of ructions within the Labour Party uhm a disagreement between the trade unions and the National Executive over  uhm industrial policy for example

The the The Labour Party refuses to repeal all the Tory or the trade union laws

Uhm the National Executive the the parliamentary executive refuses to change those laws and the trade unions say right we 're not going to support you

And they elect somebody else  as the leader of the party who doesn't command the support of the parliamentary party

Could happen

So the covention clearly is now going to involve parties

That 's the first time that parties 've actually become involved in the constitution  officially involved uhm through convention 

So even if we try to say that the constitution is that body of of rules we discovered that it 's not just rules it 's 

it 's systems electoral systems within parties  institutions and the way those institutions there are run and governed internally

It involves private bodies

Government can involve private bodies exercising public power

That 's the relevance of  

It is very important to distinguish between public and private power as well as public and private institutions public law and 

Those institutions have the exercise of public power even by private bodies 

Now we 've said so far that it consists of the constitution consists of rules 

What stops a Prime Minister  or government  from  passing discriminatory legislation 

What What stops a government for example from disenfranchising Catholics or Jews or blacks

Well the law 

Well the Parliament is supreme

It can't be the law

We don't have a constitution which stops  government from legislating certain things

We don't have a constitution which says

Congress shall pass no law restricting the freedom of press

or Congress shall pass no law uhm discriminating against religions 

That 's the First Amendment

Considerations I mean

Consideration

Consideration for

What sort of

Consideration for the uh the idea that  the public  wouldn't really  appreciate that kind of legislation

It might cause an outcry or something

Cos the House of Lords couldn't stop it  and the Queen could only stop it in  a very extreme case

You know

Are you serious

Yeah I am serious

If the uhm If the Government was to do something like that people would stop it other people 

In an ideal democratic society if the Government was to propose a a an action like it  of some sort it 's the people who would let their uh the elected members of parliament know and the elected members of parliament would vote that way in the House of Commons

So it should be the parliamentary members that stop the Government

All right

uhm I was reading your paper but I want to read it again  properly

Uh but I 've got a few questions  mostly relating to lexical phonology that might be uhm

I 've done lots of bitty things this week

nothing sort of very exciting

Sure

Yes

That 's fine

That 's fine

There are weeks when bitty things are the most productive 

And there are weeks when you can get stuck down you can get down down to earth

Mm

Yeah 

Well that that 's good

Well you get used to that

It 's a new way of working for you

You can't anticipate because you 'd find it  slightly odd at first

It is

Yeah

Mm

Yeah

It 's nice because you can fit it to how you feel you know

But I I really like that because I like working late 

And uh  I in fact I 've taken to working

sort of I do an hour before I get up   because if I do an hour before I get up  I then have feel I 've already started and I feel very positive and I can slip back into it

But if I haven't done anything I find it really difficult to sit down so   

And I tend to do bits late morning and then work late  late much later

Not too much in the afternoon 

Uhm  but I I have an intention of doing a hell of a lot more from now on and and doing 

Mhm

Mhm

Mm

Do you

Seems very reasonable

Fair enough

Mm

You 'll find it much easier when the place is emptied at Christmas

And at this weekend that happens everybody 's furious

It 's bizarre 

And you won't notice it so much except in college  because in the department a lot of people are graduates anyway so y you know once you 've seen a face 

I mean in college it 'll be funny 

Very nice though 

Yeah yeah

Mm 

Yeah  

Yeah

Mm 

Yes 

Yeah 

Mm

Uhm  uh  as I was wondering about simple  

I know and uh



Yeah 

I mean I haven't got any 

I was wondering about simple as well like for about the last eight years or so

Yes 

Well I don't think language is simple

so that 's that one out of the window

 peculiar

And with Lass I mean Lass nineteen ninety the acceptation thing put in uhm  Journal of Linguistics where he says that languages are just sort of cobbled together

They 're bits of old things left over and cobbled together

They are not perfect and they are not predictable 

Uhm and yet well that sounds about right to me

Mm

Mm

Mm

I used to really think that uhm  languages did have to be simple

I mean I don't think that you should go the whole hog  and try and come up with the most complex linguistic theory that you can conceivably come up with full of sort of knobbles and accretions because it strikes me that language isn't like that either

There are irregularities 

And you 've got to recognise the things that are regular and things that are completely irregular and suppletive

But there is a difficult set of things in the middle that are neither 

And that 's where I have trouble and I think that 's where  has trouble  where you want to capture relationships but only between a few items for instance 

I mean as for you it 's easier since Warren name set up a rule 

Mm

And if we write anything that doesn't fit in directly

Uhm  it 's equally easy in a non-declarative model

you just set up everything and rely on it in a sense

Uhm  but it isn't so easy in a model like this where you 're trying to peer down on the  and stuff we have

But there 's things in the middle oh I don't know like uhm  some strong verbs for instance that you might want to say are not outrageously different from one another

but it 's not rule-governed

I mean in a queer way you 've got to have some notion of morpho-lexical rules or something like that 

But that hasn't been worked out yet 

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm

Mm

Yes

Mm

Mm

I know

Mm

I 've written something only I 'm not sure I agree with it any more  

Uhm   the only word which we can consider simple valid  the term simple valid is by asking  is by  assuming I think simple refers to the universality of the statement

Mm



Mhm

That 's one way of interpreting it

Another way is of interpreting it is to see it in terms of what speakers do or what languages do  by which I mean uhm how speakers learn or how they process about which we know a limited amount  or uhm how languages change 

Uhm  so universality is one of several possible interpretations assuming we 've grown out of counting features which I hope to God we have by now 

But I think that we haven't in the sense that we have just classification still  because Anna Name seems to me to be counting features

You know that 's what  really means to her the same as it meant to Chomsky and Halle 

So anyway 

If you want to answer on simple come back in you know forty years or so 

Mm

Mm

Mm 

Mm

Mm

We have

Yes

Yes

Mm 

Yeah 

Yes

Yes 

Yeah

I 'll do that 

So do you think the answer is to def define it for one 's own purpose and go and use that

What frightens me also is defining it for your own purpose because obviously I 'm going to define it in a different way

Right

Yeah

But as long as that 's all right because you know what you 're doing you wrote in a given  paper or something like that 

Yeah 

I mean by simple in that paper I mean coherence with external evidence 

And by external evidence I mean what speakers do and what languages do  across time and synchronically 

Uhm  and I don't mean  simple counting simple manipulation 

But normally you can see that that 's fudging 

Mm

And you can   which is why it scares me to death

Mm

Mm

Mm

Probably is fudged isn't it

so

Mm 

You know well that was that one  

Sorry

It It 's a bit awkward if you 're that unconstructive in that sort of thing  

Uhm  oh yes

Oh that was a comment that you  went on to talk about anyway so

Oh good

As long as I go on to talk about it

There are several of those  

Uhm

Perhaps my mind works in a rather unstructured way

No

It seems seems to work 

Uhm I mean I 'm not saying I 've got the same ideas as as you  the same good ideas as you

But uh what what I mean is that that all the things I thought of you then went on to answer 

so uhm  without sounding as if I 'm grovelling or anything

Sure



Good

No

Nonsense 

I mean I do that all the time when I 'm marking people 's essays

And it gets it may get  maybe irritated after a while

They say

well why didn't you read it through first 

But you can't

You know you can't do it all the time

Mm

Yeah yeah



Yeah

Yeah

This was a first read so

Uhm  oh yes languages that are similar 

Yes

Right

You answered that one 

That 's the rest

Now there was something else though uhm on the lexical phonology bit uhm  which I 'm just starting to read

I 'm I 'm reading those two  uhm  but I haven't got anything to say 

Sure

Good

Bearing in mind that there are actually two competing theories to some extent which is Mohan and uh

Actually I mean this sounds again like  pushing my own stuff  but I wonder if it would help if I gave you my thesis 

Right

Yeah

Mhm

I should think so

Mm

Uhm  I mean it isn't necessar not all of it is going to be useful to you 

And I would pick around it to some extent 

But uhm  when are you going away

Mm

Mhm

Uhm  well Professor Greenbaum has got chicken pox so  I 'm not going to his party because it 's cancelled

So uhm  that I 'm not going on

I was going Sunday night you see but I 'm I 'm not anymore

I 'm going Tuesday uhm  because there 's the U C L Linguistics Society  uhm  Christmas dinner to which one 's in invot invited as an honorary member  

Uhm so that 's then

And then I 'm coming back Sunday 

Uhm  I  I 'm going to do  couple of days ' work in the Survey and come back Sunday and see and see if

In fact I 'm cat-sitting on Yeah I forgot that I 'm cat-sitting Friday night and Saturday night  so I 'm coming back Sunday  because my parents are coming to collect my sister  so I 'll come back with them

And then I 'm going to be here for another week until just before Christmas  so I thought that was the best way to do it

What

Yeah

That 's right

Mhm

Oh good

Oh my God

Yeah

Mhm



Oh

Right

Mhm

Right

So supposing when you come back on Sunday or say the Monday or something supposing you come in and get the thesis  would you feel able to have at least a look at it in that week and then give it back to me

I get paranoid about it

You see it 's like a baby

You know it just sits there on the shelf uh

I don't like to give it away for too long

It 's stupid isn't it 

And it 's all on the computer  

Goodness knows it took me long enough to actually think about handing it in in the first place

Mhm

Right

Yes

I 'd like to

Yeah

No

I don't blame you 

Not really no

 Is it

Is it bound like a book

It 's there

That black thing

Oh on the shelf

Mm

 

It 's a bit huge

This is the problem

But there will be bits of it that you don't want to know  about

Uhm  but there is just

All I 'm thinking about really at the moment is there 's an introductory chapter which talks about all the different versions of lexical phonology there are  and talks about what we might prefer and for what reason 

And there 's about seventy pages of that 

And that might be an ideal

Mm

Yeah

Right

That would fit in nicely  yeah with this 

Well it it helps you with Mohanan because Mohanan and his circ Kiparski and Mohanan diverging wildly and on some things like morphological representations and that and it might just help you approach some 

And the rest of it you can ignore largely because you 've got the papers that are now up to date versions of it

And a lot of it 's very dull because I I go through uhm  Halle and Mohanan and Chomsky and Halle and Halle nineteen seventy-seven paper on  and just basically take them to bits 

Mm mm

Mm

Definitely

Yes

Yeah

Mm

Mm

Yeah

I 'll do that then

So

But during that week maybe you could just look at the first chapter 

And it would be revision by then because you 'd have read quite a lot on this

Mm

uhm yes

Yeah

So it 'll be reasonably swift

Fine 

Right this is general sets

and has uh visited including A and B here and we know these are differentiable

Now what 's what 's the sort of condition

I mean you if you imagine a function which is just

We can draw a which is

If you got you got a

If it  goes up like that and then it starts going down you 've got a problem 

right

So wh what 's what 's the condition



Mmm mmm



What uh space  

Strict yeah

It 's meaningless

Pardon



Strictly increasing or decreasing

Strict Strictly the increasing or decreasing 

OK that 's

That 's the condition so

And once it 's strictly increasing or decreasing o over that then it 's certainly one to one

There 's no problem is there

Because if you have  F X one  is equal to F X two  and X one doesn't equal X two  say X one is strictly less than X two  then you know that F X one  is less than F X two cos it 's strictly increasing 

So when you have a differentiable function which is basically they 're not always like that it could be a continuous function

but then the function has got to be increasing 

And in fact it 's also true for continuous functions

You can then show that it must be increasing or decreasing

So if it 's continuous you can't  jump up like that

OK 

Because it wouldn't be continuous there

So it 's actually a proper increasing function 

OK 

So for example if you wanted to supposing you 're looking at sine X  and you wanted to define  an inverse to sine X  I mean how are you going to do that how are you going to do that

That 's neither increasing nor decreasing

What are What What have you got to do

What 's the strategy

Mmm

You have to limit 

Just You have

You have to limit it

You can only find an inverse for certain bits

And what sort of bits have they got to be





Between the maximum

So it 'll be between 

Yeah

So one place would be here

Why 's that

Because the function 's increasing there

Equally as well we could do it between here and here  or you could do it between here and there

So there are lots of different ways you can find an inverse of sine

but  the standard one is to take it from minus pi by two  to plus pi by two

OK 

So now we 're coming back to X cubed

And why are you stuck on that

You 're very good on this

so what I want you to be stuck on is F X equals X cubed

F  sends R to R  and X goes to X cubed

Well why 's that

Yeah

Cos

What 's the question

Right

Now

What 's the question please

Ah what 's the question

Show that the functions defined by F X by X goes to X cubed has an inverse K minus one but show that K minus one is not differentiable at zero 

OK

Well let 's first of all show it

What How can we show it 's an inverse 

It 's bijective cube

Cube

Well all right

So we 've got to prove it 's bijective 

How we going to prove it 's bijectal 

And you 're allowed to draw a picture of you 're allow and you draw you 're allowed to draw a picture if you want 

It 's increasing

So how do we prove it 's increasing 



It 's increasing

Uhm  general

The 

Uhm that that 's the definition

but how would you actually do it

X uh X one is greater than





Yes but how would you do it

If this was A level you 'd be writing  



What  

for X 

You you 've got a defrent You 've got a differentiable function

and when do you know a differentiable function is increasing 

Oh if it 's less than nought

If when you differentiate it it 's 

So So you look at its derivative

Right

And if that 's greater than nought then you know it 's a strictly  

So  F dash of X  is equal to three X squared 

It 's greater than nought so if X equals nought that doesn't matter

So you 've got a nice increasing function and you know you 've got an increasing function 

OK

Now how do you know 

Right it 's increasing so  it increases  so it 's indefinite  in one model 

OK 

Now how do you know what that functions on to 

It 's something that we were doing two or three weeks ago 

It 's defined for every X

and what I 'm saying is  that if you like here 's here 's your first bar along here 

and this function is mapping this over here

So here 's your second bar

How do I know that every point from here comes from a point down here

When we draw the graph it 's obvious isn't it

You sit there and you have a look at it

It 's obvious 

and of course anything that 's obvious in analysis there must be a proper rational proof for

So now what what sort of theory are we going to try and prove that with 

Mmm

Theorem minus three

Theorem minus three 

What does that say 

What What do you know about X cubed as X tends to infinity 

It tends to infinity

So this F X tends to infinity right 

And supposing I take a value K  and I want to know if F X affects that value

Right 

Well from X greater or equal to X  we certainly have a value where F X  will be greater than K 

OK

Let 's call it F X two 

And we also know because when X tends to minus infinity X cubed tends to minus infinity there 'll be another place where F X one is strictly less than 

Because X cubed tends to infinity for some X two  there 'll be a value of F X two greater than K

and because X cubed tends to minus infinity  uh there 'll be a value here  not necessarily minus such that K is greater than F X one

yeah 

Now  you see there K stuck between F is something F is something

a theorem should come to your mind like a flash of lightning 

What theorem were we doing

Remember we had

not only is this function  interm

Brilliant

OK

Remember

if it was F A  and F B and gamma stuck in the middle or C stuck in the middle right then you know there must must be a value

So that tells you three-or-four-words

There exists  an X such that F X equals A 

OK 

I mean another way of looking at that is that if you have a continuous function when you apply it to an interval  it goes to an interval  and since you can get things up here as big as you like  this thing has to be an interval

So that tells you then that X goes to X cubed is  one

it 's injective cos increasing 

It 's almost  essentially why you 're using the intermediate value theorem 

If you like all all that that 's saying is you could if you were innocent and you wanted to prove that you 'd say

well every particular number has a cubed root

and actually what we 've proved is the intermediate value theorem that tells you every number has a cubed root

 tells you that every number has a unique cube root

And the inverse of this function is going to be a cube root function 

Right

If I can get the cubes and you then you get back to cube roots 

OK

So now  we have an injective 

We have a bijective function

That ta shows you that K is 

Bijective is not too difficult

I mean all right you might not have got this  thing exactly right but you should have been able to do the rest

And so what what what why what was so difficult about it 

Intermediate value theorem

I never know how valid the answers are  

Yeah yeah

It 's very difficult isn't it

You know this is what you learn that there 's no you learn with practice 

You know you keep getting  things and you put too much in 

Don't put so many arguments in

and then you don't something in

Don't leave out the crucial stage

So there 's a sort of maturity here mathematical maturity

You 're putting in the right kind of argument and also not to have waffly arguments like saying

well it 's injective because it 's one

one which really is just saying the same thing

and you 've got to have a real functional argument to justify what what you 're doing

You know get down and really have a proper argument  based on the facts and theorems that you know 

Now what about what about the uh  the theory that it 's not differentiable

I now know what theorem minus three is about cos I asked Professor Larman what it was  and he said it 's the appropriate theorem for this for this result  which wasn't very helpful

You see it appears in in the question doesn't it 

So that was a quite good uh thing to to say

Right

Now  what i what is the result saying

Supposing we have  A goes to B  F

Supposing this is one one one two  and continuous 

We know F minus one exists

B to A exists 

What can you say about F minus one 

If I know F is continuous

right

what can I say about F minus one

Oh yes

Mmm

Oh it 's continuous

Right

So one theory is that if you have a function from interval A to interval B which is a bijection then the inverse function will be continuous

If this is continuous then the inverse function is continuous

Right 

Supposing this is differentiable 

So this 

Now if it 's differentiable  what can you say about F minus one

Well it 's differentiable as well

Differentiable 



F minus one is differentiable always

Only when it 's got a 

But when when when  will the derivative 

Right

So when you differentiate F minus one if you like can look at Y is equal to F X  and therefore you have X is equal to F to the minus one  Y

So you 're trying to find out  uhm trying to find out what that is what is D by D Y  of F to the minus one 

It 's equal to D X by D Y  and that is equal to  one over  F dash X 

OK 

But X is equal to F minus one equal to one over F dash  F minus one  Y

OK 

If you like  D Y D X of F minus one X  is one over F dash  of uh  minus one of X at that point 

OK

But the thing is  it doesn't work when that 's zero so you 're going to have the derivative not being zero at that particular point 

OK

And of course what happens here is the derivative at X equals nought 

F dash nought  is equal to zero and so you 've got a problem 

OK

So that 's evident

If you look If you look at theorem minus three it says it is differentiable provided the derivative of that point is non-zero 

Now did you look at the theorem minus three  or didn't you do

Only when it 's got 

Gap in my notes

Pardon

You 've got a gap in your notes

What about the rest of you who asked 

Yeah yeah but it was just you know like being sure that you had kind of like the right

Oh never mind a bit of insecurity 

 you should Listen you should be out on your own

You should be able to be adventurous and take your own sort of  uh things and make your own

You You 'll only learn how from your own mistakes

Uhm  now at this point I 'm going to  leave some more work to you 

Uhm now here we 've got The Harlot 's  Progress

There 's a plate 

And can you  uhm just point out some of the sort of satirical elements in this work what  elements of satire what ways of satirising

Again I 'm not really concerned so much with meaning but the ways in which the satire is  achieved 

Well all right

For a start we 've got the uh pile of pots and pans in that doorway on the left

Yes

What do What do they signify

Well that 's the fall of the girl presumably from  well not from grace perhaps but you know from

Well uhm  yes

I mean it it it it 

Everything 's topsy-turvy in the 

Yes 

Could suggest loss of virginity couldn't it because I mean often broken pots 

Uhm something 's about to be broken

It 's not quite

It 's in the process of being broken

She At this precise moment she 's being taken in hand by a notorious bawd

So that could be what it it 's uh 

Uh but it does suggest perhaps impending disaster to   

Some of the clergymen mirror what 's the corruption that 's going on between the girl and the bawd Y

Yes

I mean yes there is a sense in which she is a sort of fa&ccedille;ade and then behind her is what 's really going on

In other words she is being a nice grandmotherly soul to this innocent country girl

but behind her is the notorious uhm  uh Colonel Charteris who was again supposed to have used prostitutes to procure innocent young virgins for him to seduce and then turn into prostitutes 

Uhm so that 's uh so that 's so in a sense there is a kind of special strategy there isn't there of actually sort of making a foreground and a background as part of the point 

Anything else 

Yes

Does this bell there chequers mean anything

Yes

Well I don't know

Chequers the bell yes

What does the bell mean 

Mm

Uhm 

Well then could it be to ring out a warning

Well uh yes yes

I mean I don't uh uh

Yes

But I mean it 's one of the things that you get so often in these uh caricatures

After all one of the things it 's easy to forget that in the early eighteenth century indeed all the way upt within living memory that people actually knew the Bible very well and that they automatically when seeing a bell would think of  bells 

Uhm and you find that uh i in all sorts of ways that that certain assumptions are made

Not Not always

Uhm and indeed some scholars have actually exaggerated it enormously and seen this as for instance a kind of uhm s satire on the Visitation of the Virgin and and seen the whole thing in terms of Biblical analogies 

Uh that seems to me far fetched

But the the potential is there certainly 

Uhm and often where you 've got uh inscriptions below it it sometimes signals Biblical parallel 

In in In The Rake 's Progress for instance you 've got a commentary underneath the the the series  which is written by a vicar 

And he actually signals Biblical parallels

And  it 's one of the ways in which uhm analogies are made so often in satire in the eighteenth century 

Either with perhaps a classical parallel

that 's a parallel taken from an old master painting or from the Bible 

You look puzzled

A bit

No

 

Obviously not

Uhm  again the the the the difficulty with interpretation of course of these things is that visual uhm signifiers as it were don't always uhm you can't always see what in fact they 're signifying

And you might see uh this on the one hand is  possibly meant to suggest uh the universal fate of mankind

but we do also know that coaches came in from Berlin as well 

Uhm

and one of the problems with the sort of naturalistic mode of Hogarth 's uhm  modern moral subjects like this is that you don't you can't guess for certain the the the you know the these signifier these natural signifiers that aren't actually uhm simply what they claim to be 

So they signal uhm signifies

On the one hand the Bell Inn

That 's clear enough uhm

But could it also signify uhm uh they 're in or whatever

Uhm  yes

What other modes of satire do you see 

Right

Uhm the characterisation of the  forget her name now the old bawd

The way she 's sort of

Yes yes

Mother Eden

Yes

Yeah

The way she 's really poxy underneath

Yes

She 's sort of poxy but very well dressed

Yes  yes  yes

Which again uh could have a number of possible  uh  meanings

It could mean uhm simply identify her as a an old bawd as a danger

But it could also suggest the dangers of of what may lurk behind fine clothes as well

So a kind of moralising point 

Uhm just as Colonel Charteris is a man of military rank and yet a a wanton seducer  uhm so she

And she was notorious Mother Megan for dressing up in Sunday best  at all times

And of course it 's not a Sunday generally 

Yeah

Mm

What does this goose mean down here

Yes

I was wondering about that

Well uh all right

Well there we are

What does it mean 

Addressed to her loafing cousin

her loafing cousin 

Uhm

And a lot of people say that it 's deliberately misspelt I don't know to suggest her ignorance or innocence as she 's come from a very remote part of the country

She 's come from York  on the York stage  which is  no small distance in the eighteenth century 

Uhm  but there is a possibility that it could also symbolize that she 's a goose a sort of silly goose  

Was it alive do you think when she set out for the country was it

Was it meant to be dead

I 'm sorry

Oh I see yes

I mean I 'd ra I would imagine that that 's what people from the country would bring to cousins in the city wouldn't you think a a a nice fat goose

It wouldn't be It wouldn't be a

It wouldn't be a live goose though

Oh I see

No

Probably not

No 

Uhm it may also of course

The other thing is that you 've sometimes these may refer to common expressions like silly goose or word or  something like that

It 's possible

She 's a silly goose 

Uhm  and you can see that that again the problem with the the kind of attempted naturalism of of these things is you know how far are you meant to go uhm in the interpretation

And And one of the you know principal arguments   of Ronald Olson who uhm  who works really on the sort of principle that anything you can throw in is plausible and you can make a great deal of the irony of the visitation

He sees the whole thing series in terms of Biblical analogies and some of them are quite preposterous I think 

Uhm  yes

Any other satirical satiric strategies here



Is that what the uh the young girl is going to become 

Mm

Well that that that 's an an an interesting idea

Yes

three-or-four-words

Cos she 's hanging out looking word word

Yeah

I don't know

Uhm  it 's possible  certainly possible

Uh I think again the uh that 's a very interesting point that Philip 's made

you see that that quite often uh particularly in in

I mean there is a narrative sense in these modern world subjects which means that you can that often uhm  the future is signified in some way or another 

or past 

In this case that could intimate the future of this word girl

Yeah

Good 

But of course in a narrative series the the question of time is very important 

But again I haven't got I don't really want to go into that at this stage

I just wanted to establish that there are ways of analysing

And And of course there again the other form that 's worth looking at is is is sort of typecasting if you like

Uhm this is the country vicar seeking preferment

And he 's got a uhm a letter of introduction to the Bishop of London

And he wants to find the Bishop of London uhm to ask him for a resident benefice and

and in the meantime he 's totally neglectful of  the fate of of   but also all the other goals in the uhm  Church

So it 's like a sort of if you imagine in present day terms going to sort of King 's Cross with all these  coming off  the train    to Scotland and then uhm and then uh the vicar totally ignoring the sort of moral danger they 're in

And that 's the equivalent in today 's terms 

So quite a lot of different sorts of strategies at work here 

Now in a way the uhm uh  one thing that I think is quite clear about that one is is that it 's that the target is in some sense uhm  uh uh sort of of the mortal danger of of  uhm  sexual license or or whatever

But there is there are other possible targets as well

And there is a sense in which and Hogarth I think realised this that satire is also a form of entertainment

Uhm  I wanted to show you the uh one of the actresses dressing in the barn

Now what do you think is actually being satirised here would you say 

Sorry

What did you say this was

It 's called Actresses Dressing in a Barn

Thank you 

What 's actually going on

What is one observing here 

There 's this fop on the left who 's been trying to seduce 

Uh yes

I mean  possibly

But what are what are all the people here

what are they all doing

What 've they all got in common 

Every single person  except one  

What are they all doing 

Well I mean they 're all acting aren't they

I mean they 're all uh

And so the the the joke is that you 're seeing uh this  uh figure of Diana uhm just at the point where she 's putting her shift on 

And you 've got there Juno sort of declaiming her lines

And I think in many ways that the main

And there are a couple of uhm whatever they are putti or whatever uhm cupids uhm who are  drinking beer on top of a cardboard altar or something made of similarly flimsy stuff

And I think one of the wittiest bits really is the figure of evil there who turns out to be  a woman you see inside there

and she 's feeding a baby   

So uhm 

And then

yes of course this is a some sort of love scene going on

but you notice she 's got a sort of mermaid 's tail as well 

uhm  and then there is uhm an angel or a cupid probably going up the ladder to see if his socks are dry uhm

and so on and so on

I mean you can just go on and on

And then down below you 've got some kittens who are playing with those props  uhm including an orb 

Uhm and there are also crowns and bishops ' mitres and all sort of things down there 

So what 's being satirised 

The acting profession as a whole 

Well uhm 

Well is it the kind of plays they put on then

Well yes The the

They

Well no no

I mean we know what the play is

It 's called uhm  uh it 's called The Devil to Pay in Heaven or something

And it is certainly satirical of a play by Fielding or somebody at that time

Popular play you know 

And then here we see the larger sort of themes

One over here 

Is it about religion the fact that they can play act act at being you know religious or whatever including big word props

Well I think that 's that makes it sound a bit more puritanical

It 's certainly an attack on on sort of vanity isn't it and and artifice isn't it

I mean the contrast is everywhere being made even in the shirts hanging on a line and

and th th the fact they 're in this leaky barn with a peeping tom uhm is the the contrast between the pretensions of uhm the sort of these people who are acting as gods on Parnassus

and yet at the same time they are confined to this miserable country barn

Uhm

So it 's it 's a if you like a meditation  on on sort of pretence and vanity

So we might as well start by   anything in particular that you 'd like to discuss 

Do you think these tutorials are a waste of time 

The class seems to be voting with its feet

I think the tutorials are helpful

Can we have some like next term near the exam time

because at the moment we 've all got like so much work to do I haven't had time to like go through the lecture notes and things

I couldn't actually tell you What I 'm stuck on at the moment cos I 've got like  my project that I have to hand in  and you know all  all  all the assessments

Yeah that would be

I I 'm afraid I don't think it is going to be possible unfortunately

but I think it 's something that we 'll have to bear in mind for future years that  if if the tutorials during the course are not

Quite frankly it 's just not really worth our while running them for four people so that you know unless we can find an arrangement the whole class  finds useful then 

You know

On the one hand students  find lectures rather boring and intimidating

and yet given an opportunity to come to a more informal tutorial they they don't bother to come

So we 're sort of caught in a a trap

Yeah 

Uhm but I take your point and we can

You know I think it 's not going to be possible actually to to do that next term unfortunately

Yeah

Yeah

But I mean if I if I need some help could I still come

Yeah but I don't think there 'll be formal tutorials

You can ask specific questions on occasions but you know unfortunately we 've got major commitments  and now 's the opportunity we 've allocated to deal with that 

OK

well anyway I mean you four are the people who 've come

so you deserve the the reward for your diligence

So let 's let 's take the opportunity to discuss our  the lectures which I 've given you recently which are dealing with the special senses

Is there any specific problem related to them or is the subject matter clear 

From time to time

Mm



The primary in that sense means the first relay neuron which lies in the periphery 

So in the case of the  sensory system which deals with the sensation from the whole body the primary neuron the central neuron is the neuron that aligns with itself in the dorsary ganglia and whose axons make up peripheral nerves and dorsal roots

OK

So that 's a primary sensory neuron

And the same with the auditory pathway

The primary auditory neuron is the neuron  the spinal membrane and whose peripheral axon goes to the hair cells

And the central axon makes up the cochleal nerve 

So that it 's the first sensory neuron in the system that makes the primary neuron

Secondary pathways are the pathways that then run from the next neuron along 

So they

These

And the secondary pathways are all within the central nervous system

They 're not  the system 

Anything else

Any other specifics 

Have you done the before the structure of the eye

have you covered that in any other course

Right



You have done that



And that was covered in what kind of detail



All right

Did you

And so in a sense I 'm asking you

I mean have you you 've never you haven't come across the structure of the eye before

Yeah I have

You have

So that you 're happy

Yeah

Can you go again through all the different layers through the  eye

I

In this giant cortex it 's simple complex hypercomplex

Is that right

Right

And then  in the retina

That 's where you have all your  ganglion bipolar whatever

But which order do they come in 

What connects to what and

The two the two the two are not unrelated

You shouldn't confuse the cortex with the retina I think

Yeah

You know they have quite separate functions

But what 's like the hierarchical arrangement of the cells

I mean is it like bipolar joins on to horizontal to

You know what I mean

I I know what cells

OK well don't mix up the retina with the  cortex tha tha

That 's quite different

Well does anybody know what is the  the

If If a photon of light hits the retina what c what cells does it act on

Yeah



Right

It acts on the photoreceptors

So what is the nex

In a sense you 're asking what is the next stage

But doesn't it have to go through all the other cells first because of the arrangement

Well that 's

Yeah

Well that just happens to be

That doesn't matter

It 's not passing on information

It 's just It just so happens that these cells are transparent so that photons can go through them but it 's not  changing those cells or acting on them

It 's the same way with light coming through a through a pane of glass

You don't say that the glass was changed by the light

It 's only the photoreceptors that detect the light

So the fact that they are piled on top of the photoreceptors is irrelevant cos they as far as the light is concerned they they 're not there

That 's what transparent means

It goes through

The light The photon travels through without being either absorbed or reflected 

Yeah

But I mean why

What 's the point of that arrangement

Is it just

Well ask evolution

You know that 's

What 's

The point is there was some advantage during evolution  to to create the

Well try and think about it

Why do you think we needed

The arrangement is The anatomical arrangement as opposed to the flow of information is that on the the innermost surface of the retina you 've got the axons of the ganglion cells

Then you 've got ganglion cells

Then you 've got the relay neurons which are the bipolar cells and the horizontal  cells and then you 've got the photoreceptors and then you 've got a layer of what 

It 's the innermost layer of the retina

Sorry the outermost layer of the retina

Yeah

Is that pigment

Yeah pigment 

So what possible functional advantage can you have from the fact that light has to travel through a row of at least three cells to get to the photoreceptors  given the information I 've given you 

Well it 's the fact that the photoreceptors are immediately adjacent to the pigment  and  it prevents the light being reflected or and it abs absorbs

The light is either acts on the on the photoreceptors or disappears effectively from the retina

That 's what the pigment does

It absorbs the light and that 's why it 's black 

So that it 's like in a camera

You need to get a a good sharp image

The light must not be scattered or reflected in in any way 

So it just improves the image if you have a black surface on which the photo-sensitive elements ar arrive

and the only way it could then arrange it if if you 're going to have processing of the cells is to have the processing cells on top provided they are transparent

In other words as far as the light is concerned they aren't there

Makes no difference so it 's no problem 

So wha what do like

I know you said

they 're all processing cells

But what do they do they actually do individually 

Well when  photon interacts with the photoreceptor it changes the the ionic count in that photoreceptor 

And the cell as we discussed does the opposite of all other sensory neurons and hyperpolarises instead of bipolarising  and that information is transferred to bipolar cells 

And those bipolar cells transfer that information to ganglion cells 

and the ganglion cells are affected by groups of photoreceptors via the horizontal and cells which transfer information horizontally

So you 've got both vertical transfer of information from photoreceptors to the ganglion cells and horizontal direction of information transfer across the the retina

In the end that means that your ganglion cell has a receptive field

and you know what a receptive field now is

It 's that area of the visual field where if it 's activated the ganglion cell will fire

And ganglion cells have what kind of receptor fields

Do you remember

Spiral

Yes

You have a concentric on-off cell so that you can have either have the centre of the field on

In other words when the light is shone in that on field the cell will fire a series of action potential  with an off surround so that if  the cell will be inhibited 

We can have the reverse where it 's an on surround or an off centre and that receptive field is created by bipolar cells and horizontal and cells acting on on ganglion cells

You don't have a single photoreceptor going to a single bipolar cell going to a single uhm a single photoreceptor a single bipolar cell a single ganglion

If you had that you wouldn't have these receptor fields would you

Receptor fields are constructed from many  cells but the information is transferred and processed and converges on the ganglion cells through these bipolar horizontal cells

which  horizontal cells

Uhm from ganglion cells

Is that from where you get the optic nerve

Right

The ganglion cells give off axons which then flow out over the surface the inner surface of the retina and may then leave the retina through what

Remember

What part of the retina

Optic 

Well the optic  is where they leave the orbits

but the actual nerve fibres to make up the optic nerve where do they leave the retina

At the fovea



No 

Fovea 's the exact opposite

The fovea 's the most densely uh innervated part of  the most dense collection of cones

So it 's the blind spot or optic disc

Structurally it 's the optic disc

Functionally it 's the blind spot  because it 's blind in the sense that if you  you can map out if if if I mapped out your your visual field as a small little object carefully mapping out there is a  point  there 's a point in your receptor field but you will not see that object that small object

You will become blind 

There 's a part of our each of us has a recep part of our visual field where there 's a hole and we don't see anything

and that 's the blind spot

and that is anatomically the place where the optic disk lies 

OK

Can you explain about these uhm  columns in the uhm   cortex

Right

We can get to it in a moment

Lets Let 's just go through  the pathway just to make sure you 're happy with that

Are you

So tha that 's the basic arrangement of the retina

and then you 've got the optic nerve 

and it 's

Wha What happens to the optic nerve when it it leaves uh enters the cranial cavity 

You get decussation of the nasal uhm  field

Oh I don't

the optic track on the nasal side of both eyes

Right  it 's not the nasal

You must be very careful with that cos otherwise you 're going to get confused

It 's not the nasal field  that decussates

It 's the nasal retina that that decussates

So it 's the fibres on the nasal retina

What part of the visual field does the nasal retina serve



The lateral or temporal field

You see one mustn't confuse the retina and the field

They are opposite because the lens  turns the light upside down

If you look in a camera with a lens what happens to the image

It 's turned upside down and back to front

That 's exactly what happens in our eyes and that 's why the nasal retina actually sees light  from the lateral field

So what I see when I see my hand over here that is hitting my nasal retina over on this side over there

Last last week when we were in cognitive psychology and stuff things got a li just a little bit tutorialish  me doing much of the speaking 

So uh this week

and what I 'd like people to do is uh give brief  summaries to the group about the contents of their essays

Now three of them I only got this morning so I haven't had time to look at  uhm but I still might ask someone to do them

To give people some forewarning uh Matt who did nature versus nurture generally could maybe start things off

Now when we s These are just people

I just want them to  summarize the contents of their essay so I could just start looking through it now

I don't want them to sort of just read it out in fact tell people 

The The uh summary should be made to the to the rest of the group

and people on the basis of the voluminous reading which I know you 've all done are invited to uh ask the speaker questions

They probably might be to me in fact

It 's not up to me to sort of regulate what people say or what questions they 've got or anything 

Uh  Colin covered

I would like to get a a balance of all the subjects

Colin was the  the only person who did anything of a cognitive nature and did language acquisition so Colin  can  summarize that after Matt 

Uh we need something more biological

I 've got  uh it 's Esther yeah uh essay on uh well on homosexuality though I suggest it might be better thought of as on sexuality more generally uhm 

Uh or  you could have depressive illness  or schizophrenia I think 

Any votes for any of these  what people would like to discuss

Sexuality I think

We 've got one vote for sexuality

Anyone have  any other preferences 

I hear

You 're obviously all galvanised by you your uh study and desperately wanting to talk about these things  uh 

OK well given that there was one vote we will have uh  Esther can tell us all about sexuality uh later 

And then maybe uh  we 'll see how the time goes

Uh couple of things we need t to uh consider  in this that the people want to  

Uh one is  what just what are these influences

If s If you say something is influenced by nature what is it  how does it work  and  how can we test it

This is always a question in psychology for any area

Whatever problem comes up you always have this issue in experimental psychology of how we test it

If people can just make random assertions about some issue that you can just not possibly go out and do doing testing on it

It just isn't it 's philosophy or something

I don't know

but it just it doesn't become psychology until we can sort of do something about it

otherwise if people just say what they want there 's no way of telling what it 's like

and so so what you know it 's considered largely a waste of well not a waste of time

it 's just that  perfectly balanced way of spending your time 

Somebody for nurture

What do we mean by uh  the environment of some kind

Most people in their essays say

well environmental influences

and this is the way people thought typically in uh well the past in texts and so forth

People just talk  about the environment as though it 's obvious

precisely what it is  would just be the sum total of everything that surrounds the individual

So clearly does everything affect people

or is there some selection process by which the organism selectively responds 

Uhm again how do we test uh 

Can we test these things 

Someone says uh  to uh  social conditioning

so girls are told to wear dresses wear clothes and so forth

and that 's what turns them into  women

How do we

I mean maybe it 's not true

but how do we try and find out

find out 

Well that 's an issue which is a crucial one

Is the  interaction in practically every case you get some interaction even when you when you can't test these things

When you do test them you never get  you never seem to fi find for psychological traits or at least that it 's either a hundred per cent correlated with genetics or it 's it 's highly uncorrelated cos you always seem to get some sort of mixture

And if there is a mixture uh  how does it happen 

Uh this relates to  uh something we touched on last week when we were talking about the relationship between cognitive explanations 

someone does something because they believe so and so such and such  and physiological uh measures

If I say that uh  uh someone 's someone 's heart rate is rapidly increasing because they believe they 're going to die  you have on the one hand the physical observation increase in heart rate on the other hand the inscription the belief

they believe they 're going to die

We have a problem in psychology in terms of how these two things can link up

Belief isn't does not say about a physical state  of the system so we want to know how come beliefs can change heart rates 

Well  in this area we have the same problem

Nature is  is really just about genetics  about transmission of genes from parents to the offspring and genes just they recode for  things like proteins all descriptions on the genetic level known to be in terms largely of biochemistry 

On one level the language of genetics is biochemistry 

Language of the environment seems to say things  that 've got nothing to do with biochemistry 

It says such and such a  these things just are not about biochemistry

If if the two are to interact how can these two languages  interact

Oh but they can't really

so by what means are we going to link them up if we if we are going to say that they there is a  uh interaction 

Basically it 's the same problem with  biological levels of explanation for ordinary behaviour

Can't we link them

And you have the same issue for environment and genetics OK

So these are the sort of things that uh  you  might be thinking about

I mean you can think anything else you want

but these are sort of the central

or at least I I assume it is the central issue 

So uh Matt did you uh  did you explain uhm

Uhm right 

To start with then you 've got to decide what the environment and what uh what nature and what nurture is 

Uhm nature basically means your genetics your hereditary what is passed down to you from your parents

Now this is your chromosomes and your genes

Now this within your genes is the information to uhm  to tell cells in your body what to do

Now basically what each gene does is tell a cell to build certain protein 

Uhm that then makes the cell function in a certain way and all the cells in your body then need to work together to make you do certain things

Now uhm  genes in your body will all work together to produce certain physical characteristics if it  such as your height your weight your hair colour your eye colour

All of these things are uhm  genetically sort of decided when you 're born

That 's a fact

It 's years of study and it 's obvious that someone is born and they have to develop into a certain height because of their genes coded into certain proteins in their body

That 's enough 

Yeah 

So nothing that could happen to them during their life

Well basically you 're born with genes which say you 're going to be small or big yeah 

Is everyone agreed

I mean fine if you don't

It depends as well if don't have enough food or  as you grow so 

but the environment  depends what situation you 're put in

Well

Yeah but

But surely it means 

Yeah but your genes still say you 're going to be small or big

If you then have like if you 've got plenty of food you then grow to be big  if you 've got the genes

Hang on

say you got a gene which say you 're going to have good bone structure you 're going to have good muscles and you 're going to grow to be big

You then have a lot of food

you 're going grow to be big

You then don't have a lot of food you 're you 're not going to be as big as you would have been  but you 'd still be bigger than someone who had small genes and didn't have a lot of food d' you understand

It 's interaction to set right across

I was just saying what genes were first of all

Mmm

Oh right

Uh don't worry about the people interrupting you 

You 're gonna have to  sort of thing

Uhm right OK nurturing is what happens to you from your environment your uhm 

First of all you 've got to say what your environment is 

Environment is everything that happens to you which you sense happening to you as you grow up through life

All the things which occur around you and you sense through your eyes your ears your feeling

All of these things are your environment and they interact with your genes to uh affect the way in which you develop 

Right so that 's what nature and nurture is

Now we can look through history at what people have thought which is the most important in how peo people will develop 

Uhm  until the seventeenth century most people sort of believed that uhm  adults  humans were born into the world as miniature adults  that everything was due to the hereditary

They would be born in a certain way and whatever happened with their life they 'd grow up in the same way

Nothing that happened would change how they were going to turn out 

That was until this bloke came along called uhm John Locke

Are you sure about this that this is what everyone thought as well

Yeah it was the sort of generally held thing that everyone came into the world just

 I mean your source for that uhm 

Well no 

Anyway so we 've got

Does everybody else know that

Yeah

I mean uh uh where would you where would

how would you try and verify this uh assertion that uh

Well through what people who have written during the seventeenth century they have sort of said before John Locke came along uhm  they believed that humans were born into the world and then grew up

Whatever happened in affects the way they grew up

When when did Locke uh  write

Some time in the seventeenth century

D' you mean the seventeen hundreds 

No  

I think it was the I think it was the seventeen hundreds

Was it eighteenth century  perhaps the seventeenth century 

The seventeenth century

It was seventeenth century 

But before then I mean  you 're saying that before then  everyone thought that  it was genetics

Well not everyone

No I didn't say it was genetics

Also they didn't know what genetics was

They thought that it was that people were just born in a certain way and grew up  and that their environment played no influence in how 

 the stars or

All right

That doesn't count uhm 

The the idea that that there was this that the people everyone then was some sort of genetic degenerate

Not everyone but generally hel

All right all right

It was a generally held opinion that people were born into the world  and the way they developed was then already sort of set

Whatever happened after they were born had no influence on the way in which they developed

So you don't believe in an absolute fate in themselves in the 

Uhm well not fate in the way that sort of what happens to them but the way they developed into that type of person their physical characteristics

I think it 's all 

Let 's say uhm that the support for this view found in the works of William Shakespeare perhaps a line where William Shakespeare agrees 

Uhm there 's a I think there 's a line in Julius Caesar regarding the faults

I can't remember who he was talking to

OK

Are we ready

are we ready to start now 

Right

What I 'd like to do this afternoon is to  have one of our interpretation sessions similar to the earlier ones that we 've had uhm looking at correspondence analysis that we 've not yet looked at 

Uhm I 've got two two handouts 

This one that we 'll need first 

And then the the other one  is that one 

And the first one comes from Winchester  and it 's all published  and you can easily read about it later

Uhm that 's that 's the article 

It 's in Object and Economy in Medieval Winchester  which I don't suggest you buy as it costs about two hundred pounds 

but I think the library 's got it

and then  if anyone wants to photocopy that they 're welcome to photocopy the whole article 

We 'll just be looking at one small aspect 

So what I 'll do  is explain  the  the handout what the various bits of it are  and then leave you to work together in twos or threes whatever you think 's appropriate twos I should think  to see what you can make of it very briefly

And then we 'll come back and talk about ha how how we actually interpret  these results 

I 'm reasonably confident of that one

I mean I think I know what 's going on

Put it that way

Which one

The the Winchester one 

The other one I 'm much less confident about 

The other one is Portchester Castle

It 's a Roman site  and that 's much more of a problem  and that is in some respects still an unresolved issue  so you may need to have something which will  help 

 you need a couple of handouts

Yeah

That is the other one

I 've still got some

Which is that one



We 're doing this one first 

That 's it

OK

Right

Right 

The dat The data that I got from the Winchester unit  consisted of large numbers of accounts diff different types different types of finds  that were found in different types of site and were found in context of different dates

So it 's a three word word

We 've got type of find  we got date and we got type of site 

But we 're only going to be looking at one aspect of that which is the date and type of find

We 're not looking at the type of site although that is in my view important 

And in  the data actually came in the form of stretchy data

It was was a strange computer known as a Sinclair Q L  and  I don't know if anyone remembers them

They ran on microtapes

Mhm

And they were dangerous on the road too  

So to to fill you in the first the first page gives you the names of the various  dates and then the names of the various types of artefact  and the date itself on the right hand side 

So you 've got there the dates up the tenth century eleventh century and so on down to sixth seventeenth century plus  meaning seventeenth century and anything later than that 

Then U S unstratified  artefacts which couldn't be assigned in dating context

All these are the dates of the context in which the artefact was found not the date that they think the artefact belongs to 

And they correspond to the columns of the data on the right-hand side  and you 'll see there 's a full data set at the top and then a reduced data set at the bottom  and

Now hang on

Yeah

Mm

Eh

So those are the column headings

Those are the column headings about the tenth century eleventh century and so on



Ah 

Right

OK

OK

Yeah

Right 

And you 'll see that half way down it  shifts and there 's one there 's one column narrower 

Yeah

And that 's because  the final column which is the unstratified stuff that 's been pruned off 

Mm

No

uh





Uhm

Oh

Those are column headings



So what 's the one two one O four two which don't seem to be against the Up To Tenth Century

The one two 

The top the top

The row the rows relate to the artefact types so that one two one O four two relates to beads

They 're not opposite each other

I just printed them out and photocopied them

Eh

Ea Each row of the table is an artefact type and each column is a century 

In the order in which they occur here right

In the order in which they come on this

Right

Oh

Gawd

Yeah 

Eh













Eh

Oh

Eh



I dunno don't know

Eh

But there aren't enough columns in that because there 's more 

Oh

Up to the tenth century is this

Sorry

because







Yes

He

That 's all right

Yeah

But then





And then once 

Yes the 



Mm

Mm

Aren't you clever 

The next one is Doctor word

Can we begin 

You notice that halfway down this trail of data there 's a line I 've drawn 

OK 

And you 'll note that it 's narrow

Now that is the reduced data set

I 'll explain later why it was reduced 

I took out I took out some of the rows  and I took out the last column  and the  another set of names which are just a shortened list of the first list 

And those are the types of artefact that actually appear in this reduced data set

So I took out some of the types that were causing trouble 

Yeah

Mhm

You took out beads 

Right 

Yes

Mm mm

So that that 's the first page

What 's the little note on the right that says finds X date datable

Finds times date

These These are the final  that you can find on the computer

There 's a there 's a directory called finds times date  and then within that there 's a final reduced  

And the other one is finds by date by full

Mm

What 's full

Four

Full

F U double L

Oh 

There 's a full data set and a reduced data set

Right 

If you turn over the page you get a pair of facing pages  which are to file find by date  results full

And that 's the correspondence analysis of the full data set 

You get thirty-one times nine periods 

And then if you go over that again  you 've then got find by date results reduced which is  another pair of facing pages  

So that 's another analysis but on a reduced data scale

Eh 

Why

Oh

Is there anything else

It says principle  

OK

Yeah

Yeah fine

And to clarify that

I 've got another nasty little graph that I drew in a hurry  which plots out the  

Yeah 

Well I thought it was better than getting you lot to plot it out anyway 

Cor

Yeah 

But then we 've got to try and read it 



Well you can always plot your own  drafts

You know 

But that that that is the plot that goes with the second of the two analyses  no the first of the two analyses

Sorry

I 've only mentioned the first of the analyses

Hm

Mm





Now before you  uhm  break into groups and look at the results of the two analyses and try and see what 's going on  any any any sort of questions of clarification about what you 've actually been presented with  so that you really do know what you 're doing

Yes

Yeah

What 's it mean



Oh

You give the abbreviations at the heads of columns P E R C 

Where 's this  



I I know

Yeah per cent

Per cent

Oh

You know you 've got the colum they 're comp

First table principal axis inertia per cent cumulative per cent and a histogram 

So if I just draw this out 



All right

Yes 

Simple

And then on the second table you 've got quality  mass  inertia



Yes

That 's noted on the back 

That 's noted on the back

Mhm

Yes

That 's right

Oh there 's a note at the bottom too

Oh yes 

You have

There 's a note at the bottom

Oh

what is it that inertia stands for  

I mean uh wha what 's inertia in this context

Describes a pupil

In this context inertia is  is a combination of how much data we 've got and then how and how far away it is from the average

Describes a 

Oh

Oh 

I see

It 's it 's the  for the two

uh you did do that but it 's quite some time ago now

I 'll just look it up





Well it 's one times the other

It 's is is it 's the mass times some measure of the distant angle from the centre of the thing 

centre of the block 

So that something where the inertia is a lot higher than the mass which is something about freedom in distribution and something where the inertia is a lot is lower lower than the mass which is something which is a very average 

Mm 

Could you could you give the definition again so that I can write it down

Definition of inertia

Yes

About it

Y you said how much data plus

Now it 's 

It 's mass times the distance from the centre if one 's being pedantic about it 

Mhm 

Times 







It 's called inertia by analogy with uhm mechanics  where you have the inertia  of a spinning object for example 

And  it it

I can remember going

In in the Science Museum there always used to be a machine where you had a had a whip and you turned it and there was a top to whip by hand

There 'd be a weight at each end 

And there are two of these one steel weights and one with aluminium weights 

And you turned it

And the steel weight it was very difficult to get it turning because the inertia was high and it 's a lot of work to get it turning

Once you do get it turning then you couldn't stop it  because the inertia with a heavy steel weight finds the distance it was from  wheel

The aluminium one was much easier because it had much less inertia because although it was just as far out the weight was less 

But you could have had a steel one further in nearer the middle with the same inertia as the much lighter aluminium one further out



Mm 

Ah  

But it 's 

But the way to look at it is if you compare mass with inertia inertia being a lot bigger mass things like A two

Inertia inertia mass gets very tacky sort of thing  right in the middle 

I think that there 's one here

Let me see

Mm

Mm

I was just thinking about art because I was going to get back to painting after not doing any for a year and a half 

So I was quite interested in the idea of what you could use instead of canvas and how uh you could use the thing that you paint on to be part of an environment or affected by the environment it was in 

Because I 've been uh 

I was going down to the Tate taking photographs of things that I couldn't buy postcards of like Sutherland 's Crucifixion 

You had all these reflections in the picture and the picture is very much affected by its environment

The fluorescent lighting was cutting across the uh  crucified figure you know and uh disturbing the picture in some way

Mm

The glass over it

Yeah yeah

Mhm

And so I really

What I wanted to do was

the painting like was actually affected by its environment

so if it was hanging on an a white gallery wall then that would actually affect the painting

And if it was hanging on a piece of wallpaper that would actually affect the picture

The picture is part of environment that it 's actually in 

So I decided to not use anything like glass because of the reflective value of it  and that that might interfere with the painting so I decided to use something that was  non-reflective and that would allow the light to filter through 

So I used this uh mesh which is used for theatre design  called uhm  which is used for being painted on and uh being fronted back again to uh change the volume of in the painting 

So in the painting like say the black one cos that 's the only one real one that 's been really been uh pushed anywhere yet

But the black one is uh

it looks sturdy in idea

and uh the thing about that is that  it 's still using natural light

the different uh

When it 's on this wall it 's just a solid because of the way it all works 

it changes to a transparent if you 're in the light 

so it 's just actually in uh

it 's using natural light of day 

and then full of meaning the actual picture will change according to the light level  rather than the painting having its own kind of uh sense of light

In the painting say of  who painted the uh Mediterranean sun I mean the paint has no sense of light of its own really 

Its light comes from natural light 

That 's what illuminates it at the end of the day 

So it looks different in a Mediterranean light than it would in uh an industrial tungsten light 

And it doesn't have a light source of its own 

But I mean all the it 's just something to playing about with the idea of the canvas 

There 's no there 's no uh great message here yet because all I 'm worried about is colour and shape and uh testing that out on this fabric 

Not really worried about making a great statement 

Yeah

Just seeing them I mean

if I saw them somewhere without you know talking about them I mean I think I 'd think they were very much about uh sort of searching and  depths really  and  particularly the red one lots of uh suggestions of depth 

It 's almost like looking into water somehow uhm  and as you say it would vary enormously on what you put it

Mm

Yeah

Exactly

But at the end of the day there 's no uh 

The real space is the space between that gauze what 's that 's got the paint on it and the wall and that 's the space that 'll affect it at the end of the day 

Mmm 

And so 

I mean do you are you making this work into a position of detachment

In other words you make it and  in a way you wouldn't maybe care where it went

No no that 's the whole point of it yeah

Yeah

So if somebody 's uhm depending on what their wallpaper is or there wherever it goes that could even make or kill the picture

Indeed

I mean seeing the uhm writing on the wall there relating to the  scribbling on the picture  

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah when I was hanging downstairs when I was painting it just had sort of yellow and pink paint behind it

and so it 's just completely different wherever it moves

Yeah 

So rather more than being anything as I was reading it uhm about the spatial  it 's actually much more like context

Mm 

I was interested in the fact that you could uh the only real space that you could you could perhaps make something there with paint

and there was no kind of painting space that you was were trying to get in it

but the only space you could get in the picture would be physical space 

and that 's what would give it the sense of space you know  rather than using any kind of spatial contraptions or anything in your painting 

You still uh use the sort of shapes that you 've still drawn on the material

Yeah

The material by itself has quite a lot of space that you draw on



Ah because of the  stretcher makes an edge

Yeah I mean it 's there 's on the border there 's a space there where the light 's going through the different materials which I quite like

and in particular the bright background colour that comes through 

That 's why I like the idea of painting on a stretcher and having the stretcher you know be seen cos then it gives you a sense of its construction

But also you know there 's a lot of paintings you know

a lot happens at the edges of paintings doesn't it  and in a way that 's taken away from you isn't it here

Mhm

Mmm

I like the idea that you know you all the time you have that continual uh rectangle  in the picture so your rectangle could al would always be in it

So that 's why I 've been painting geometric shapes things that either set off or uhm kind of associate themselves with the rectangle that 's going all around the edge 

I think without the  uh the sort of scribbling or the shapes that you 've added there 's a very strong sense of  in it

Yeah I  quite a bit

Mmm

That sort of uhm physical look to it 

Do you think you need the sort of uhm  the scribbling or

No no no 

No they 're just uh no really it is just it 's just getting back into painting at the end of the day 

Mhm

Mhm

Do you think you need the gauze

Yeah  definitely need the gauze  but not necessarily need the marks that 've been made on the gauze at the moment  

That 's the question uh I 'm thinking about now

It 's not well whether to paint on this thing but actually what to paint on it and what the marks are going to be

Yeah

Mm 

I wasn't sure to what extent particularly on the black one to what extent the the the shape made in the middle or the scribbling were just sort of uhm  oh I don't know anti-art gestures really and a rather aesthetic  uh position you made for yourself there 

I mean if one uhm an attempt to vulgarise it by being you know what could be a rather quite a serious sort of  scene as if one wanted to see  something like that

Cos the little one I feel your  seems to me again to be poised between I suppose aesthetics on the one hand

but the imagery often is just 

Yeah that 's the thing about that black one

I was thinking today it looks like something from a Habitat house 

Looks kind of too chic doesn't it 

Yeah

Mhm

What the red one

No the black one 

What do you think of them Chris 

 

Well they 're not  well they may be a hundred miles from your work but they 're not a thousand miles from your work

It just doesn't   

Trying to do something with  with the objective  

I think the object stands

I think it 's like a a language that we build with

and I find it uhm  around a bit because of the nature of uhm

Could be a  storm in a teacup

I dunno don't know

Mmm

Well let 's talk about

 cos I think it may be that we 'll come back to Don 's work 

I 'm not talking about your work really

Uhm  why the light angle 

That that was  I suppose a sign of frustration I suppose cos I had two canvasses working in a space

and uh I 'd seen something I wanted to re-present

and you need two canvasses   one on each wall

and uh

and then I pulled them out flat and then shoved them into a corner cos this is the way it would work in an abstract  you know

I felt that this term I was gonna going to play with some kinds of images

You know affected a lot by the environment and the economics of painting as well

I mean I realised I couldn't actually afford to  vinyl paints  what was going on here

Uhm  turns out you know as an experiment in which  pleasure as well 

It was twenty quid for a pot of paint

Mm

Mm

A pot of paint cost twenty quid

Yeah

Pot of oil paint

I didn't realise

Well how big was it

I think the one I asked for was something like twenty three pounds

and he said  

But it 's uh

Yeah I think that painting 's got a lot to do with the strictures of being in this place and working obsessively there

and uh you need a sort of 

in a way working with those strictures and not being 

I mean I find it ridiculous the things they 've told me 



Yes

Can't you 

Mm



  is over

There 's quite a worrying one in the  for me

It means that you 're a 

I think you 're going to have to change it totally that what you were working on originally is not how it 's gonna going to end up

And I thought of taking it out putting it out up there till  

I mean I guess I was kind of frightened at what happened there cos I did actually  manage to balance them at one point

and I thought

it 's doesn't

either it 's not working or I 'm just uh  enough space 

Mm

Mm

King Charles the Second has returned to England  and uh the restoration of the monarchy occurred in your work 

No see the thing does exist cos I know I can  I can obliterate it

I think that 's why it 's there

Cos you can obliterate it

Yeah that 's how it comes out

 paint the surface  always knowing that I could then  black it out again

Well in a way you 've made more decisions about the surface than you have been doing before 

You seem to have committed yourself to some kind of you know pictorial sensibility 

And I find I think the strongest thing about it is the fact that it 's in a corner in a way

It uh  the one surface is almost reflect a reflection of the other and of course it 's not true  a true reflection and uh  that gives it its you know dimension of originality 

And uh I I 'm normally oppressed by such paintings but in yours I 'm not 

It 's

That 's

What kind of statement are you making

Uhm 

When you 're painting  are you thinking of things like well that bit of red seems to be a bit closer than the other bit of red

and  in front of the yellow 

and think about gold

Yeah

Mm

I mean I 'm composing the painting uhm  but I 

 do as well  suspicious  

Well where are 

Well I 've got a feeling you share the 

I mean I think this is quite a pleasant

I mean correct me if I 'm wrong

but there 's quite a lot of cynicism and suspicion in in 

Mhm

But the barrier is you 're painting on a phenomena phenomenon that we can't see happen  that maybe doesn't happen

What you mean a phenomenon of the light

No your gauze

the gauze that can disappear and and then reappear

Uhm

Well then you 're dealing with the  that uhm

you 're dealing with the  that if you went into a gallery at a certain time of day or you went into a situation and it 'd look different  so 

You know if you wanted to actually photograph it what do you photograph it on a white background wallpaper or whatever

How d' you represent them 

Because there 's no one way of representing it at the end of the day

It just changes wherever it goes because it 's environment dependent the picture 

Well  when you listen to a messenger telling you what happened on the mountain  you have the messenger 's speech  more or less uh being presented at the speed that you would expect of a piece of uhm a news bulletin or whatever

you know that that uh it 's like that

it 's like you listening to uh to the to the news bulletin

But of course it 's actually doing something more complicated because it 's also evoking for you a whole stretch of time uh which you are supposed to uh  which you imagine having taken place off stage

and you may link it with something that the chorus has been covering when it was singing one of its lyrics

So there 's a lot of manipulation going on of the audience 's sense of the happening uh of this play

and one thing that uh I find interesting is that that the dramatists both tragedy uh the tragedians and the comic playwrights tend to use the framework of the single day don't they

They say

in this day  uh X is going to find out who he is

or something like that as in the uhm Oedipus Tyrannus uhm Tiresius says

this day will bring you forth and destroy you when Oedipus says to 

who are my parents

Uhm  i in fact the plays don't take a whole day

they take an hour and a half or or that sort of thing

But they give us the sense that the action that we are witnessing is concentrated into a single day or into a short  period that it 's more than just an hour or so 

Uh and they give us that sense not because there is any sort of rule about unities  and that was a sort of latter-day re reading of Aristotle and we 'll come to that you know in Poetics

Uhm but it 's to concentrate the action

Now often that sense of everything having come to a head and going to be sorted out in the action of the play depends on  the  dramatist being able to evoke through the lyrics and through the narrative speeches of messengers and so on a sense of what has happened before that it 's all coming

Mmm also a sense of the audience that they have no control because things are happening at such a speed that you know that whatever is going to happen is going to happen at the end and the end is going to be very soon  happen

Yeah

Yes yes yes yes

and one of the things that a playwright needs to do is not only to give you a sense of danger and excitement and dramatic climax but also to give you some sort of shape of things to come isn't it so that you know how long you 're going to be sitting there for before you find out what happens to Oedipus

or

Uh in in broad terms you have something to expect

Uhm isn't a lot of this time though

it 's not only chorus

I mean like there are monologues at the beginning of speeches and also in the middle of speeches by some of the char by some characters who actually say that  say that whilst the scene 's been happening then this has been happening in say in the other part of the palace or somewhere else

Yeah yes  that 's right  that 's right but when they do that it 's like us listening to our neighbour who comes in and says I 've just seen an accident in the street  or a news bulletin over the radio

But when the the chorus is performing its lyric

Yeah the chorus don't

they tend to uh all make it as if it 's  what 's happening at that very time because they 're able to uhm mimic because they were trying to say mimic in voices so they would be able to mimic some of the voices

They some they sometimes do

Yes  or at least they can act out  uhm uhm when they recall something like the the duel between Heracles and Achivaras or 

They can they can sort of evoke that uhm as a piece of timeless lyric so it seems 

Uhm uh i it 's sort of uh  performed for us almost in the songs or dance

Yeah

Uhuhm

Also they might have been sort of symbolic movements to suggest sort of certain actions which the audience would understand

Yes

Yeah

And that is going on at the same time something else is going on uh

somebody can come in at the end of that chorus and say

oh uhm Herus has arrived

and here he 's got news about Heracles or whatever

and so it the chorus has this very peculiar kind of function of being able to cover  uhm  sort of unlimited amounts of of of time that are passing in the intervals between the the dialogue scenes 

And it and it 's because they are using song and dance and the conventions of lyric that the audience can relate to that and feel perfectly comfortable with this interchange

and that 's the thing that for modern audiences is peculiar  isn't it  the the sort of formal interchange between ordinary uh uh dialogue exchange

and then these sort of uh  detached  lyric performances coming at fixed points during the during the play

Yeah

It 's also very useful isn't it because uhm it means that anything which really couldn't be staged any action then can simply be put in the choral  passages and like uhm well Odysseus 's and Silenius 's description of the uh how the Cyclops kills the sol the the sailors and how he eats them which really couldn't be performed on stage but is crucial

and in that way the sort of the satyrs are able to  mimic the fear of the

Yes yeah

Yeah yes yeah yes yes yes yes yes

Yeah and they can make it more vivid yes yes

It 's also easier to understand I mean what 's going on in the play

you know presumably I mean the audiences at that time knew all the legends and were all very familiar with the play

but it also gives you sort of the basis of understanding

Cos they give you a summary of what 's going on and who 's who or

 so you know it 's easier 

Yeah

Yeah

Oh I think there are a lot of ways in which

I mean after all when you think that you 've got a an audience of fifteen thousand people a lot of ways in which the play has to be very accessible 

Uh you never know whether everybody there is going to know some of the background to a particular story

In any case each dramatist can change details of the story so long as you don't make  Orestes marry Clytemnestra or something like that

So long as you keep the broad outlines it 's clear that they do all sorts of things and they introduce  characters 

Uh I mean just take the later plays  to illustrate that

So  there 's a lot of clarifying that needs to be done

and I think this point about the sort of  dramatic  enacting by the chorus acting out dancing and singing certain key moments in the background to the story is something that we should take into account

But with all the dancing and singing isn't it more a just a visual and uh an aural break anyway because the intensity of the dialogue so often is is quite heavy going

so it 's not quite light relief because in most of the tragedies it definitely isn't

but it 's uhm

a change is as good as a break in a way 

and so a change in style is going to be keep the audience awake

Yes

Oh yes yes

I think that the uh uh the the lowest common denominator must be variety and uh relief and  aesthetic pleasure to be got from the song and dance and the last time we were talking  about the implications in New Comedy by the way for the changes of choral practice that instead of having a written out chorus  which is related to the themes of that play you get a musical troupe who comes along and does its  repertoire  uhm uh which may be a standard New Comedy repertoire that this particular group has for a number of different plays

Now uh that would provide uh the the the point that Eleanor has made that it satisfied the need for relief and variety and so on

But there was a long period when they seemed to think that there was more that you could do by making the chorus sing and dance things that were relevant to that particular play and only that play  like in the Agamemnon

I mean all fifth-century tragedy uh and uh the fifth-century comedy that we have the chorus each ode is evidently designed for that bit in the action

Then later they seem to have got a kind of multipurpose  

Mmm

I I mean it was there purely as a uhm just a break

I meant it 's all part of that the same action it 's just as it 's a completely different style from the dialogues that you do far more with it that 's it 

Yes  yes I see what you mean

You 're making a formal point yes yes

Giving the audience  time to think

It does

It wakes your senses up anyway if you 've got a whole load of some vast numbers singing and dancing

Yes  yes 

Oh I think that 's true and and I don't think we should overlook that

I mean we tend to because we haven't got the the choreography 

That 's one of our difficulties

It strikes me that there 's a fundamental difference say between sort of the uhm Old Comedy  choruses that they seem to all be a character in their own right

There are a lot of characters in their own right I mean particularly in The Birds where the  point out every particular bird but whilst uhm the ones in uhm sort of uhm tragedy  really don't seem to want to step out of the action a lot more easily

Yes

Yes

Oh yes  yes the particular  yes yes

Yes

More from watching the script

And they don't get individualised I mean

it 's true that in comedy not only do you have the different varieties of bird  in The Birds you also have in the  uh individual members of the chorus named 

and in The Wasps

Now in tragedy you don't ever get in say the Oedipus Tyrannus  uh Oedipus saying oh hello X and how are you Y and this kind of thing

and that would seem quite inappropriate but it

and it 's partly to do with the notion of what is  the degree of decorum uh appropriate to tragedy isn't it that it 's more dignified if that group is not broken down into individuals 

And so comedy is exploiting other sorts of possibilities that that aren't really  quite available to tragedy

I think that 's true

Yeah

Mmm

Mmm

Yeah and in The Wasps

Yeah

Mmm

Yeah

Mmm

Mmm in Old Comedy they don't seem to sort of like uhm mirror the emotions of the audience either in the same way that in tragedy they do

In tragedy there 's a definite sense that they uhm sort of play yeah they sort of bring out the emotions  or they emphasise what the audience should be feeling also predict  in certain ways uhm in in minor ways how the play is going to go 

Things which are very covert  but which sort of suggest that

say  the play is going to take a sudden surprise and what they 're suddenly going to observe is going to be slightly different from what they might  have first thought

but it 's still a surprise when it happens

No



They speak they speak for the audience

Yes

Yes

Yes  a sort of guide yeah

Yes

Yes 

What what was the example you had in mind

Well uhm sort of uhm just

I can't think of any particular ones at the moment

It 's something I was doing 

 but isn't there a part in uhm  in one of the uhm 

in one of Aeschylus 's trilogy there 's a part where Iphigenia 's prophesysing prophesying what will happen and the chorus also 

sorry yeah Cassandra and

and the chorus also uh  have a moment of prophecy 

Cassandra

The chorus are often talking about themselves in the Agamemnon as if they were prophetic  uhm and they they use language about themselves 

Uh they talk about their prophetic heart

Uhm when Agamemnon has gone in for example uh they they 're worried

they express their fears as if they were prophetic 

but there 's a kind of irony because when Cassandra is offering them some much more hard uhm clear-cut uh predictions they 're saying we don't want prophets round here thank you very much because they 're afraid of the kind of things that she looks as though she 'll come out with 

Uhm yeah there 's a there 's certainly some play in the Agamemnon with uh with the chorus 's attempt to interpret being expressed in in the metaphor of uh of prophecy

Right

So so you 're making a distinction between an executive summary within the executive report  is that right 

OK

So within the executive summary you 're going to make a a pithy comment about or s synopsis of the  economic viability of the the project 

and you 're also going to put the project in in relation to existing  demands for this particular uhm material

Yes

Yes

OK 

So having established that part of the  design then what are you going to do

What are you going to do after you 've introduced the summary 

What else  do you think needs to come out of the work that you 've done on the on the design  that it 's important to note 

Things like timescale  or 

Well you 've got your costing  

Strikes me you you 're putting all the emphasis at the moment on on the costing

I think there are some other things that that came out of the design that uh were also important to note 

Special features 

By which you mean



How easy it is to get the equipment



Right

Well the the flow sheet with the equipment on it is just going to be uhm essentially a statement of what you require isn't it 

But I suppose what I 'm trying to get at is just as with the economic analysis you said 

this is the world market

and this is where we fit in 

uhm  you ought to be saying  identifying if there are a any particular problems associated with the equipment or any particular technical  aspects associated with the equipment 

So for example when you 've been looking at the design of your process are there any uhm  features of the equipment that you 've had to pay particular attention to 

Are there any particular  issues associated with the production of penicillin which are perhaps you know perhaps make it different from other processes

What sort of things have you have you had to think about very hard in in the design process 

Can anybody give me some ideas as to what those  features might be 

I think what you need is some sort of list of what these fe features are in fact 

Anybody going to ma get the ball rolling 

The fermentor

OK but what about the fermentor

Is there anything particularly distinctive about that fermentor 

Well it 's it 's the one equipment that we designed and I mean to detailed design and uh

OK but why did you design the fermentor 

It 's the core of the process isn't it  

Yeah 

OK

Well that that

That needs to be specified more than any other piece of equipment

Right

OK

Yeah

As you say it 's right at the heart of the process isn't it 

OK 

Isn't it true to say that if you get the get the design of the fermentor wrong  the costing wrong then the rest of the process is is a little bit academic isn't it

Mm

Mm

Yeah 

OK

So you would actually say I would have thought within your executive summary something to the effect that  your the detailed design work you 've done has been focused on one the the key element of the design uh sorry the key element of the process  which is the fermentor 

Now what about you John

There are some particular details of that fermentor design which are  important 



So  taking those points is there anything that within the penicillin process that you had to think about particularly carefully or that you 've actually put quite a lot of thought into  in terms of the design of the fermentor 

It 's



Right 

OK

So one first off is the influence of the of the organism type on the fermentor design

Yeah

Good 

Can you think of any other categories which come out from that

There are some other properties of the organism aren't there

What about the  the rheology of the broth

Does that make a difference to the way in which the fermentor is designed or and operated 

You 're nodding your head  Victor

What what particular problems does the fermentation broth  pose

I think relatively high power requirement  cos of the 

Right 

OK

So what I 'd be looking for then in that section would be for you to pick out those details that you think are  peculiar or or particularly important to the design of the penicillin process  features which mean that you couldn't have just gone and bought a bog standard  fermentor off the shelf from somewhere else and just expected it to work 

OK 

But at the same time are there other things that you need to put in the des in the executive summary  related to  errors which have still got question marks over them 

I mean are there still some problem areas I mean on the design  apart from the entirety of the thing 

Can't think of anything offhand 

Surely if you went back over the design now you would and looked for the number of times you used the word assume  it 'd be those assumptions which would be the things things that you 'd need to pick out in your executive summary because clearly where you 're making an ex an assumption there 's a  you know there are question marks aren't there

You 're having to make certain  uhm  guesses or estimates of of of the properties of the fluid or or  making estimates as to the way in which the process is going to perform

So are there any particular areas which are  more prone to you know have got more guesses in than than in other areas 

Mm

The recovery process 

Mhm 

Yeah

But that 's a pretty big term isn't it

I mean that 's two thirds of the process is is recovery

Are there any

Could you be a bit more specific than that

Could you home in on

Mm

Yeah

Polishing stage and uh  broth extractions

OK 

So you could again then identify that there are particular elements of the downstream process where  you had presumably insufficient design data on which to base your design 

and you could go further than that and s and perhaps make some recommendations that those would be the particular areas that you 'd require to to invest some more research and development in it to to actually tighten up on the cal calculations in those areas 

Uh I think that 's quite an important point isn't it that maybe when you come up with these areas where there are question marks and you 've made key assumptions that those are perhaps the  you need to try and relate those assumptions and the the errors in that area those areas back to the economic sensitivity analysis

So for example you could say 

if the downstream processing calculations were are in error by a certain amount then this would be we can accommodate tho those sorts of inaccuracies because within our sens our sensitivity analysis has shown that the project is in fact viable with plus or minus ten per cent or plus or minus twenty per cent  error 

Why do you think it 's important to try and tie the  tie those two together 

Or do you think it 's important to tie the two together

That 's the meaning of the sensitivity

Yeah

I in relation to   

And also like cost estimation 

It 's not a completely   calculation

Yeah

Yeah

It it 's not it 's not acc it 's not an accurate thing

You 're dealing with a feasibility study which is plus or minus thirty per cent  at best perhaps even  plus or minus three hundred per cent 

Uhm  but you you 've got to sh try and show that the the bits where you 're plus or minus three hundred per cent are not critical to the overall success of the project 

Is that right

Yeah

OK 

What about aspects of the uh  plant layout or the way in which the actual process is going to run

Are there any key details that need to come out of that that you need to report in your executive summary 



Sorry



Toxic



Well where does toxicity come from



Yeah

Right

OK

So I think within the executive summary you ought to be making a statement about the way in which you approach the design

What 's the design philosophy in terms of the layout 

You know you 've made a distinction between flameproof areas and non-flameproof areas and you need to justify that as well

You need to explain why you 've done that

What are the advantages  of dividing the area like that 

Does the production of penicillin impose any particular constraints on the sort of land we can use

I mean if I 'm going to look for where I 'm going to site this plant are there is there anything that I 've got to have available 

Does it have to be near near a water source for example 

Does it have to be near a supply of lots of electricity

Are there any other constraints sort of geographical types of constraints that you can think of 

You need water  uhm in cooling 

You need water  

Electricity   

Right

What 's the other thing you need to have in order to operate this process 

Availability of materials 

OK

Availability of materials

But there 's something else even more

Manpower

Right

Manpower 

Have you thought at all about the  nature of that uh  labour force  about the composition of that labour force 

I mean how many people are you going to require to run this plant 

Any ideas John 



And on what on what basis do you assume two hundred





Right

It 's a continuous process

I i it 's a moot point

but I I I think uhm you probably wouldn't be able to get people to work effectively for up to twelve hours

so I think you 'd have to have a three-shift day

otherwise you 'll have people falling asleep on the job 

But is this plant going to be uhm highly automated or not 

And what implications does the level of aut does the level of automation have on therefore the  the level of man manning and the sort of manning you require 

More computers

Less people

Right 

So what sort of process have you got here  Victor

tell me

It 's a process

An automated process

Yes

OK 

So then what are the implications 

Are you really going to have around two hundred people like John has on his penicillin plant

or are you going to  try and get away with fewer

Uh fewer 

OK 

But something 's going to happen I think

If you go towards a more automated plant I think the nature of the skills that the people will have will be different  apart from the fact that they 'll need to be able to stay awake like hyenas   

What sort of people are you going to be employing  if it 's going to be an automated plant

Uh skilled people 

So now does that make a difference

If I decided I 'm going to put this plant in a Third World country is it going to be as easy for me to find  relevant personnel as as it is if I 'm going to put it in a developed industrialized country like uh this one

No 

You might do



Right

So you need to think carefully about the  the quality and the sorts of training these people would have had in order to to be able to be competent to run your process don't you 

But it 's not on a green field site no this plant 

I can't remember

Was was it a green field site or or was it adjoining an existing 

Yeah

It 's joining an existing plant

OK

But have we said what that existing plant is doing 

No

Except

And it may be old technology as well mayn't it

So I I think you need to raise the question at the board level don't you

Yeah

So uh you 've got somewhere within this exec executive summary a statement to the effect that this process will require this sort of level of manning  uh by these sorts of people  and for these reasons we believe that it will require to be situated  in a certain  s sort of location  in certain having access to certain sorts of people 

I think John your two hundred 's an order of magnitude out 

I should think the number of people who would actually run a run a process like this would be really quite small

But you 'd need to think carefully about the number of support people required to actually administer  a process like this

Because you 're going to be producing material for clinical use  eventually there 's going to be quite a lot in terms of quality assurance and backup  uh taking samples  those samples in in a laboratory in laboratories 

So with no existing rules to specify that it is an all-male club the Committee decided to throw the issue open to the members

It 'll need a two thirds majority to see it through

Now the ex-Glamorgan captain and former test selector Wilfred Wooller has already voted against it

And so we thought we 'd bring Wilfred and Rachel together

So on to the hustings as polling day at Lord 's closes in four days ' time

Why for instance is Rachel so keen to break into this peculiarly male institution

It 's basically that I think perhaps immodestly that I 've become associated with cricket over the years and I would love to be a member of the greatest cricket club in the world and it 's it 's just as simple as that

It 's not for any feminist reason

It 's just that I would like to be able to say that apart from I don't know whatever the letters I have after my name oh M B E that 's right I could also put M C C

Wilfred Wooller in Cardiff

I mean to admit women as members

Well hello 

I voted against this in my paper last week which will go through to the M C C

It 's one of the few havens  left for men in my view

The Lord 's pavilion is an excellent piece of  cricket architecture built for men

If ladies were admitted then hot toilets bathrooms showers and certain other rooms would have to be  reorganised to meet feminine requirements

Is that the only reason

No

I am a member of several clubs and two or three of them particularly Bell 's my county club don't admit the ladies

Ladies somehow or other they they never seem to uh gel together when they are in a number They

You will always get personalities getting into it somewhere

I can just imagine some old colonel uhm sitting in the front of Lord 's end of the pavilion and found some lady 's nicked his seat 

There 'd be an uproar

I wondered what you were going to say

she 'd nicked then for a minute

But as far as my experience in cricket 's concerned Wilfred I think that any woman who wanted to join the M C C would honestly and genuinely be doing it for the sake of cricket and their love of the game

I don't think for one minute that they would be doing it to cause a problem

I mean you have thousands of women watching top-class cricket in this country

In every other county cricket ground throughout the country women are able to be members of the club although I gather at Glamorgan it 's uh sixty-two pounds for a husband and wife membership and eighty-four pounds for two full members

So I don't know if Glamorgan also devalue women as well

Rachel I I think you 'd probably get away with it if you were not permitted to go into that pavilion

I haven't requested to go into the pavilion

I ha I 'm sure the women would accept the fact that they well I would personally that I might have to sit somewhere else in the ground

In fact you get more sunlight sitting down at the other end of the ground

So Rachel you you are you saying therefore that you 're prepared to do all this to be a second class citizen as it were

Not really because I mean if all seventeen and a half thousand male M C C members turned up at Lord 's for one test match som somebody would have to be sitting on somebody 's lap somewhere

and they couldn't get into the pavilion

So there would have to be provisos made for that eventuality

Y You know Rachel you might have a chance if you if you got that accepted that that pavilion was sacrosanct to the men most probably because they want to be on their own

I think the pavilion Lord 's pavilion smells like a well-oiled bat and it 's full of memories

I mean you can't counter that with a whiff of Chanel and and and some face powder

I don't think it 'd go down at all well

But I wouldn't 've thought there would be any objection to the ladies being uh outside that

They are there everywhere in different parts of uh Lord 's aren't they

Thinking that to be

Wilf are you living in in the modern world

let 's be honest by saying this

I would 've thought very much so because we are an an endangered species we men and we sportsmen

There are very few clubs now which 're exclusively male

I I accept the inevitable

and I 've nothing against them the ladies except that it 's very pleasant to go into a man 's club and don't have to worry about what you are saying what you are doing and how you 're doing it and what you know what 's going on and being distracted by some attractive young girl round the corner 

You 've got to concentrate on cricket uh

I think a lot of men at uh cricket they don't concentrate

I I uhm

do you no notice the sort of clinking of the glasses in incredibly particularly in the hospitality boxes at the the major test match grounds

I think there are many women who probably would take it far more seriously than some of the men who are only there for the  

I can assure you Rachel the ladies drop down as much as the men

If they uh produce as good a cricketer as you and you took advantage of those nets at Lord 's you 'd put put the fear of God into a few of the players there

Flattery might get you everywhere Wilf

Perhaps there 's the fear that if they develop uhm M C C category general membership for women perhaps there might then come the move that a a woman might  be

Captain of England 

Well it Well then they 'd certainly have to sort the loos out at Lord 's

Well we 've just been entertaining the ladies ' rugby team here at Cardiff 

 jolly good thing

well as long as they play among themselves

I tell you what

There 's a number eight playing for England there  about six foot two and fifteen stone

She kicked like a mule

We were all for that

I think also Wilf I was just going to say

there 's been an interesting precedence set in that uhm Mr John Major has leapfrogged nine thousand members uh to become a member of the M C C

Uh I think the only other thought I have is that perhaps if I fail in this respect pep the only other option left to me is I shall have to become Prime Minister

I tell you what Rachel

I was wondering

You see the men wear these extraordinary ties

I mean what will uh what will the women wear I wonder

Well I am sure we could uh develop uh a very tasteful chiffon scarf of some sort  not to put over our heads and with our rollers underneath

If not I 'm sure we could have a very discreet uh lapel badge or something like that 

Women might be able to make a valuable contribution to cricket

I I mean I could think in some respects that I might be able to make some suggestions to the future success of the England men 's cricket team

Well that 's a

Well

My God they need it too these days

So uh don't debar women from being able to contribute to cricket because after all women did invent overarm bowling in eighteen hundred and five and then it was adopted officially sixty years later by which time everybody had forgotten that it was a woman who made the suggestion originally

And W G Grace was coached by his mother and she didn't do a bad job and neither did he

So we have played our part in the history of cricket

One o One of my theories in all sport it 's the mothers who do most to develop their children at a young age four five six

Fathers can't be bothered to bowl underarm to them and the mothers do most of the work

I think I 'm

I think we 're almost winning you round

Perhaps you 'd better get that voting paper back again

Wilf bless your heart

and here 's to Wednesday

Well perhaps we 'll see Rachel up at Lord 's one of these days

I tell you what I 'll

I 'll buy you a Cherry B if you are a good boy

Ah thank you

Rachel Heyhoe-Flint and Wilfred Wooller

The M C C decision on women membership next Wednesday

also a big day for football

So another weekend 's Sport begins

and I hope it 's a very enjoyable one for you all

Goodbye now

Well that 's not all that different Soutier from what the C B I is saying is it

I mean you you see a slowdown in the rate of the recession uh but you don't see any upturn

That 's right

Our latest survey 's looking at what people are doing in the high street

And what that shows is that  the consumer demand is essentially flat on its back

We 've seen no recovery

It 's been no better in June and no worse than it was in May 

And retailers ' expectations point to some modest recovery in July but you have to bear that  in mind that their expectations have not fully been met since since March

So they 're fairly cautious about the future

Well if that 's true Jackie about consumers that is bad news for the Government 's hopes of an upturn because the government this government has been pinning  nearly all its hopes of getting out of the recession on consumer spending on the consumers dragging us out

But if the retai if the high street doesn't show any sign of that  how and when are we going to come out of this recession

The uh survey that we carried out is slightly broader than the C B I 's in that it embraces all of the service sector plus the manufacturing sector 

Now it 's the service sector  the banking and the financial community that are m the most optimistic at the moment  but a lot of what they 're saying is pinned to the export market the overseas market rather than the  the domestic markets

They don't expect 

But we 've just heard that our balance of payments is about to widen again

That 's right 

Which is slightly worrying

And the manufacturing industries in particular are in very severe uh recession and they do not expect uhm a substantial improvement in their performance over the next six months

If anything their  prospects are less optimistic than the than the service sector industries

I don't understand why the service sector can show any optimism

We we We 've learned that uh  the banking profits of the major clearing banks are going to be down by about a billion pounds compared with the the the equivalent figures last year 

As I understand it people in the City are still being laid off

White collared jobs are being lost right left and centre

Certainly in the financial services sector we published a survey last week which showed that the the downturn in business was still expected to continue into the autumn  and banks in particular were facing a pretty hard time

So there aren't any  signs of improvement in the financial services as yet

But there is some  good news in the sense that the sharp downturn that they may have seen at the beginning of the year is beginning to slacken 

So in in our view what it all suggests is that that we are approaching a turning point in activity and that 's when you do get confusing signals in the economy

We 're approaching a turning point but we haven't reached it yet

When is it going to be 

In my own estimation the the turning point of the economy certainly  is not going to be till the back end of this year at the very earliest

There 's no  turning round the corner  coming in in sight

By the back end

You mean close to Christmas I assume

I think so

That certainly is what how it 's looking like

Jackie 

We We 're slightly later than that

We 're saying the first quarter of nineteen ninety-two

Oh

So you 're actually more pessimistic than the C B I on this

In terms of the an upturn yes

In terms of stabilising the London economy  we 're slightly more optimistic

We see the economy

 better news for London

but you 're not you 're not any more optimistic on the economy as a whole  for the whole country

No

And I think it 's also dangerous as well to assume at the moment that the upturn in the economy will run parallel with uh employment levels 

Th th There 's a big shift away from uhm  companies improving their performance in recruiting people

What we 're seeing is that because of  the the squeeze on profitability companies are no longer recruiting

in fact they are actually making people redundant

And that 's a trend that 's likely to continue well after the economy begins to upturn

Good evening

To outsiders London seems one of the most vibrant cultural capitals of the world  a city bright with theatres cinemas ballet opera art galleries and great museums 

But to many Londoners including some of the stars gathered here tonight these are dangerous times 

The arts culture and entertainment industries together make up London 's third largest employer after the Government and the City

But for so many of these people the whole business is in crisis

And they 're now preoccupied with preventing theatres from going dark and I quote London from becoming the marginalised capital of an offshore island 

This is the man they accuse principally the Minister for the Arts Tim Renton

But they blame local politicians too 

Are they right

Should there be more government funding 

Or are there better ways of spending public money than subsidising artists and performers who can't attract an audience prepared to pay their costs and wages 

Melvyn Bragg you 're President of the National Campaign for the Arts the lead signatory in the letter part of which I quoted a few moments ago

What do you think 's gone wrong 

Well before we start to talk about finances which 'll occupy a lot of this programme and blame which 'll occupy a lot of this programme the reason why I 'm we 're here and people are watching is because most people think that the arts add something to their lives that nothing else will give them

It does affect millions of people

It 's not an elitist activity

And properly handled as it has been over many years in the last thirty or forty years it reaches right out into this city on every level

And that 's important for people the quality of people 's lives 

What 's gone wrong I think it would be silly just to sling mud around

What 's gone wrong is a ga general breakdown of central investment

I refuse to call it subsidy because what the governments have got back Labour and Conservative for putting money into the arts is far more than they 've given in the first place

On a national level in a national company centred in London Jeremy Isaacs and others will speak better than I will

On the London level the Boroughs ' Grants Committee seems to be breaking down

The turmoil caused by the poll tax has meant that a lot of local uh boroughs have been pulling out and even reneging on their promises

Theatres like the Almeida which has a wonderful record have been cut by twenty per cent

The Dance Umbrella one of the great dance festivals has been heavily cut back

A London-based company Temba again this is central funding affecting London is virtually going to be eliminated after twenty years of of very very good production service and so on and so forth

So without there being a conspiracy there 's been a concentration of mishandling and ineptitude and lack of regard for the main condition of arts functioning in a great metropolitan city which has led to this

I think we can almost call it a crisis

John Mortimer you 've been in the business a good number of years

Haven't you seen these crises come and go before

Isn't this an age-old story

The arts are always in crisis

But I think it 's very important to realise that  our position England 's Britain 's position with the arts is somewhat pathetic 

We 're bottom but one of the European list

And Ireland is the bottom

But we 're the second bottom of the European list of supporting the arts

And if there 's going to be any Conservative

Government support for the arts is that

Government support for the arts

And if there 's going to be any Conservative criticism of support for the arts on purely monetarist Thatcherite principles the arts is the best investment we can possibly have

It 's the third biggest employer of labour

More people go to arts  performances than go to sport

And uh the arts the whole arts industry not only produces arts it produces tourism it produces restaurants it produces hotels 

It not only produces that we have the best actors we have the best directors we have the best arts performers in the world

And the whole image of England  in the world depends on the arts

It doesn't depend on politicians

Who on earth remembers who was Prime Minister when Dickens wrote

Who can remember who was Secretary of the Council when Shakespeare wrote his plays

Politicians go

The arts are what we depend on for our reputation in the world

And we are selling them  really rather short at the moment

But Glenda Jackson politics is an essential part of this

I mean many of those in the vanguard of the complaints at the moment saying there is a crisis have declared for the Labour party

Now you 're a  Labour candidate 

Are you not uh  uh honest enough to say that there is a good deal of of party politics involved in this at the moment

Yes but it was a Conservative government that has systematically rate-capped so many Labour-led boroughs in and around London

The issue I would like to take up with you on your introduction was saying that the crisis in the arts is caused by the arts itself because it can't suf attract sufficient numbers of people who can actually cover its costs

And yet the the list that Melvyn read out were established theatres that have been established over quite a few years many of them and have a proven track record of indeed being able to attract audiences who come back again and again and again

And the thing that concerns me more about the present crisis in the arts is that there is enormous audience out there in London both of home grown Londoners and of the tourists that come and they are being denied access to the arts

And that for me is the most serious aspect of all 

But the question arose

Tim Renton as the Minister you 're cast as the villain of the piece  in this the prince of darkness

Do  you accept that that you are the villain

And do you accept that there is a crisis 

I think being Prince of Darkness is actually quite an attractive title isn't it 

Probably more attractive than Minister for the Arts in some ways

But let me just deal first with two of the general points made

I mean first the politics of this

As you 've just said Nick this is politics does come into this

And one has to say straight away I won't say it again during this programme but all three  who 've just spoken are active supporters of the Labour Party

Glenda is a candidate in Hampstead Melvyn and John Mortimer were both at the top table of Labour 's great dinner the other night

five hundred pounds a head a fund-raising dinner

So they all are committed to the Labour Party

Fine

There is politics in this

But I agree very much with what Melvyn and John both said  that the arts are vital to our lives a central part of what goes on in London  and we should do everything we can to encourage them

I take the position very firmly that the Government and I as the Arts Minister through the Arts Council because every penny we give to the visual arts and the performing arts it goes through the Arts Council we have in fact been doing very well

Last year for the Arts Council twelve and a half per cent more than the year before

This year eleven per cent more than the year before

Way ahead of the rate of inflation 

Where there is a hang-up there is really a problem is with the London Boroughs ' uhm so-called London Borough Grant Scheme 

I 'm sure you 're going to talk about it more later in this programme

But I don't think that that is ar an arrangement  this uhm decision-making process in the L B G S that anyone can be proud of 

And uh beyond that there

Many of them are Conservative boroughs of course

Yes I agree with you

And I am not going to try I 'm not going to try and sort of remove any part of the responsibility from them

What 's actually happening in London at the moment is immensely exciting

Last week alone we had two new galleries opening one in the Royal Academy  one in the Victoria and Albert

Two weeks ' time we 've got a new wing opening at the Tate

So a great deal 's going on 

And in the specific uh theatres that have uh oh just been mentioned the Almeida for example

Now the Almeida is actually getting two hundred and thirty-eight thousand pounds from my office through the Arts Council this year

It 's eight per cent up on last year

But they 're not getting any money from their London Borough through the London Borough Grant Scheme

That 's fallen off the table

The Royal Court of which John Mortimer is the Chairman is actually getting an eight hundred thousand pounds ' grant again from the Arts Council this year

Nineteen per cent up on the year before 

So I would say that we the Government through the Arts Council are doing our stuff

London in many ways in the arts world is is booming and bubbling but there is real problem with the London Boroughs 

No let John John Mortimer come in there

Uh I just want to to take  because I want to thank Mr Renton very much and

and I certainly wouldn't cast him as the Prince of Darkness 

And I would like to say that i it 's the Labour councillors o o on the Greater London Arts Board who are who are more to blame than anybody for for cutting their subsidies to the arts

So it isn't a question of po

We 're not going to turn it into a into a narrow political debate about who sat at the Labour Party dinner

Melvyn I think that that was a a an amusing an amusing jibe

But it was a a jibe  too



Abs I was about to say absolutely 

But an amusing jibe

But what you tried to do was to pretend that criticism of arts policies is to do with the Labour party

I was to I heard on the radio this morning Lord Sainsbury

I don't know how he votes

He may or may not vote Labour

But he was speaking very strongly in terms of criticism of arts policy and what 's going on in London

It 's it would be a waste of time for people watching this programme to think that this is a party political split across the board

And I represent the I 'm President of the National Campaign for the Arts which has dealt equally with every party that 's come to it for information

And we can prove that any time you want

And they are deeply concerned about what is happening to the basic investment in arts throughout London

It isn't

Let me bring in Russell Fielderson because he he s runs something called Crisis in London Arts Funding uh

And yet I think viewers first have to be persuaded  many of them that there is really a crisis when you look at the latest uh A Arts Council Report the forty-fifth uh

It 's published a year ago but we checked with them and they still stand over it 

They say the last year of the decade offered a profusion of evidence that Britain is enjoying a Renaissance and that central government local authorities and the private sector are all placing a higher priority on the arts than ever before

It seems that in every city in the land art galleries concert halls and theatres are rising from the ground or being splendid renew splendidly renewed

Artistic production is growing

It goes on and on like this

What is the crisis 

I think one of the main areas of crisis is

and the minister will forgive me saying this uhm

but local authorities put in as m put as much into the arts in London as do uh central government

and there 's no co-ordination 

And if you look at boroughs the boroughs in London are suffering from uhm both charge-capping and from spending limits

They 're cutting education budgets

And the Arts Council has been provoked into uh instituting a survey of local authority arts cuts

And we haven't yet seen that

And unfortunately there isn't a me representative from the Arts Council with us tonight so we can't ask the question direct

Guy the the incredible thing is that you 've now written this year music for all Shakespeare 's plays

This has sort of crept up on me except I had to wait twenty-one years for the Two Gentlemen of Verona

To your knowledge is there anyone else in the world who 's ever achieved this extraordinary thing

Certainly not for the same company

I would imagine that n nobody has done such a thing

I mean various companies uh over the years have attempted to do the entire canon of Shakespeare 's plays but I can't imagine that one composer would be uh employed for the entire project

Certainly the B B C Television Shakespeare has used many composers

Guy how did you get into this business of theatre composing

I I started at uh at Cambridge as an undergraduate and I I spent my three years playing in every orchestra

I was a horn player  uh or conducting them or writing uhm theatre music

I even auditioned Robert Tear for a small singing part in Love for Love by Congreve

We We 've called him back for a second go 

We weren't quite sure

Well Cambridge is one of the things you two have in common of course

Did you meet at Cambridge

No we didn't uhm

I think we must 've been in the town at the same time but uhm  

We didn't meet at Cambridge and we didn't in Ipswich either although we were both born there

We were both born in Ipswich

Uhm yes 

I don't know whether

But we certainly met in Stratford

We met uhm  very early on in my career with the R S C

Guy had already been there for two or three years

And uhm very quickly became friends partly I suppose because of our shared backgrounds uh but partly because we found ourselves working together on projects and just wanted to renew the experience over and over again

That 's right

Trevor what about music in your life

Does that come into the picture very early on for you 

Yes it 's

I I 've often been asked wh why did you uh give up on Shakespeare and and move over to the musical theatre in the sense that I I I 'd uhm sold out

But actually from my earliest recollection I 've been interested uh in both uh the spoken word and the sung word

and I used to perform uhm myself

I used to perform songs

I used to do cabarets of of all kinds

Used to devise shows

And my earliest memory of the theatre is going to the Hippodrome in Ipswich and and hearing a pit orchestra t tune up and feeling a terrific surge of excitement that I couldn't place

I had no knowledge of what I was listening to but just feeling

It 's a great moment of the turning over of the stomach for those who are about to perform isn't it th th the the sound of the tuning up

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

To come back to the question of your collaboration and the collaboration between directors and composers in general uh

This is really quite a problem I imagine

And to talk specifically about The Winter 's Tale

we started with a a bit from that in a very rock version of Autolycus 's song presumably to match your style of production Trevor

Is that right

It was a very contemporary version of the play al although most people responding to it didn't feel that it had been updated to a specific period

It was a slightly futuristic production I suppose

It was very pure in in its visual style

It was the first production at Stratford to use a completely white set design

There was a white floor and a white box and Guy used uhm various instruments like a a sitar

But how When When you began to know what the style of the production was presumably that 's the beginning for you

is it

Or how does it work out

That 's a very good question

I I I always get really turned on to the the style of it by the look of it

I mean it 's assumed if you work for the Royal Shakespeare Company that you 've read the play or seen the play or even collaborated on a previous production

Sometimes this is a very dangerous assumption

Uhm

Very  very dangerous

And then of course the director talks to you about it all

But it 's only when I actually see the design

And it was the design of the that Winter 's Tale that that 's caused me one of many nights up because we had a dance which you can't avoid in the second act the Bohemian section of Winter 's Tale which is usually called the sheepshearing dance

And Trevor had worked out with his choreographer a wonderful dance where they were all whooping and shouting and screaming but stamping and making a lot of physical noise and he said no we don't really need any music for it because they are doing it themselves



This was wonderful until they got on to the white set which had a white carpet floor where they were virtually inaudible

Uhm so I had the unenviable task of writing a dance to the very complicated steps that they 'd already worked out and I had to sort of deliver it in about twenty-four hours flat 

Do you always work very quickly

Uhm no but I I try not to let the actors down when they 've got a song or a dance because they got to do it and it 's got to be rehearsed

But incidental music unlike a film you can't time it

you can't tell how long a scene change is going to be really

You can make guesses You can

You can write themes

You can sort them out

But over the many years I worked for the R S C with the best will in the world the incidental music

I tend to worry about it for six weeks

and it comes out in a rush in in a week

Uh in the case of other composers that Trevor 's worked with like Stephen Oliver

I remember on on Nicholas Nickleby Stephen literally writing the incidental music during the technical and keeping one scene change ahead of Trevor

Trevor do you ever do you want to reject a piece of music that 's for you

I mean you discussed it with the composer whether it 's Guy or somebody else

But if he comes with something say

no I that absolutely isn't what I meant

Uhm

Sure yes

Uhm absolutely

Guy and I have a very good relationship in in that respect of uh give and take and discussion

And actually on a number of occasions Guy will uh uhm will come with an idea for something a jotting

and I will see it

and uh uh I I don't think it 's it 's right for that slot

but maybe if we adapted it and we used a a slightly different uh r rhythmic quality to it we could place it somewhere else

And that that often happens doesn't it

Uhm

Uhm

I think the the secret for a director if he wants to talk to a musician is is actually putting the right penny in the right slot and and making a suggestion

I mean b be it through just the use of a the word you know

Like if someone says a medieval fascist fanfare you know what it is

You don't want to be told how it 's scored

Was it a medieval fascist fanfare you wrote for The Revenger 's Tragedy or something near it 

I think it was a Jacobean fascist fanfare certainly yes

All right but that was the first collaboration between you two

I believe

Nineteen sixty-six

That 's right

M My memory of it is that I I 'd just done the David Warner Hamlet Peter Hall 's Hamlet and Trevor was allowed to build his set within the Hamlet set

Yes it was an extra production that season for which there was really no proper budget

and Peter Hall said to me



And therefore the there was a sense that it was a production that was fighting for its life

And it it uh it employed most of the junior members of the company uhm

I remember one of those junior members was was Ben Kingsley  with a three line part

That 's right three line part

Yes

And And of course Ian Richardson played the lead and was was absolutely stupendous in it

But uh it gathered around itself a real fervour because it was it was thought to be underfunded and in some sense undernurtured

But uh I will never forget uhm uhm my response and the company 's response uh on stage when the band turned up and we went through the uh the music cues for the first time because so much had been exciting up to that point but uh nothing at the level of that excitement because uh a whole world was conjured up by the music

So sometimes I suppose it happens to everybody

you get a piece of incidental music which is very exciting that it that it actually affects your production

Oh yes one one one yearns for it

Uhm certainly in the production I did of All 's Well that Ends Well uhm I was seeking for an atmosphere that was uh was rather intangible

I I find it quite difficult to put into words

And Guy wrote a piece of music that was plangent and Chekhovian in quality

and I used it frequently during the production to provide an atmospheric sense that I wanted the text to have

And I would just allow this music to to swell up behind scenes

And I think w w without an audience specifically understanding that they were being influenced by music

It became a very important part of the expression

I I remember that production

Great fun this

I mean it was the last time Dame Peggy Ashcroft appeared on stage in an R S C production although she 's of course going on making films

And I think we should say that it was an updated production but a half update

And in my memory the thing that sold it to me as an updated I mean it was sort of just turn of the century was that there is an officer class implied in in in the structure of that play and the the daughter of a poor doctor falling in love with the wrong chap

And it 's very difficult to do

In Elizabethan costume you can't tell a sergeant from a private whereas when you 've got the sort of Ruritanian costumes that we we we adopted it 's very easy

It actually helped the play

And those sort of updates I don't mind at all

Uhm

Of course you nowadays present Shakespeare plays and other plays of that period in in all sorts of uh periods

And you 've just done a modern dress Timon of Athens for example

But occasionally you you want the atmosphere of that of that period of the sixteenth or seventeenth century

I mean in in that piece we 've just heard from The Revenger 's Tragedy it 's a mixture isn't it of original instruments and kind of what sound to me like modern  trumpets

Do you use original instruments a lot of that period

Uhm

Yeah

Oh yes we do

I mean for for instance when Trevor and I did the the whole of the the Roman plays that 's to say Titus Andronicus Coriolanus Anthony and Cleopatra Julius Caesar I used curved Roman trumpets which I 've had specially made

When we sometimes need authenticity in the look as well as the sound uh we go back to the medieval instruments like the crumhorns and the rauschpfeife

And in the sixties uh one of my greatest successes you know as as an engager of personnel which is part of the the theatre 's job uhm was to get the services of the great David Monroe who worked with us for two seasons

Spectacularly in the case of uhm The Taming of the Shrew

For those of us who remember nineteen sixty-five one or two of our listeners may  Tory party uh leadership contests used to be uh as the cardinals in Rome and leaders would emerge

But now it 's all on the front pages and television and radio and what not

Do you approve of this development Mark Lawson

Uhm I think it 's much more exciting

I think for most people politics does only really get interesting when the human drama comes in

and I love all the little subtleties of it that  somehow in the Conservative party for some reason to write an open letter to your constituency chairman is different from making a speech in which you criticise a Prime Minister

And I just love the judgements of it

like Michael Heseltine this morning reading ministers in the papers anonymous ministers saying he 's going to do better than he thinks  has to decide whether that 's a complicated double bluff to try to make him run now

And I love all that kind of treachery which is what Michael Dobbs 's book is about 

Well  that 's two cheers for treachery from Mark Lawson

John Mortimer 

Yes I I think it 's infinitely more entertaining

And I think the only real value of politics is that you should make people laugh 

And uh so therefore I think that it adds greatly to the gaiety of the nation

And what I think is is really funny about it is that these people are totally  to follow the fiction that 's written in the newspapers

I mean the newspapers make up a story and then they obediently trot in and try and perform it

Hilarious

Hear hear

You speak here in in a s a double capacity because you 're not only legal man and Rumpole man but you 're Henley man 

Well actually I I haven't got the uh the uh joy and entertainment of being one of Mr Heseltine 's constituents because I live just across the corner in Buckinghamshire

So whatever you 're just that little bit of an outsider Mortimer

I 'm just a bit of that  

You get away with it yet again 

Heather Couper what 's your view of the uh of of the upfront fighting if we can use that clumsy awkward

Don't forget it is Monday morning

 If I can partly misquote John and say yes indeed it adds to the gaiety of the country

That 's not the appropriate word at this time of the morning but still

I think it 's all jolly good fun

In fact I went along to the House of Commons to watch an adjournment debate on Wednesday night last week and uh I loved the way everybody postures and poses

I it 's like ballet really in a way

And and here we have it you know enacted f full frontally in front of us

And uh of course you can take bets as well

So it it 's a bit like a sport really 

I 've never heard the House of Commons likened to full frontal ballet before 

I 'm sure Michael Dobbs 's book is going to tell us more about that from what I 've read about it

Nice thought  wait for that 

Pete Davis what 's your view of this

Well  one can be tremendously earnest and say how unedifying the spectacle it is having all these chaps saying how  full wholeheartedly they support the Prime Minister when you know that it 's more than likely that they probably will either not vote for her or abstain 

So I 'm all I 'm I might you know I get uh I give it the entertainment vote the same as everybody else

I think uh  the more open it is the better because the more the politicians have to squirm and I enjoy that 

It 's getting like the American system isn't it really

Yes it is completely unreal  cos you know that next to nobody is actually telling the truth 

We 're being very unsympathetic to politicians on this programme which is most unlike the usual way this programme is 

And undoubtedly this will be reversed by Michael Dobbs who 's been assistant to Margaret Thatcher and to Mr Norman Tebbit

Uh you don't take any pleasure in in this do you Michael 

Well not pleasure because I actually happen to think unlike most people here that there is a serious side to politics and uh unfortunately  uh we get a very little chance to focus on that at times particularly when the politicians themselves act in such a a a ridiculous way as some of them are at the moment 

I it is a serious process

The leadership election should be a serious matter

But between the politicians and the press  it all seems to be turned into something of a carnival

I I was talking for instance just the other day to a a journalist who 's actually personally in private life a strong supporter of Margaret Thatcher uhm

But he was saying in the uniquely cynical way of Fleet Street he said

you know

no I 'm so bored with the same old people telling me the same old lies

He said

What I want is some new people telling me some new lies 

Uhm and the the the there is there is this feeling that uh amongst the press I think that they want to have a lot of fun

and they are clearly helping those who would uh want to you know make sure that the calm seas of Tory politics are turned into turmoil

Some would say that the press and and the rest of the uh media are just taking their cue from the politicians themselves and they 're not creating events they 're reflecting them

That is that is a view

In your  uh book House of Cards which is now turned into this four-parter for B B C One y you 've said that you said that uh that you believe that this is ninety  per cent realistic and ten per cent uh invented

Do you still stand by that 

Uhm no

I 've rather modified my view

I think it 's more like ninety-eight per cent realistic and two per cent invented although I have to say it is not a comprehensive view of politics because I mean literally

Look when we 're having a kick at the politicians  and you know th it 's right to have a kick at the politicians we we still ought to remember that uhm uh the vast amount of politics is still about people actually wanting to to do something better for the country

But  you know there is this this part of them which is silly which is malevolent which is wicked

and that 's what the headlines and obviously novel writers focus on

Well I 'm intere we 're interested in somebody like yourself who 's had inside track knowledge not only working closely with the Prime Minister

You were working closely with Norman Tebbit and working closely with Saatchi and Saatchi

And uh and you say it 's ninety per cent realistic

You present us with a view in this book uh uh and in this adaptation a a view of the Conservative party which is what you mainly deal with of a a chief whip who is devoted to blackmail  of MPs who go to bed with prostitutes and take cocaine who believe in double-crossing each other all the time  who are the nastiest uh group of people that uh  I 've come across for a long time

And you say this is ninety-eight per cent realistic

Sounds like uh honest natural realism to me

No no no no no

Uhm the uhm in my own defence I ought to point out that the book doesn't mention the word Conservative or Labour

It is actually about political folk

And I think that had the Labour party been in power for as long as the Tory party had we could be having the same sort of discussion with one or two details word

I 'm not denying that at all

I 'm just saying you c uh I 'm just referring to the book that you 've written and that uh you can't pretend that Francis Urquhart the landowner pheasant shooter is anything but a a a representing a Conservative whip

I I I was horrified uhm

In the book you 're absolutely right that uh many of the most important decisions about uh treachery and  backstabbing for instance are made while he 's out shooting

And I was horrified on the front page of The Mail over the weekend to see Michael Heseltine with his stalking cap on out shooting 

Michael when when does the rot set in if there is a rot

Uhm for instance you know when you have nice councillors who are terribly caring for their their constituents and when they become MPs they become these terrible cocaine-sniffing beer-swilling  landowners

Uh wh what actually happens on the road to Damascus

Uh uh nothing at all

We we we seem somehow to put politicians uh on the one hand put politicians on a pedestal when in fact we shouldn't

They are normal human beings

They 're just like the people round the table except we put them under the most unique pressures 

 surely they 're human beings with a fatal flaw in their characters which is they want to boss other people about

Normal sane people don't wish to boss other people about just in the same way that I think normal sane people don't wish to be judges 

Uhm yes I mean the the the clearly to go into politics takes

It 's a character defect that makes them go into politics

Yes uhm w

No I I wouldn't agree

I I I I I still think that you find that most people who go into politics do so from a mixture of reasons but one of those reasons is actually to do good for for other people

However being in politics is a huge

Well it 's it 's extraordinary how how little they succeed if that 's what they set out to do

Well that that that

Also you can talk about them wanting to do good which

I 'm sure  a percentage of them may well want to do good

But it isn't a question of uh  how much good they want to do

but simply that once they get to Westminster the temptations strewn in their way must be so many

It 's not the pressure  or the wanting to do good as simply the distractions and the temptations must be monumental

No I mean you you 're you 're right to the extent that the the pressures and the temptations on politicians are huge

I mean there are such things as as political groupies

I mean any politician who uh wants a a you know uh wants a quick legover can get one frankly because uhm

He he 's advised by the Conservative Chief Whip in your in your play uh the uh of various knocking shops in London where he can do this safely isn't he 

Uhm yes

  

I 'm just quoting from you

I mean I 'm just a a humble viewer and reader just grappling with my thoughts

And there 's one word division bell I think isn't there  uhm

 





There 's a

Is that true

Or is that just the things journalists say

The the thing that amazes me is how uhm is is how people expect politicians to be different or somehow better than other people

They 're not

They 're just the same as other people except under much greater stress and under much greater temptation

And for instance there is  drugs in the book

I do mention drugs in the book

Everybody knows politicians some politicians get drunk some politicians  uh uhm sleep around 

Why should they be different from other people in in being free from the modern problem of of drugs

It 's not

Drugs are beginning to be a problem at Wents Westminster and if we close our eyes to it I think we just miss the point

Mark Lawson

The the the clever the central idea of your book which is very clever is that you took the idea that a Chief Whip because he knows in the nature of his job everything about everybody else in the party could theoretically start blackmailing people

Now obviously that 's uh partly a comic idea

But I mean how much of that has gone on

I mean you can talk historically if you wish 

Uhm whips are there to put pressure on people

I mean the whole point about being a whip is that you whip them into shape and you use all sorts of pressures in order to do so

Now whips uhm a are normally intent on getting people to vote a particular way getting them into the lobby

And what I 've simply said is that the pressures which you put on people to force them into a lobby are directed to other ends personal ends

Uhm but the potential certainly is there

And and far be it from me to suggest that every politician or indeed every whip h has been uh pure and chaste over the last fifty years

Uhm

Uhm



Thank you Mr Freeman

Height 





Thank you

we 've got the picture

So Daphne aspect is east west

What would you put there on it in it or whatever

So this is in fact a retaining wall isn't it

It 's retaining the soil on the higher side of it

Uh I wouldn't put anything on it I don't think because two feet isn't very high

But what I would do is I would plant things in it as you go along especially if you are concreting it

Uhm

but it 's far easier to introduce plants into a wall as you 're building it rather than try and dig a bit out when you 've finished and then shove the plant in because all sorts of problems occur

I 've tried to do this and it it doesn't work nearly as well

One thing I would include I think would be the Campanula the Dwarf Campanula Birch hybrid because that has such a long flowering period

It 's a lovely blue

Some of the Sedums obviously would be quite satisfactory the Sedum Spurium

Sedum Spurium on its own I think is rather boring but there 's one called Erdblut which is a gorgeous red

And especially when you get the sun on it in the afternoon it just absolutely lights up

I would also play around with some of the Alpine Phloxes because they would just about if you uh introduce them at the top of the wall would just about reach the base of the wall



Thank you Daphne 

Uh

what you got to offer Fred

On the top of it I would be wanting things like things for winter

maybe to give you some winter colour Pulmonaria Dianthus which will give you silver leaves during the winter uh Hepatica Nobilis which are like a little tiny uhm anemone mauvey blue beautiful little thing that flowers around about February March time

and it 's beautiful

And in the wall  why not Gypsophila Repens which is the uh trailing Gypsophila with tiny little pink flowers

and in that situation it 'll look beautiful

And Aubretia of course would do well there

Alyssum Saxitile would do well there

And if you do plant Aubretia get several colours named varieties

and don't forget

once they 've flowered cut them back almost to about two inches

and they 'll blossom out the following year and give you a beautiful show 

Thank you Fred

Uh there 's just one set of plants that I would like to add to that for the top

and those are Pinks because some of the fragrance you 'd have then in the  late spring early summer when you 're sitting out on the patio you could imagine yourself away in  Arabian Nights and all that business



It does doesn't it 

Thank you for the question Sir



Next please













Right we will answer you I hope Mrs Simmons

It 's a seedling Rosa Canina the dog rose it has two three feet long shoots or stems and Mrs Simmons ' team would like to bud onto it to form a standard fr rose tree 

And she wants to know when to move it uh before or after the budding

Fred

A lot of standards are actually grafted onto that kind of a rose 

And because this is in the wrong place and it 's already got two shoots I think I would cut off the weaker one or the one that isn't quite as straight in the best position

and I would then move it

And I think because it 's still only the end of February I would might move it now straight away

And I would then leave it where it is until about July August and then I I wouldn't graft I would bud

I would bud onto the top of that stalk

And when you 're budding of course you want to put three four or five buds onto the top of that stalk to make sure that wh if they do grow even if one or two die you 've still got plenty left to give you a good head

And all you need to do is to uhm make a T-cut in the stalk itself that 's the dog rose and just get some patches out for the rose you want to bud on

just make sure that the two cambium layers join together

bind it with some tape

and make it airtight

and I 'm sure some of those roses will grow

In fact it 's far easier to bud a standard than to bud ordinary bush roses cos you don't get backache when you bud standard 









And again Fred when is the best time to do it

About the end of July August so don't go on your holidays at that time

Right 

Stefan 

If you 've never budded roses before th the secret really is to make sure that the buds don't dry out at all

You must keep them moist

and after you 've taken the  uh you 've removed them from the parent plant  wrap them even if for a very short period of time in damp in damp tissue paper paper

You must keep them moist

It 's not an easy thing to describe in words but any good rose-growing manual will show you how to do it

You make a little T-shaped slit in the bark and lever it back

It 's one of those things that always looks very much easier in pictures than it is in reality

and the first time you do it you 'll chop a little bit too much and make a mess of it

Uh for that reason if for none other then I should put several around around the top of the stem

But I would have thought that with uhm  you know with a reasonable bit of uhm bit of luck you should get at least one of them to go

Immensely satisfying when they do





Well Stefan is quite right

That uh bud must not dry out at all

In fact uh an old friend of mine  who was something of a rose expert

and he took the bud

and that bud was in his mouth  uh so that it never dried out until it went into the T-slit

Daphne anything to add

When you tie a standard rose and this applies to any standard rose whether you do it yourself or whether you buy it you really need two ties on it

You want the first tie immediately under the head

and th the uhm stake should be carried slightly into the head so it doesn't snap off with the wind so that you give the head support

and then you need another tie to make sure that th the stake and the tie don't whip about

That needs to be about halfway down and that should remain for the whole of the life of th th the standard 





But it 's something

I 'm glad you 're doing this because it really is I think uh very exciting to take cuttings or bud when you 're creating something yourself 

Good luck



Thank you

Do we have another question 





Thank you Mr Freeman

Yes young inexperienced gardeners

The pity is often they 're discouraged from gardening aren't they because they don't know where to start 

So what reference books are best to help them

And let 's go down the table starting with uh Stefan 





I 'm tempted to say I 'll strike a bargain with you Daphne

You scratch my back and I 'll scratch yours

I was I was going to Stefan actually

Oh were you

Because Daphne 's book uh a first rate book a very a very dumpy thick volume chock full of information has appeared under two titles I think

It was it has appeared and you may see it called Simply Gardening

You may also see it called The Idiot 's Guide to Gardening

Fi same information

First rate well written  borne out by experience from someone who is both simple and an idiot 

And if sh if she recommends my book after that I shall be very surprised

Could I

Could I just stress that it 's the book it 's the book that 's thick and dumpy and not s s Daphne

Oh yes

perish the thought

But could I just say one other thing apart from apart from buying buying Daphne 's book

Uhm I I think that uhm once you 've spent your money on that the thing to spend your money on is a subscription to the local horticultural society  uh because the the local horticultural society really does provide the best reference source imaginable because you 're you 're there you can talk to more experienced gardeners you can talk to gardeners of all all degrees of experience in fact and uh and

and that really is the way to learn 

Hear hear

uh Daphne you 're not going to recommend Dr Stefan Buczacki 's book are you

Well I was but I 'm not 

When I was a young and inexperienced gardener a thing that really whetted my appetite is a is a a very dumpy thick tome or a a series of tomes that you can't get your hands on for love nor money now which was sold in four and sixpenny weekly instalments called the Marshall Cavendish Encyclopedia of Gardening

And because it came weekly it introduced you a little bit at a time

That is a a marvellous volume

When you see all these other things that are re-introduced on the television you wonder why on earth Marshall Cavendish don't do this again

However as you can't get that the other one that I would recommend is P B I David Hessian series the expert series

 th he starts off by The Garden Expert which is very basic and and really treats you as though you 've never had a garden before

And having uhm worked your way through that and really got interested in the thing then he breaks it down into the fruit and the vegetable and the flower and all that sort of thing

And I often say really Dave Hessian has done what no garden writer has ever done before or will ever do again unfortunately 

Yes I agree Daphne

The Expert books are first class well illustrated as well and it 's all so simply explained

Uh Fred would you agree

Yeah Yes

I would Clay

but uh I think uh my advice would

first of all join a horticultural society

and g get some interest going

and then once you 've joined the horticultural society I would then buy them a radio 

and I would tune to Radio Four every Sunday at two o'clock 

Then they should hear a lot of tips

they get some interest then once they 've got that interest going and decided where they are going  uh there is a a list of books called the Wisley Handbooks  which are speces specifically about one subject

They 're only about three pound ninety-five or something each and you can buy one of those and then build up a library

And I think there 's almost fifty of those

so y whatever subject you 're interested in you could then follow that through

Uhm

Now I reckon you 're a  what shall I say a well worn gardener like myself Sir aren't you  and you

Yes 

I 'm well worn

I don't know anything about you

And uh  we 've learnt haven't we that books are all right but there is nothing like uh the help you get from society members as the team have said and doing it yourself 

Yes the thing is we we do notice very much that there 's difficulty in attracting younger members to the societies 

I think they come along and see us old fogeys around and they don't come back again

At this at this point uh we ought to bring in Stella Horrocks to the tune of haunting weird music

Imagine it please

Uhm she receives novels from the other side

Uh seventeen years you 've been at it haven't you Stella

Uh yes since nineteen seventy-four

Uh wh wh how did it begin

Were you sitting one day with a pen in your hand and an author came through

Oh oh no

No it doesn't at all 

I wasn't really interested in this sort of life at all

I didn't even know it existed until I went on a holiday to Scarborough once 

And it was a wet day

and I went to have my fortune told for something to do 

And the medium came 

And she told me that my father who 'd died many years before was standing by my side

And she actually described the tie he was wearing that I 'd given him for his Christmas before 

And she said there 's a lady standing at the side and her name is Alice

Do you know an Alice 

And I nearly passed through the floor

That was my mother 's name 

And she died the following October and then I got interested in it

Uhm bu  bu  but when you 'd got interested did you actually sit down and try to receive novels from dead writers

Uh no

I was I I was invited as a guest 

Uh a friend took me to the local spiritualist church as a guest

And the medium came to me in this open circle 

And she said various things

And she said you 're going to write 

And she said and your Uncle Victor is standing at your side

Have you got an Uncle Victor

Yes I had

Uhm

Just as well

I had 

Yes

If she said father or mother I should have thought pooh pooh and just laughed it off 

And I said after what to do

She said go home

She said take a pencil and sit and put it on the paper and just see what happens 

So I did and nothing did

Just like Monica said

nothing happened 

So I was fed up

I thought oh gosh I 'm glad there 's nobody watching me here

They would think I had a slate off  as we say in Yorkshire

Sounds like one

So

Yes yes

So I turned the television on 

And then I looked

My hand was going on its own

As soon as I stopped concentrating hard and was relaxed it went

And how does it write

Is is is it

And it it went all all squiggles and lines and all sorts of things

  

It 's very peculiar writing isn't it

It joins together

Uhm yes

And then for months and months it went like that

And then gradually words evolved 

I am a retired teacher and I broke off because I were doing uhm exam reports and uh I was so busy in the summer term

And when I started again in the September I said now if nothing comes you 've had it chum

Whoever you are I 'm not going to bother wasting my time

And now when I told it off

We have arguments

Why did you think something would

And then it happened

The words came

Now who was it coming through then 

Well I didn't know till later it was my guide 

Everybody has a spirit guide

Yeah but but was it an author wh that was writing or or uh not an author

Uh no

It was my spirit guide  a man called Paul 

He had been a monk at Kirkstall Abbey  long long time ago 

And he was writing too and gradually it evolved 

And my first real author to come through was Guy de Maupassant 

And he was writing something

I said who is this

Now I 'd never read any of Guy de Maupassant 

And he wrote that name Guy de Maupassant and I thought that strikes a bell

Who 's that 

And then I went to the library and got it

And the first book  was written by Guy de Maupassant

Yes

Uhm

Why was he wri

Some of

So I 've read this I 've read this Guy de Maupassant story of yours

And it is actually quite like a Maupassant story 

Uhm but why isn't it in French 

I mean wh what would make Guy de Maupassant decide to write through an Englishwoman

Uhm

Ah

You know I 've been asked that so many times

This is it

What 's the answer

Think think of uh two examples

Think of the Bible and the Day of Pentecost 

They went out into the marketplace to speak to them all

Yes many tongues

And everybody thought they were speaking their language 

Think of uh a better thing

Think of the United Nations 

Somebody speaking in a language

and they 're all tuned in with their earphones

and they 're being translated

Oh many tongues on the other side

Yes yes

But it 's not it 's not like me don't know whether you 'd agree with me

it 's not like a French writer is it

I don't see a French writer voluntarily writing in English

No but don't you think perhaps it 's rather like with mediums

They may have a genuine talent and they really are in touch with somebody who 's dead

But what comes out of the medium may be very trite because the medium has a trite  mind and th the dead person who is trying to communicate can only do it through the physical presence of the medium or of

But do you but do you believe that this

They can't make the medium a genius

Uhm 

Well no

And so it 's bound to come out in in her sort of  the terms she would use

Well

But it 's it 's very uneven because I mean

The the Maupassant story is actually quite Maupassant and quite good

But the Dickens

You see your great-great-grandad here

I mean this does not sound like Dickens to me the the bit you 've given us

Can I can I read it just a little bit so people get the idea

Uhm it begins with a preface







That doesn't read like Dickens to me

That reads like someone thanking somebody uh at a Rotary

It is it 's just it 's just a a letter on the end

Uhm but the the Dickens itself reads more like Dickens does it

Oh yes definitely

I brought some with me this morning

Uhm

But what what do people think of it who who are familiar with the authors 

Far more

Well I haven't I haven't been able to check much of the handwriting

But there was a Dickens of London exhibition in Bradford Library 

And there were letters there all in cases 

And I went there

And somebody had told me about it

A friend told me

And I took my stuff down to check it and it seemed to fit the handwriting

It looked the same did it

Yes so I went upstairs I went upstairs and I brought the archivist down 

And he checked it

Got some things out of his cases

He says it seems to bear a similarity

You get  for writing don't you

What 's your normal handwriting like

Is it anything like y t

tell you what

Oh not a bit

Show show us here just

just sign your  sign your name there 

Yes that is not very like the spirit writing that that burbles along the page

You you 've got the writing of a of a neat and tidy retired teacher with no nonsense in her

And this  but this this writing is quite different

Yes

But who receives novels

Oh yes it 's different

I 've over two hundred people contacting

and it 's all in their own different handwriting not just

not just writers

And is it all right handed 

I mean do different writers write different uhm

And you were you act you were yeah

Uh one was a left-handed and that hurt 

I i it went it went

No not a backhander

not a lefthander

backhander 

And that hurt

Does it

Uhm

Right

But surely out of two hundred writers you 'd expect seventy-five or something to be left-handed  when they were actually writing to you 

A few backhanders yes

Backhanders

No I 've always written with my right hand

And do you get people who were desperate to be published but never managed to be published in their  

It 's always famous people carrying on 

No laundry lists from Elizabethans

No I I no it 's been the famous people

And I had a lot of ordinary people friends uh relatives and so on  and my own relatives

Uhm what what does it feel what does it feel like when it when it 's happening

Are you kind of taken over

Are you in a trance or what

Oh no I 'm not in a trance

Well what does it feel like

Uh just writing ordinary

I just try to relax my mind

Why don't I believe you Stella

And then it rolled off

Because so many people are sceptic

I can tell you why you don't believe me

No I 'm not a sceptic

I just don't believe you

It 's because nobody will believe me until they 've had their own psychic experience

But are you sure that all these people writing are not just facets of yourself that you are a frustrated writer and for some reason or another in your life you haven't been able to do any creative writing and it 's spilling out

And then they will

Oh no they 're not

No I 've never I I 've never wanted to be a writer at all 

That 's perf that 's perfectly true

Who would

You still don't

And you still don't

It 's still perfectly true

No

Every now and again I get really fed up

I 'm wondering well what on earth is going to happen next

And lots of people ask me well why do you go on

I think it 's out of curiosity

I want to see what happens next

I always liked a good story for a starter  and I like to see how they finish off

Does it interfere with your life

I mean are you sort of y you it was a seven hundred page novel that Dickens dictated to you

I mean this is this is a great amount of work

I mean do y do you ever reject them and say no I really want don't want to do automatic writing

I 've got shopping to do 

They don't take up too much time then

No I 've enjoyed doing it 

But the the thing look the thing is if you 're in this kind of work you 've to have plenty of other interests on the other side your side of life

And I have plenty of other interests 

Otherwise it could just take over

Monica you 're a writer

What do you make of all this

Are   from the other side

Well I uhm I believe that anything is possible unless we because we have no proof that it isn't so

But I still believe that  what is

I mean let 's say Charles Dickens is communicating through you

It 's still  got to be through your through the medium of you and therefore the writer

I mean that would explain why the writing is not that of Charles Dickens

No way

And also perhaps th the story and the characters may be different because without you knowing it it 's your interpretation

Do you think that 's possible

Uhm

Uhm  isn't it slightly

No not really  what you can do

You can't really judge a writer by just reading an odd few lines

You have to read the whole com the whole thing

But it isn't there something faintly degrading to about to to the writers of the idea that they are these sort of lost souls after death who have to keep on trying to send garbled stuff through mediums

Well they 

They wouldn't be

I mean what 's the good of being dead if you 're still trying to get published on earth

We 've been through all that

Well I think that I I think there 's other things to come afterwards

It 's not just the books

There 's so much other stuff come through which I 'm I 'm not going to mention

And I think I don't think they 've done it for nothing just to entertain me

I feel sure that someday it will be published 

That 's my ambition

Barry did

Barry have you ever heard for instance any of the stuff that Rosemary Brown uh the the musical medium wrote

Yes yes as a matter of fact with gr with great interest and fascination



Kenneth Clarke 

When it 's clear that uh United Nations resolutions are being complied with 

And that means straightforwardly the unconditional withdrawal  from Kuwait uh so that we can restore the legitimate government

And it 's been quite clear before this ever started that if Saddam Hussein would undertake to do that and had done it by the deadline there would have been no hostilities

Hostilities will cease once it 's clear that he is going back within his own territories and ending the invasion

And yet in his address this morning President Bush referred to destroying his nuclear capability and destroying his chemical warfare capability

There 's nothing in the U N resolutions about that

is there

Wh well I very much hope that the  nascent uh nuclear capability the chemical capability he has are being damaged very severely in the current action

I hope that although I hope the other loss of life associated is kept to the absolute minimum uh

But I do believe we made it clear all the way through that we are insisting that the United Nations resolutions are complied with a

and that means an unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait

And uh once that has clearly been established we all hope these hostilities will end 

Roy Hattersley

I agree with that entirely

Uhm the hostilities end  when Saddam hu Hussein accepts United Nations resolutions and we get a withdrawal from Kuwait 

When he 's out of Kuwait or when he says I accept the resolutions

I don't think saying it will do

Uh the record of Saddam Hussein does not lead us to believe that what he says he 'll do he necessarily will do

It has to happen

And when it 's happened when there is a withdrawal when there 's the acceptance of the United Nations resolutions and all they stand for then the hostilities will end

The Prime Minister was very explicit about that this afternoon and I believe very reasonable about that

Now on the subject of his chemical warfare capability and his nuclear weapon capability

and again the Prime Minister was very clear

Uhm that has to be terminated but it has to be terminated by other means than war

When the hostilities are over and there is a general settlement in the area then something has to be done which avoids the risk of chemical or nuclear w warfare being initiated uh by Iraq

But that is not one of the objectives of the United Nations resolution and the Prime Minister could not have been clearer about that today

And I support him entirely in what he said

Paddy Ashdown

Well Mr Rogers asks exactly the same question as I asked Douglas Hurd last week in the debate uh

And Douglas Hurd and the Prime Minister as Roy Hattersley has said today have been quite clear today about this

And I 'm delighted that they have been so

for the aims of our operation in Kuwait are limited and specific

and they are as instruments of international will upholding international law supporting the United Nations uh i in order to achieve the terms of the U N resolution which have the standing of international law

When those resolutions are fulfilled or are in the process of being fulfilled then operations can cease

Peter I think the important thing I think this is understood by people in Britain in a way which I think perhaps the rampant jingoism which I see expressed in some portions of the British press do not understand is that the people of Britain do know are not in a jingoistic mood for war

They do understand that what we are doing we are doing with grim determination to uphold international law because we believe that we can only build stability and peace in the world on the s on the basis of a strong United Nations and a strong basis of international law

That 's the process of it

Bu bu but Paddy it would be compatible would it not with the U N resolutions  for Saddam to remain in power and for a lot of his military and nuclear and chemical capacity to remain intact

Yes

Yes

It would be compatible with the U N resolutions

That is therefore not the aim of the military operation

It may well be an outcome Peter devoutly to be desired

And it could even be an outcome which we would wish politically but it is

under under und under cover of the U N resolutions is it legitimate to smash his nuclear and chemical  capabilities  and to kill him

Yes because yes because you are 

Uh i it 's not uh I think legitimate to go out to kill him uhm

But I think the the the the key element here is what is it that you have to do to liberate Kuwait because those are the terms of the U N resolutions

You must take out uh Saddam Hussein 's airforce in order to liberate Kuwait otherwise that would be impossible

And the same applies to their chemical facilities

I think what is not legitimate is either for us to seek by military force to overturn the government of Iraq though that may happen in the process

nor is it uh legitimate for us to acquire and I under  line underline the word acquire ir ar Iraqi territory

We may have to go into Iraq

Indeed we have done so in order effectively to liberate Kuwait

But we cannot acquire Iraqi territory under the terms of the U N resolutions

That 's the limitation uh that is placed upon our actions

And it 's a limitation which is understood by all three political parties and has been clearly expressed as Roy 's se said today by the hou by the Prime Minister in terms which I think are helpful and useful uh in a just war leading to a just peace 

David Sheppard

I think the uhm words unconditional withdrawal have some uneasy echoes to some people

And I think it 's perhaps worth making the point that those words mean what they say and they don't mean unconditional surrender

Uh a number of people uh have memories of the Second World War and a a sense that  the possibility of an opposition in Germany uh overturning Hitler and bringing about change was was weakened by an insistence on unconditional surrender

That 's not what is being asked for

An unconditional withdrawal is right

The the one  piece of of real good that could come out of all this is the United Nations acting with authority

collective security for the world

And it would be a tremendous evil  for that authority uh to be flouted and for an aggressor to snap his fingers at it

And uh if the United Nations authority can see an aggressor  out of his gains then I think little nations round the world will sleep easier

And I think if he snapped his fingers at them and uh it was not seen to be fully obeyed little nations would remain very anxious

But if the U N settled for the bare bones of the resolutions and Hussein was left in power  what would stop him doing it all again some time 

Well I I agree precisely with what Paddy Ashdown said just now

It would be devoutly to be wished that his military might was greatly damaged

But uh I think the authority that the United Nations was given is that he should withdraw from Kuwait or be made to withdraw from Kuwait

and that 's what we have to do

Ken Clarke if he were left in power with a lot of his apparatus intact what 's to stop him doing it again sometime

Well another of our our aims in the area is to s seek to pursue a lasting and peaceful settlement of the area

And I really don't think that 's compatible with the continuation in power of Hussein the building up of nuclear capacity chemical capacity again

But that in answer to the question does not mean as we 've all emphasised that the military operation is going to be pursued to achieve those ends

I I actually believe that it 's extremely likely that if he is defeated when he 's re re are in Kuwait if he 's removed from Kuwait if he has to accept unconditional withdrawal you simply will not have the same regime in Iraq

His power base will go

Uh in the subsequent peaceful settlement of the problems of that area the problem we hope of Saddam and his military machine will really be removed

Right

Mr Rogers you asked the question

when should the allies according to you cease hostilities



I 'd like to hear some more from from our audience on this

Gentleman in the uhm striped shirt



Kenneth Clarke

Kenneth Clarke

N N No it certainly does not as uhm as Paddy 's just said and uhm actually  normally I 'd be amazed by the unanimity

In fact on such a serious occasion I think it 's quite impressive

Uh the the the fact is that it must be right for our troops to go into Iraqi territory

Indeed they 're flying over it and attacking Iraqi targets in Iraqi territory now because there 's on no other way of removing an army from Kuwait

And uh a mere strategic withdrawal from part of Kuwait as part of the battle will of course not not satisfy the U N resolutions at all

In a battlefield uh the line often changes

I it is the unconditional withdrawal

And until we get there uh we are entitled to attack his army this military machine where we have to attack it in order to achieve the U N resolutions

But would th s but could I just clear this up

Would the Government ever uhm envisage uhm occupying Baghdad say 

N n not I w well I can't envisage I mean I cerka certain situations in which the military commanders would say that the occupation of Baghdad has become necessary to liberate Kuwait

But if the military commanders say that it is now necessary for us to move on one flank or another and occupy a substantial proportion of uh Iraqi territory as part of our advance uh I think they have every authority both from their governments and from the UN resolutions to do that

Can I can I just go to the audience again

I 'll come back to the panel shortly

Gentleman in the blue there

Yes

Sir





What do you say to that Roy Hattersley

Uhm Tony Benn is in absolutely no doubt that this is not the United Nations

He said the uh the United Nations had no control over the military action

This is not a U N action

it is an American action

What I say to that is Tony Benn is totally wrong

Uh this is an action authorised by the Security Council of the United Nations

And nobody in their right mind thinks the Security Council is going to act as Supreme Allied Commander and actually chart the course of the war

The forces in the Gulf the multi-national forces in the Gulf are acting exactly in the terms of the United Nations mandate and to talk of it as a United States operation simply misreads history or intentionally misinterprets history

This is essentially a United Nations operation

and I think it 's impossible to argue the opposite case

Lady on the front row here





Paddy Ashdown 

Well  th the basis 

I mean I I admit second place to nobody in my enthusiasm for democracy and in my support of it and it is my wish that every nation on earth had a democratic system

I was looking the other day Peter at the facts and as far as I know in history there has never been a war between two democracies

So I want Kuwait to be a democracy

but I say to you that I don't believe that anybody in this audience or anywhere else has a right to impose democracy from the outside

It is up to the people of Kuwait to decide what kind of government they want

The basis of the United Nations charter is self-determination

Now I very much hope that the Kuwaiti people will in due course choose a democracy but that 's up to them

It 's not up to us to impose it on them

What we have to do is provide the means by which a people can be self-determining to make their own choices in the future

And although I don't accuse you of this I think there is a certain arrogance on the part particularly of the extreme left in Britain on this matter who assume that they can as uh impose a democratic system on people whose principle should be to make their own choices in this matter

Gentleman there





Uh  well I uh no I thi I thin I think that 's I think that 's a quite technical uhm uhm question there

Gentleman there in the grey

I don't think anybody 's saying we are negotiating 

Yeah



Uhm I 'm not I I 'm not absolutely up to speed on who 's paid their subs to the U N 

Gentleman with the beard 

Sir

How much are they



Uhm  good question 

Roy Hattersley

Good question

We I I don't accept the premise of the question uh

But what the gentleman seemed to be asking is how policy would have differed

Well there 's no doubt at all that we would have wanted to see sanctions run on for a longer period to see if Saddam Hussein could have been removed from Kuwait without war

What the Labour   in power

Dr Sacks I 'm not going to ask you to encapsulate your arguments in a few sentences because if that were possible the B B C would feel rather foolish I think at having offered you three hours of air time to develop them

Tell me this however 

your lectures were widely noticed and I imagine you 've had a good deal of feedback since you delivered them

Have you had second or better thoughts about any of the arguments you advance 

I don't think so

I I think uh I rest my case and wait to see what emerges from the discussion

There was a great worry that I had while I was giving the lectures

and that has to do with uh form

I tried to speak about religion in general in contemporary society rather than from within one particular religious tradition

and I did have a worry that by trying to speak to everyone I would succeed in speaking to no one so that the very positive response the sympathetic chord that I seem to have struck at least in many of the people who wrote to me convinced me that maybe some of the subjects I discussed really are of significant importance and that people are concerned about them 

Well there can certainly be no doubt that one has general importance that uh runs through all of the faiths and that is this general idea that uh secularisation means something 

It means that somehow or other religion in the modern world has been marginalised and that other agencies have taken over not only the bodies but the souls of human beings

And in that sense it wouldn't matter whether you were a Jew or Gentile

Uh you could hardly avoid it

you didn't avoid it

What I wonder however is whether we could take it further and ask  the more difficult question about this thing called secularisation

Has it gone to a different degree of development in different aspects of human life physical economic social etc

I have the feeling myself that  lots and lots of people listening think that it 's all over that secularisation means that religion is dead or dying

Your argument I believe is that it 's died so to speak more in some realms than in others and crucially that there is something there left which is the basis for renovation 

That was Professor Halsey who was in so quickly I didn't have time to say so

Rabbi Sacks 

Well I one of the things that struck me was how uh consistently uhm op opinion polls which ask people about their religious commitments seem to show that an extraordinarily high proportion of people in a society like Britain claim to be religiously identified

They identify themselves as members of the great faiths to something like ninety per cent 

Uh on the other hand when you ask  them what actually affects the decisions they make religion seems to play an extremely minor part in their for instance in their figures of influence

A recent uh poll asked young uh teenagers who were the great figures of influence in their lives

Uh teachers came very high

Politicians came very high

Only nine per cent answered that religious leaders played a significant part in their life

And I was trying to tease out some of the implications of this kind of society where we have a nominal affiliation to some kind of faith which seems to play very little part in our lives

And I put forward the argument which could certainly be contested uh but which I have some faith in that some residue remains some flickering ember that would allow for some religious renewal within our culture

But that 's really open to argument 

Uhm

Father McDade did you have  any any difficulty with the main thrust of the rabbi 's argument

Well one of yes  one of my difficulties was that the the process of secularisation was presented very much as a a destructive process whereby the central core of a religious identity of a community 's faith was undermined irre uh slowly uhm washed away by the the the impact of this uh uh scepticism

And yet I would argue that  there 's also the other side that the process of engaging with different cultures which every religious tradition has to engage in and has to address is actually an extremely creative force within the dynamism of this religious tradition

So as as well as presenting problems there 's ways in which for example I would say that uhm  only a conservative religious tradition a tradition which is rooted in its identity has the capacity  to renew itself in the light of new changes that that once those things are lost

And I think that that perhaps in the in the lectures there was there wasn't really a a a an appreciation of the positive benefit to religious traditions of the cultural engagements which take place 

Uhm

Well let me address that directly

It seems to me that for instance certainly within the Jewish tradition it 's very difficult to identify a concept of the secular in the sense of that which is outside the realm of religion

On the contrary there there is the realm of the everyday as opposed to the holy

there is the realm let 's say uh of government as opposed to church

uh but none of these are secular in the sense that they are outside the ambit of religion so that if we have restored an independent domain  of government  which is not government by church by priests by uh religious leaders then I think from a Jewish perspective that 's all to the good

Uh what I think gets lost  uh is the  very creative dialogue of which you speak when people no longer see their seculum engagements that is their careers their  political decisions their ethical decisions as things which on the one hand engage with the world with the seculum  but on the other hand engage with religion as well

When the dialogue is broken when religious people speak only to rel other religious people about conspicuously religious topics and when religion is no longer present in the great dialogues about our culture and our morality then I think that creative interaction is lost  and that is what concerns me 

Yes

Uhm

Uhm uhm

Uhm

Uhm uhm uhm

Mrs Harrison

I wonder if perhaps there 's an im some kind of distinction that might helpfully be made between what you call the need for faith and religion and religious belief in itself because I think if the two gets get conflated  one misses the sense of perhaps a tremendous sur human need  which religion for so long has answered

And I think what I felt very uncomfortable about in in in in the lectures is I think an identification or a conflation that you make between the process of of of reason and of understanding  from Spinoza onwards  which gradually and increasingly exposes  man to a sense of being alone in a  an indifferent a sort of vast and and indifferent universe 

And  the th the strategies then of of individualisation and the search for individual meaning which  has re ha result  in in in a desperate attempt I think on on on on on humanity 's part to defend themselves against this threat this sense of of not mattering of not having a place  in relation to to a benevolent God

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Is that where this residuum actually  resides or or or consists

that uh you 're saying that  if you 're trying to think in terms of essences the essence of religion  is the answer to everybody 's question  what is the meaning of me and the other and the world 

rather than uh what should be the relation say between church and state or or uh how you should r run the priesthood or not have a priesthood and so on

that you 're trying to get at the idea that there there is an inescapable and always itself renewed question for any human being to understand themselves and the world 

If that is the case then I think that we ought to ask Rabbi Sacks t uh uh to uh uh to say more because of course he has said two important things

First that as a Jew he belongs to a tradition which has always been politically powerless  and that therefore there 's a rather special history or tradition of relations to the state

And at another point suddenly he says to us that he would be in favour of keeping the establishment of the Church of England in England uhm as a kind of armour against those forces which are undermining religion

Could it be that that Mrs Harrison is as it were saying to the rabbi you 've got things mixed up here as between what religion is really about and the external relations of religious organisation where you 've got rather a special Jewish  inheritance

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Now let me try and clarify what I wh what I was trying to speak about and what I was very deliberately trying not to speak about

Although the although the lectures are called The Persistence of Faith  I did not speak about faith in the lectures 

I didn't speak about that private dialogue with God  that is my and  m many other people 's private spirituality 

I didn't speak about faith as the answer to those inevitable recurring questions why am I here what is the meaning of my existence where am I going to whom am I accountable

Uh those metaphysical questions uh I didn't address in the lectures

What I did try and address was the  impact the reality faith has in the structures of our common life 

And I tried clearly to say that there are more structures of our common life than the narrowly defined political process 

Culture morality the basic institutions like the family are institutions in which private faith changed the public domain of culture

And I was trying to ask what happens  when faith doesn't disappear  but it just stays locked  in the mind of the believer and never really impacts on the social world in which we live 

And that to me is the concern that I had with secularisation not that people lose faith

And my suspicion is as I say that many people attest to religious faith

What has been lost is that faith as a public presence  as a cohesive and unifying world which we share  and that was my concern

 sense

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Father McDade d' you you remember in I think lecture three uh Rabbi Sacks said at one point faith is not measured by acts of worship alone

Would you quarrel with that

No not at all

No

I I find myself thinking of Pope John Paul the Second listening to some of these lectures you know uh

I hope you take that as a compliment uhm in in the sense that uh there is a there is a an instinct which uh Rabbi Sacks was was bringing forward which I think is very close to an instinct within Catholicism namely uh something like an ellipse between the individual as one focus and the community as another focus and the the inseparability of this with the emphasis being given to the community  and the community experience

I also felt that he was pointing to the the the creative ways in which small units small religious communities actually become generative forces by being themselves at their deepest identity 

I felt he was in fact calling all the religious traditions that that we 're addressing in this country to a a deepening and a centring of themselves with a confidence in themselves and their tradition and their identity and their history in order that in that way they would therefore be able to uhm be generative in the wider society 

Whereas I have a feeling that what what what he was countering and I think countering quite correctly is the the failure of nerve on the part of religious people aper a failure of nerve on the part of religious communities so that the pressure is on them to be private to be unseen to to treat their own faith as in some mea measure a as a personal mythology that 's really of no social uh significance

And I I find myself sympathising very much with  this this

Uhm

Uhm

Let let me give you an example if

I I I  before you do  I I I think there wh some of us are in great difficulty here

and i perhaps Mrs Harrison may be too 

You don't do you want us to  think of faith as a synonym for tradition 

Uh when at least among uh Christians uhm uh uh modern contemporary Christians I think that the problem of faith very often presents itself as an individual problem 

Can I believe in the Trinity

Do I believe in the historicity of Jesus

Do I believe this or that of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England or whatever

And these present themselves to children and grown people as very very very serious personal difficulties while at the same times the the same time those very same people may be fully subscribed to the tradition of a certain morality a set of uh ways of behaving that ha ha have their authority from time immemorial as well as from ordinary reason

There 's a kind of split mind at work there

I know many people who are as it were not going to church very much because they 're embarrassed by the fact that they cannot actually say the Creed 

but that doesn't mean that they won't answer an opinion poll and say I 'm a Christian cum by which they mean that they actually do adhere to the Judaic and Christian uh tradition of morality which wh which is being presented to them all the time

Uhm

Matthew Parris by-elections really are perhaps the most exciting part of politics these days aren't they

Oh they 're absolutely marvellous things by-elections

Uh you say the Tories are on the edge and that 's one of the wonderful things about by-elections

there are so many things to be on the edge of

Everybody 's on the edge of something

You could be on the edge of winning on the edge of losing on the edge of losing your deposit on the edge of being relegated from third to fourth place

They 're like they 're like Greek dramas they 're th

unity of time place action

They 're neat

They 're complete

Everyone knows when they start

Everyone knows when they finish

Everyone agrees what the results are

No one agrees what the results mean

Completely random

Gambling element

Fruit machine element

You can bet on by-elections

Everybody involved in them the politicians the commentators all of us have an interest in exaggerating the importance of the uhm event because it exaggerates our importance

So everybody wins from by-elections

They 're wonderful little dramas

It is marvellous isn't it to see cabinet ministers shadow cabinet people uh very distinguished journalists all these people turning up in a place like Neath where a few years ago people said

oh you can elect a monkey on a stick as long as it 's got Labour support

Uh people take these things in tremendously seriously now

Well they 're they 're they 're they 're supposed to take them seriously because that 's the rule of the game

Everybody knows that the results in fact have absolutely no meaning and can be interpreted any way you like

But the rules we all agree on are that we are all going to take them seriously

So that 's the one thing that nobody questions

Nobody questions the importance of the by-election

Everybody questions the significance of the results

Ah but they do mean one thing don't they because they actually influence the way in which parties behave

I doubt I doubt whether they do very much

I mean governments just lose by-elections all the time don't they

They they always have

Not invari they they

they do a lot

But I mean there is another one coming up in in Monmouth  uhm which is a Tory seat held by by uhm nine thousand votes

That people say means they won't have a June election or whatever

or perhaps they 'll have that in June

But it does actually influence the way in which the Government behaves

Well the Tories will lose that one

I mean there 's no question about that

Oh it 's like throwing the chicken bones

You throw the chicken bones

but then whichever way they land you interpret that as meaning that you 're going to do what you were going to do in the first place

Dafydd Elis-Thomas for a party of course like Plaid Cymru by-elections are a chance in the first place to get some decent publicity in the second place to to make an impact

Uh do you enjoy them 

Uh well do you want me to tell you the truth 

I actually I actually I don't  uh because they 're they 're a a t t trial uh an ordeal

they require a lot of hard work

they require getting up very early in the morning for press conferences talking reasonably with the press over coffee and croissants and everything else that one has in Neath for breakfast and then uh spending the rest of the day walking around with with with candidates

Actually this time it was a nice candidate

Uh we had a nice discussion about uh various aspects of the medical profession because he 's a consultant uh paediatrician

But outside of that I I I think they 're a very bizarre way of uh of of spending three weeks

Yes

Don't go that far



Do you ever have not nice candidates

Uhm I can remember a few but not recently 

One of the great things about by-elections though I think particularly for those who live in them the constituency Terry Hawkes is of course this extra bit of power that they give to a voter

It it 's a real treat isn't it

And I think I think that 's been in evidence here

I think the the vote for for Plaid Cymru is really a lot of Labour voters who are who are who are uh trying to send a message to uh the dreaded Neil Kinnock

I ca I can't take Matthew 's point that uh that by-elections have no meaning

Everything has meaning even these Greek dramas that he goes on about

But uh I think there 's a great deal of meaning in this one

Well I I don't want to analyse the Neath by-election which has been done pretty exhaustively uh uh you know

And we can we can perhaps leave aside whether they mean anything or not

I think I think they do influence how people act

But I uh to come back to the voters one of the things is I it seems to me that politicians Terry underestimate the voters

and they are uh they turn out in by-elections to be quite sophisticated in the way in which they uh act

Well they are now

Yes

And I think this is something that uh this is one of the benefits of democracy and a and a good education system

If we had one they 'd be even more sophisticated

Dafydd Elis-Thomas do you think that

I mean you you don't make great converts

but people do like to vote in the way that gives the sometimes gives the maximum impact to that little bit of power they 're given for a moment

Well this assumes that elections are held for the benefit of voters 

Uh uh and I think that 's a very serious question that we ought to ask ourselves

I think by-elections are mainly held now in the interest of tourism because they 're usually held out of season and they mean that the hotels in various towns such as the wonderful Castle Hotel in Neath

And I would like to thank all the staff there for their great kindness to me if they happen to be listening in to this sophisticated programme

Uh and uh as I say that 's the main reason for for for for holding these by-elections

And in Neath of course you have not only the Castle Hotel but also the Ambassador Hotel and the Diplomat Hotel

Now I didn't know there were any accredited ambassadors or diplomats in Neath

but there might be from now on

Yes

Not yet not yet

Yes

They 're they 're certainly in the interests of the tourist trade

They 're in the interests of all the commentators and the press who go there and uh claim generous expenses in doing so

The voters I think just have an opportunity to stick two fingers up to whoever seems to be on top at the moment

so you can call it sophisticated

You can

Why why are these two being so patronising I wonder

I mean why when the the by-election seems

Well because they 've both been elected in th uh

Matthew in the past

and uh Dafydd th uh is going to cease being uh seeking election

Well i i it 's it 's had a terrible effect on them in that case

I mean a b a by-election is a product of democracy

That 's what it 's for

that 's what it 's all about

If we didn't have a by-election uh uhm uh constituencies wouldn't be represented in Parliament

Well that 's what you think

Well this this

Yes

This assumes that uh the present electoral process in the United Kingdom has something to do with democracy

That 's a very big question indeed

Oh well I 'm not going down that road

I 'm I 'm def I 'm definitely not going down that road today because we 've got to get finished by Christmas

Uh one of the great things of course in of about by-elections in political history is that they all or many of them are c held to be stupendously significant

and names like  O Orpington Hillhead the the  Carmarthen at Carmarthen and Hamilton in the nineteen sixties

yes cam uh uh in the nineteen sixties

I certainly was

Uhm

but of course the at the time uh everybody said

this is it the

politics has changed for ever

But Dafydd it isn't changed for ever is it

and everything goes back to how it was before

Well it was it 's Hawkes who started it

All right

Camarthen Carmarthen

I thought you 'd say that

No it d no it did change

But nothing changes for ever but things are always changing

I 'm sure that Terry Hawkes would agree with this

Uh and what you have you you don't have earthquake changes or revolutionary kinds of changes because we are living of course within a decaying political culture

What you have is uh small changes which are brought about by shifts

And certainly in the context of not that I want to make this point particularly

but in the context of Welsh Welsh or Scottish po thank you in the context of Welsh or Scottish politics the

the drive towards the dreaded devolution uhm as uh no doubt some would describe it ha is always accentuated by these by-elections

Well five minutes in most cases

Uhm uhm

But you 're going to

Oh I really wonder about the significance of these things

W we go straight back after the by-election almost always to virtually exactly the same result as as was achieved in that constituency at the last general election when you get to the next  general election

The reason by-elections are given this great significance is that whichever by-elections occur before a general election are always seen as having been the pointers

They will be defined as having been the pointers

But it 's really quite arbitrary which by-elections they are

Well Terence Hawkes as a professor a university professor you must disagree totally with John Major s who says common sense is the crucial thing not these wretched degrees

Well the trouble with common sense is that it it 's it 's not common and it 's often not very sensible either

Uh common sense is is always the uh the fall-back position of the reactionary

It 's it says that what we know and what we do is is perfectly OK and we never have to examine our first principles

But in fact common sense isn't common it it

it has to be uh constructed and it uf often isn't sense

I can remember when common sense said that for instance women were weaker than men

women shouldn't wear trousers

women should earn less money than men

That was common sense for a long long time

Common sense is something we invent and uh it 's usually something we invent to stop us from the uh uh chore of having to think about life

But I suppose that Mr Major 's point is that having a degree in say English Literature or  uh Greek and Latin whatever uh uh only fits you uh and only says something about your ability in that area and not in the wider areas of life in which pe uh we need to achieve things

Uhm

Well you might say in if he does think that he he 's condemning most of the previous Tory party leaders it seems to me who 've had degrees in all sorts of unlikely things even economics that pseudo-science

Well he 's not saying that uh uh if you 've been to university you 're no good

What he 's saying is that whether or not you 've been to university doesn't make very much difference to whether you 're any good or not

I mean that was a splendid diatribe against common sense

and I agree with it

but whatever it is that 's better than common sense is not necessarily to be found in the universities

That 's John Major 's point

Yes

You know what I think what I think is really going on here is something quite complex

Uhm there 's been a campaign in the press to denigrate Neil Kinnock

Uh part of that campaign has been to say Neil Kinnock uh isn't very bright isn't very intelligent

He went to this awful down-market university which isn't either Oxford or Cambridge

And the truth is that if Neil Kinnock uh were to become Prime Minister he 'd be the first Prime Minister in British history who if they 'd been to a university has been to any university other than Oxford or Cambridge

And that 's a shameful thing

That 's a horrific uhm element of our history

Uh John Major is one of those people who 's never been to university at all and has become Prime Minister

There are plenty of those Winston Churchill uh uh Lloyd George  Jim Callaghan 

The the point the Tories seem to be making is that anything is better than going to the sort of university that most graduates go to and if you can't go to Oxford and Cambridge the best thing to do is not to go anywhere

Well Jim Jim Jim Jim Ca Jim Callaghan uhm Ramsay McDonald

University of life there all right

Dafydd Elis-Thomas

Dr Dafydd Elis-Thomas

Another one with uh degrees which Mr Major doesn't think much of

Do you accept common sense is the crucial thing

Well Terry 's just given me a very common sense reason for hoping that Neil Kinnock will become Prime Minister

It 's the first good reason I 've discovered which is that he is a graduate of the University of Wales and therefore would be the first Prime Minister to be the graduate of our great university

But I think the th th

Well of any university other than Oxford or Cambridge

Yes yeah

Yes of course

Well ou our next witness is Judith Dawson who 's a principal senior social worker in Nottinghamshire

She 's been involved in some appalling sexual abuse cases there and also in controversial allegations of ritualised satanic abuse uh which have been contested by the police and others

Uhm Ju Judith clearly you weren't involved in the McGowan case and can't talk about it in detail

and we wouldn't want you to

but doesn't it illustrate one of the principal difficulties and problems that that parents are to an extent p put on trial but really unable to contest uh or discover and contest the evidence that 's being amassed against them by social workers wh who really aren't judges 

That 's a very real problem for us and it 's one that that worries me and worries social workers in our authority

The dilemma we have is that  as a general rule we 're committed to uh sharing information with parents working in partnership with them

That 's the framework of the law

That 's what we have to do

And ninety per cent of the cases that that works very well even works in in ninety per cent of of child abuse cases where you 're dealing with a problem that 's probably  uhm arisen through various types of stress and that you know you intervene child isn't removed  uh most of the cases we deal with  children aren't removed and the problem is resolved through putting in services and what have you 

However that leaves you with the the small percentage of cases where you 're trying to work in partnership with people who are abusing their children who very clearly are abusing their children who are being uh who are denying it who are being secretive  and uh where you can't mount enough evidence because it 's such a secretive and and hidden kind of activity  to actually confront the situation openly with the parent

Janet Daley your witness 

Would you agree though that children who are wrenched traumatically from their parents would not only be terrified but they 'd also be very suggestible and inclined to say whatever they thought their interrogators wanted to hear 

If you put it that way well well of course

Uhm I have to say that uh in my authority uh I 've got very little experience of that scenario that you 're describing

Since January in our authority  we 've had six hundred referrals of abuse from members of the public other professions

That is not from social workers

Social workers haven't been proactive and intervened

We 've had referrals from members of the public and other professions

That is the community are worried about six hundred children 

And we 've responded

Now I looked at the figures yesterday

In sixty-seven per cent of those cases we 've been able to res reassure members of the public

So that means over two thirds we 've been able to say well

you were right to be concerned

but we 've had a look at it

and we don't feel there 's any need to take any action

Now that leaves us with the the the difficult percentage that 's left

And out of those I think it 's something like a quarter where we 're actually left with serious concerns that we feel we need to do something about 

Can I ask about the culture what you might call the culture of the profession because all professions do have a ka kind of in inbred culture to some extent

D do you feel I 've been looking quite carefully at social work training over the last year or so

do you feel that the political orientation particularly of the the the theory the sociological aspect of social work training predisposes social workers to distrust the nuclear family generally to find it to think of it as being a repressive institution in itself

Well again uhm of course there are people who feel that

In in social work as there are in any any kind of profession there will be people with different positions

But you have to remember that social workers are acting uh within the framework of the law

The law is actually telling us because it 's provided such a framework that there are situations within families where we do need to be concerned and that we need to take some some action

Professor Roger Scruton

Yes I wonder whether to take up Jane Daley 's point whether you  are convinced that the kind of training given to social workers which involves the learning a lot of this sociological theory  and so on is the right training

Obviously we I think we 'd all agree that this is a very difficult job 

and it 's perhaps a necessary job

but in the past it was very often done by uh priests or or rabbis indeed uhm like my neighbour here

And should it not be perhaps uh made more open to people of that kind of uh training rather than being exclusively the preserve of the uh sociological  and and thinking classes so to speak

Uhm

Uhm

Right

Right OK

Well uhm I can only speak for my own training  which uh was twenty years ago

And I have to say that the the the people who are dealing with the complex cases in in Nottinghamshire at least are people who are of my kind of generation

And uh the amount of uh sociology in my own training was very limited

I mean I think I think it was too limited 

However uhm as far as other people uh playing a part in this I 'm completely committed to uhm the whole community trying to help us with with these kinds of problems

Now social workers haven't got the answers

And indeed it 's too complex it

it 's too much of a moral maze to leave it with with one profession which is why  we simply have responsibility to act in terms of bringing the problem in front of the courts in front of the other disciplines  and asking them to help us form a view

Uhm

So really you 're saying it 's a legal question f first and foremost

Absolutely

Judith I don't want to uh t tar you with other people 's uh difficulties

I me me you 're obviously very reasonable and and and so on

But b but those cases that do  hit the headlines

And maybe the media plays a part in all this

I don't know

But of those cases that do hit the headlines like Cleveland uhm less so Cleveland but Rochdale certainly and uh Orkney it appears are are you know when they 're judicially examined betrays a picture of social workers as incompetent as incapable of taking notes of interviews incapable of using equipment incapable even of reading the Cleveland Report when they 're dealing with what is bound to be an extre an obviously controversial case of a similar kind

Uhm  yes

Uhm  yes

Uhm

Uhm

And not only incompetent but also if you 'll forgive my saying so

and you clearly are not representing this kind of view

but also very arrogant

I mean you are saying very reasonably that the whole community should play a role in this

but the picture that we 're getting of a great many social workers is of extraordinary uhm extraordinary arrogance and and self-confidence about their own ability to make judgements



Well you know where are you getting this this picture

You 're getting it from uh from the media

I can't really comment on on Orkney and and Rochdale except to say

it 's very important to remember that the evidence wasn't heard in Orkney that uh

and the other thing to remember is of course that uhm there 's still a criminal case which is being considered uh by the Crown Office in Scotland

So I think we mustn't make too many early judgements about the Orkney situation

A and everyone agrees I think that th the kind of phenomena phenomenon that uh  they were apparently looking at is is a new one it 's

it 's complicated and uh we will make mistakes







OK

I think that there 's going to be incompetence in every profession

There are incompetent judges

That doesn't mean they they you know the uh the judicial system is taken away from them

There are incompetent doctors

People get the wrong injections have the wrong leg amputated 

We don't  you know 

But  but let 's all look at that

Social workers last year were arguing for three years '  training all right rather than the two years that they currently get

Most of them are graduates plus two years

We 're arguing for three

Department of Health felt that they couldn't support that

they didn't have the resources

You know everybody agrees that uhm the answer is to to keep  putting in more resources for training and and look at the criticisms that have been made about us

There are incompetent rabbis perhaps

Dare we suggest that



Sorry Judith

Uhm Judith  J Judith thanks very much indeed for coming in and giving evidence to us

Our next witness is Sue Amphlett who in nineteen eighty-five set up the support group PAIN which stands for Parents Against Injustice

An injustice she feels was done to her when her daughter was placed on the at risk register

She lived under the constant threat of her daughter being taken into care until it was eventually discovered her daughter 's injuries came from brittle bone disease uh not parental abuse

Uhm Sue have you got no no sympathy for social workers who  as they often say are damned if they do and damned if they don't in this sort of case

Uh uh certainly 

I wouldn't like to do their job particularly in the current climate 

Uhm however what we say is that it is never one individual agency or one person that is responsible if a child is abused and left at home or taken into care and hasn't been abused

It is the system that is responsible

And how competent do you think that system is 

I think the procedures and practices that have been laid down by some thirty-six child death inquiries the Cleveland Enquiry Report  the Department of Health Working Together Guidelines are very good

Sadly what is happening is that they 're not being put into practice

Edward Pearce your witness 

First of all Mrs Amphlett e we have the problem of when it goes wrong and somebody like yourself or Mr McGowan is hung up by their thumbs and given a terrible time in circumstances of perfect innocence 

At the other end of the scale we have the cases where  with uh the Jasmine Beckford case a so social worker leans towards the parent  tries to see it from their point of view and the parent turns out to be somebody quite murderous 

And they are  suitably damned if they have intervened wrongly

they are suitably damned if they have held back  wrongly

Is it individuals getting it wrong 

Is it the fact that there is no  quick way out of a false charge the equivalent of going to a judge in chambers in uh a civil action

Would you like to see some procedural change that allows the innocent person like Mr McGowan say to get to a high point of appeal early and have the whole thing uh wiped out

Is this a question or a speech

Sorry it 's a long question

I think I think in the first instance it 's unfortunate that you picked on the Jasmine Beckford story because of course the local authority did have parental rights in that instance

They had decided the child was abused

They returned the child home

But they failed to act as parents because they didn't actually see the child

So it was quite right in that instance that they should have been damned because they had taken action

They decided the child was at risk

And if you look at most of the other child death inquiries the the same that is exactly the same

Most of the children were already known to the authorities

In the States for example they 're quoting that sixty-seven per cent of cases investigated are deemed unfounded after investigation which is an interesting figure that Judith picked up in Nottingham

Sixty-seven tup per cent of the cases they investigated they could go back to the people who raised the the query and say

look

there isn't a problem

I would turn that round the other way and say

that is sixty-seven per cent of people getting caught up who have gone through a traumatic investigation which traumatises parents traumatises children and ends up with system-abused children

As the newcomer Professor Scruton briefly before you hear the witnesses where do you stand 

It seems to me that there is a certain kind of journalist who regards all power as a conspiracy and his uh his du prime duty as that of exposing it

And in times of war such journalists I think can be a danger

Edward Pearce 

The only things which could be properly suppressed in war are compass bearings and the hour of assault

All talk of sustaining morale in a war which is not one of national defence is humbug and a very popular kind of humbug

Janet Daley

I feel that before a war is declared there has to be absolute maximum possibility for discussion in a democratic society to make sure that there is a will to proceed

And I think that after it 's completed there has to be maximum discussion to learn as much as possible from the experience

But during the war there seems to me an absolutely sound justification for controlling information

Rabbi Hugo Gryn



Now I wondered why you were on the panel Hugo and now I know



Great

Initial positions established

Let 's call our first witness

General Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley is a former Commander-in-Chief Northern Europe and a ubiquitous television pundit

Not quite a foot in both camps I think 

Uh uh General Lawrence of Arabia it was who said  that the press uh

and there was no T V then of course

the press was the greatest weapon in the armoury of the modern military commander

Is that why generals try so hard to manipulate the media

I don't know that they 're they 're manipulating the media in quite the way I guess that that that question uh puts

Uhm the p prime thing that any commander in the field has in his mind is dealing with the operations

It 's very difficult for you to understand how that is pressing upon him the whole time

Now  uh the media uh is a factor of getting on with the operation uh making the best of things if things go badly or even salving something but it is a subsidiary interest in his mind

He ought to have a good P R man

and he ought to have a chief of staff who uh is aware of the press and so on

but it is not continually with him day in day out hour in hour out in the way that I believe many of you imagine

Edward Pearce your witness

General do you recognise a a difference between proclaimed war all broken lances and gallantry and the sound of horses ' hooves and the actuality of war with faces blown off and guts spilt and  people burnt from nape to heel 

I 've spent forty-two years of my life as a soldier uhm starting with th the beginning of the Second World War and ranging through different wars like the Korean War and so on

This is not a uh a set of war stories for you

but it 's simply to say that I have seen many of my friends let alone many other luckless people in uh civilians uhm defenceless people on the battlefield killed beside the enemy uhm

And anybody who thinks that there is great glory in war as such uh is off his head

On the other hand I have to say that the war does bring out in people extraordinary nobility uh and that is something which uh is very moving and memorable

But when the hideous things happen happen through pure inadvertence like the bombing of a shelter 

and the uh Spanish journalist Alfonso Rocco looked inside that shelter and described the people as being strangely sh strangely uh shrunk and looking rather like barbecued chickens

it was truly horrible

There were pictures of that

Those pictures never appeared in the west

Should we not have seen the actuality of war

Uhm it depends what you want to do with those pictures

Uhm I certainly believe that the event should have been reported

If you want uh to make sure that everybody sees the real horror of war why just uhm light on that one

There are many other pictures that are could have been shown

War as you rightly said is a very nasty business

It 's about killing people uh during the operational phase uh and killing them by any means

And when you 're for example uhm actually fighting yourself you don't worry about the ethics of it

You 're concerned to keep going

Sure but we didn't

Although there are many other things that could have been shown we didn't show that and we didn't show them

There was a notable absence of true pictures of the atrocity of war until the famous picture in the Observer taken by Kenny Jackezni which showed the mud-caked face that had been human flesh uh of a a Iraqi soldier looking out of a tank turret

Now in practice there was censorship was there not by which it was I I a suggested and b very readily and compliantly agreed that nothing that might uh disturb the patriotic mood over the conflicts should be allowed to appear on patriotic  newspapers

Surely that is wrong

All right

I well uh that 's a matter of opinion

Uhm I personally don't think that is wrong

If a nation has embarked on war uhm although you should not withhold information the fact of the matter is you don't want to continually bombard 'em with material which will make people uh in a civilized society begin to have doubts to falter and so on and fall away from support of the main aim

But if they are for war shouldn't it not be for all the consequences of war

Should they not be able to make the moral decision

Unless we do this flows from it

Sorr uh 

I I I think we 've reached a point there

A a are you not saying General that even the language whi which the military used the taking out of assets and collateral damage and so on is i i i is really an effort to to to to gloss over the real consequences of war which might which which might undermine public support for the generals 



Yes I think it was overdone

I think there 's been uhm a a a tendency too great a tendency in this matter to go in for that sort of language

And it 's been brought about by one phenomenon and that is the daily press conference which is going to accompany the news pictures coming out uhm which has sharpened the whole uh focus a and awareness of the military hierarchy as to what is going on

Absolutely right

I I and and we should cut back on that type of language

Hugo



Well ju let 's get away a a as I think you 're trying to do from uhm uh you 're seeking to do from just purely a matter of uhm picture representation of dead bodies 

Most certainly I mean

if I were a commander in uh chief in the field I would not hesitate to use the press if necessary in order to carry through a deception programme

No

It happens to be a facility

Certainly I would not be so foolish to regard it as a piece of my equipment because it 's plainly not under my control

But to the extent that it is a facility uhm I would most certainly not hesitate to use it in uh in in aid of deception as was the case in my judgement by General Schwarzkopf in the preparation of his splendid deception programme

Janet Daley

Uhm you 're quite I I think deliberately avoiding the notion of manipulation which I think

I think there is a strong case for avoiding that term because there has to be a distinction made between the selection of information which is conveyed which the military in inevitably will do in fact anyone has to do in the presentation of any kind of complex situation and manipulation which implies that you are attempting to use the media uh to present a particular deceitful picture

Uh do you not feel that to some extent the vocabulary of this the description of this war was dictated by the American authorities who have uh rather a penchant for that kind of technological and obscurantist vocabulary in al a lot of spheres not just the military one

I 'm afraid that is true

And it 's come about uhm through Vietnam and in parallel with that the enormous growth of immediate reporting

Uh the Americans were certainly much more aware of their needs and they had a very much tougher press corps to deal with which I may say did not share the aims of the American public

I don't know if you read the article in Wall Street Journal which pointed out that the public did not expect to have a right to know everything uh and and which shook a number of American journalists n notably C N N

Here too actually

Here too

Ha General c a last question to you

Uh d do you not 

would you not a admit that the generals were very wary about showing pictures or or giving details of things that might introduce the full horror of war

I remember for instance the video that was shown of the lorry going across the bridge

You know the luckiest lorry and driver in Iraq

Well that evening uh th there was a video here in the in the War Office for only selected military corres correspondents showing uh the lorry that wasn't lucky  uh which was not shown to people

There was a delib deliberate effort to make it appear surgical and almost consequence free uh in order that that public opinion at home should not should not be eroded

Uh uh uh uh

Uh uh

I think you 're putting that in too simplistic a form

The fact is that uh uh it is right in my judgement not to flood the home market uh with or any other international market with news of the horrors of war the graphic uh pictures and so on

But that does not mean to say that one should withhold all information about it

I see no reason to do that

General thank you thank you very much indeed

Uh General Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley

Our next witness is uh one of the country 's leading left-wing journalists

Paul Foot is no mere polemicist but an investigative reporter with a distinguished record of fighting injustice and uncovering corruption

Uh Paul were you were you proud of the way your fellow journalists covered the war

Not at all

No

I thought we had far too many journalists in battle dress

In fact they had actually to dress up in battle battle dress which I thought was symbolic of uh the way they had to cov uh to cover the war

Were their ideas dressed up in battle dress

I thought they were

Yes

I thought most of the journalists that went out there were uh uh minded uh by army teams

They were called media response teams which I thought was an interesting new development in which journalists were really carried around and shown what to report and told what to report effectively

I think most of the stuff that came out of the Gulf with some very honourable exceptions by the way

and I think we should be proud of the exceptions as proud of the exceptions as we are shocked and shamed uh at the general

but I think in general the reporting of the war was really just battle dress reporting

Professor Roger Scruton your witness

Uhm Mr Foot do you think that a journalist has any special duty in times of war towards his country or is it his duty the same as it is on ordinary day to day occasions

No

I think really all the talk a about country is a lot of rubbish

And what uh Janet Daley was saying right at the beginning of the programme

I thought when she said

you have to have the maximum debate before the war

but when the war takes place we have uh we have to close ranks and come behind the Government

I mean that really is a ridiculous distinction

In the in

It 's not what I said actually

Well something like that

You said after after the war 's declared we should uh that information should be controlled

I I don't see that at all

I I don't think we have responsibility to a country

A country may be wrong and often is wrong

Germany in nineteen thirty-nine was wrong

You know you have to be uh you have to assess what the the a journalist has a job to assess the situation but above all to report the situation

You you do have a responsibility to have your own views

That 's quite clear

But equally you have a responsibility to the facts that you see before you

And you have to blend those two

You can't tell lies just because you have particular views

I was against the Gulf War absolutely hundred per cent against it

I still am a hundred per cent against it uh but I don't think that wou would give me any excuse to report something wrongly

Uh and equally I think that applies to what the Government position is or what the military position is

Vernon everybody knows you as Tod

Why 's that

Yes 

I walk with my feet turned inwards

and I if I fall over I toddle 

and so it just stuck

That 's established that

Uh and you Bryden are known as Jack aren't you

That 's right

Well everybody knows me as Jack so that 's the end of my history

Well turning to you Tod Handley

Uhm w w what first made you interested in music of this particular period 

Well in fact I was reading a book uh called Musical Trends in the Twentieth Century by Norman Demuth

He used to be a professor at the Academy

And there were mention of names that I didn't know

I knew my Wagner and my Beethoven and my Brahms very well but uh I saw that there were a great number of British composers that I hadn't heard of

And I went to the local library and literally started to read this stuff

And what first turned you on Jack

Well many years ago as an assistant conductor at  and the B B C in Glasgow a part of the brief was to do a se quite a lot of what we would then call the new music

And I came across various names I mean English as well as Scottish all of which had an interest in new music

But really what 's happened with my sort of history is when I met uh did a little recording with Chandos Records uhm and the Ulster orchestra who was conducting there came up with enough money to do their first record and they got Chandos interested

It was then that uh I fell in love with music like Hamilton Harty and a bit of Stanford

and the Arn the Arnold Bax Saga became something quite uh excellent

Well that 's a day we certainly want to come back to a bit later

But if we could just for a moment concentrate on the latter years of the nineteenth century

How true was this terrible saying about the land without music

Particularly the Germans came out with it so I hear

I don't know how they got the idea

We did their music rather proud didn't we for a few hundred years

Uhm I think it 's a it 's quite rubbish

What it is is that we are bad exporters of our own genius

Would you say that Jack

I would probably agree with that

I think even today there 's still an element around isn't there that the grass is greener on the other side of the fence sort of thing

Mm

Yeah

Well I suppose there is

But wasn't it true at that time that a great many British composers composed in a continental vein I mean following Brahms or  whatever

Yeah

Well I think those influences were were fairly obvious

And and And later on I think the influence of French music was quite uh supreme

Yes

But dragging you back again to the slightly earlier years

Uh th around the end of the century it was eighteen ninety-nine wasn't it Elgar came along with the Enigma Variations

And that was a big success in Germany

Yes

Well I think all over the world

Uh the reference in Toscanini 's letters u of waiting to see what uh Mr Elgar 's Variations are going to be like 

Uh so obviously it was a success

But  what has amazed me about a lot of Elgar 's music is that since then I don't think uh a great deal of his music 's played in Germany uh which I think is a great pity

I 'm not aware that the symphonies are certainly overplayed and I think they 're both masterpieces although they get many performances elsewhere

That 's right

But at that particular time Enigma must have woken up the Germans to some extent to the fact that there was such a thing as British music and it was worth listening to

Oh yes

And prepared the way for uhm uh Gerontius when it made its great success later in Germany

But d' you know a

around that time already though we tend not to think of it in quite the same way Delius was having quite a success in Germany

We seem to forget that

It was round the turn of the century

Mm 

But in fact you 've both recorded the Enigma Variations and both with the with the London Philharmonic Orchestra

But uh let 's see

Watch Which one are we going to have

That 's the problem

Have Jack 's it 's

it 's more recent so it would be a better better recording level

Very decent of you

Right

Bryden Thomson conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra 

Well now let 's move beyond Elgar into the early years of the twentieth century 

And who were the composers really who were around at that time that we 've uh perhaps forgotten a a good deal about

Tod

I suppose there must have been a a number of performances of works of Parry and Stanford who we look upon now quite rightly as people who guided a a later generation

For instance it when we were recording Stanford 's Second Piano Concerto I was surprised to see that it had been uhm played in most parts of the world

It was quite a popular work in its time

And we tend to forget whole areas of a composer 's life

And I think it 's particularly happened to those uh two men

Do You admire th the Parry and Stanford pieces 

I do indeed

I haven't uh uh I 've done all the Stanford rhapsodies for example in concert and B B C broadcasts and things like that

And I think he he Stanford was a v very fine influence I think on many other younger composers who were coming along

The Royal College of Music seems to have been a tremendous powerhouse as it were of inspiration doesn't it of at that time

Yes

That 's right

Well that 's V Vaughan Williams and and Holst and John Ireland all going there as students

That must have been a seething time

Of course on the other side of the park uh was Arnold Bax in the Academy

I remember I remember Boult once saying to me because he wasn't particularly fond of Bax and I always have been since my youth

ah yes

in the Academy they taught them to use more pencil but in the College more rubber 

Well let 's talk about Arnold Bax because the name 's already come up in our conversation uhm and uh he 's obviously a a very important figure and both of you have recorded quite a good deal of music by by Bax

Where did he look for his sources of of inspiration

You 've already said the French were very important to him but

but he also had a another kind of interest didn't he

 

Uhm

Well he had this uh uh strange drawing attraction to Ireland

He sh He said what was it that the Celt in him stood revealed when he when he saw some particular uh uh landscape or something

or

No no

That was when he read the first uh words of Yeats

The Celt in me stood revealed

But I think uh uh regardless of his influences I think that he is the most neglected of that uh number of composers around the turn of the century

I think he 's the man who really ought to be on every programme don't you Jack

Yes

And a man of of prodigious output

I mean there are

I don't know what 's still lying in the attic or the cellar that could still be played or recorded

Uh I have friends in Dublin whose father was John Larshey the professor of music at University College Dublin who personally knew Bax who he used to go and see in Bray in just outside of Dublin and places like that adje

uh uh

Again talking of

the man said he was the most amazing pianist

He could play his full scores on the piano you know

And one must also remember that uh the same Arnold Bax has written poetry and I think plays under the pseudonym of Dermot O'Brien

Oh terrific

Yes

Dermot O'Byrne

Oh Dermot O'Byrne 

But

And of course he was also a Master of The King 's Music three times

and that 's yet another aspect to his extraordinary 

Byrne yes

Certainly was 

Yes

He was a super-educated man  and uh this prodigious pianism that he had

There 's a great story that once uhm at a meeting in London uhm D'Indy came with his new symphony yes yeah with his Symphony on a French Mountain Song in manuscript

And everybody said

oh after dinner we 're looking forward to hearing this

And D'Indy said

oh prrr

but it 's ridiculous

I can't play it

And they said

get young Bax

And Bax read this brand new score at sight with the composer turning over for him 

Mm

Mm

 Vincent D'Indy 

Fascinating isn't it

Well we 've got a great range now thanks to both of you of of Bax 's music to choose from on record

There 's a piece here called Spring Fire which takes my interest I must say

What 's that about Tod

Yeah

Well it 's a wonderful uh story uh

And that is that he was commissioned by the Norwich and Norfolk Triennial Festival in nineteen thirteen to write an orchestral work

He wrote Spring Fire

This was for the nineteen fourteen festival

That didn't come about because of the war

And it was never played so Bax died without hearing it 

We revived it by producing it at the N Norwich and Norfolk Triennial Festival in nineteen eighty-five exactly seventy-one years late 

Uh it 's a very very beautiful work

and it has uh the influences that Jack was talking about of the French orchestration but still nevertheless could only have been Bax

Uhm

That 's just a little of Spring Fire by Arnold Bax

The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Vernon Handley

A work written in nineteen thirteen just before the First World War

Was the First World War a great divide do you think in British music 

A most talented composer who wrote very little and suffered during the fourteen eighteen war was George Butterworth

And uh that marvellous tone poem Shropshire Lad I think shows what might have come from a a most talented man

It was It was a dividing line in that particular way I think

It It almost st stopped Ivor Gurney as well didn't it the the songwriter

Uhm

That 's right of course

He suffered great mental distress didn't he after the war

Yeah

But there was

I I remember reading in his letters uhm that he was looking forward to hearing Vaughan Williams 's Sea Symphony again

So already uh the these names that we now think of as great men they 'd started to establish themselves

You mentioned Hamilton Harty

was he important at that time

That 's right

One he was a an absolutely first-rate orchestral conductor

Everybody says that

Anyone who worked with him some of the older men I 've spoken to in years gone by say that he was a fantastic man

He He 's written some very good music although not a large output

He 's a very fine composer

And he was a superb accompanist at the piano another great keyboard man like Arnold Bax was

There was One other name I wanted to to throw in was Gerald Finzi  because I think the Clarinet Concerto is the most amazing piece

Fantastic music

Mm

Yes

Thi This is a world-class piece isn't it

This is one of the things that that worries me of course and

and fortunately now that wh well we both tour around abroad it 's possible to gauge the impact of British music on foreign audiences and foreign orchestras

And I 'm very glad to say they all love it and they all play it well

I 've actually done the Finzi Clarinet Concerto in Helsinki with a young uh Finnish player who uh understood it perfectly played it superbly

So the our music is exportable

It is universal three-or-four-words

Absolutely

But wh

What about audiences here

I mean the the fact is you 've been fortunate enough to be able to record

We 've been fortunate enough to have your recordings of these pieces produced by Chandos and and and one or two other companies

But what about concerts

I mean do concert audiences here want this kind of music

Well I personally have been involved in some Bax symphonies in public which g had very good audiences

I would love to see more of it happening

And I think what happens is with a lot of the managements of the orchestral societies they 're a little bit wary you see that that because the public might not know the music that they might not turn up in droves

And I think the gamble is worth it quite frankly

That 's right

Yeah

There are There are two There are two things at work aren't there

There 's a definite division between doing it in London and elsewhere

You can get a great deal of this music on elsewhere

Let 's take Lord Scarman 's first  recommendation first 

He says that there should not be one national police force 

Sir John Wheeler Conservative M P Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee you 've rather tended towards supporting a national force in the past

You 've called the current structure of policing a Heath Robinson structure

Where do you stand now 

I certainly believe that the police system in the United Kingdom and in England and Wales should be nationally organised but I also believe that uh many of its services should be locally delivered 

In other words if you live in the county town of Buckingham your chief of police is the local chief inspector or superintendent not the Chief Constable of the Thames Valley Constabulary somewhere in in a manor house the other side of Oxford but your local uh senior police officer

And the interface that is occurring between the public and the local police through the uh Police Consultative Committees is very much the way forward in delivering local accountability

But as far as the chief constables are concerned you would replace approximately fifty of them in Britain with one who was the Chief Constable of the National Police Force

Uh no

I would not

Uh uh whilst I would nationally fund the system and it 's ninety per cent funded from the Exchequer now we must recognise that I would retain the office of Chief Constable

And there is merit in retaining local commands

After all uh chief constables innovate they produce ideas and I want to preserve the best of that innovation because I think it helps support our style of policing structure

David Owen President of the Association of Chief Police Officers this month you talked about a hidden agenda which you suspected the Government had of moving towards a national police force

Uh are you satisfied that the Home Secretary has now ruled that out when he said he wasn't going to do it this Parliament or next

Indeed I am

He in fact addressed the Association of Chief Police Officers at Chester and gave a very clear and uhm unequivocal statement that he saw no reason to change the present structure which he believed worked well

What have you got against a national police force

I think basically what one is concerned about is what would what the concerns were way back in eighteen twenty-nine when we were first formed that we would end up being nothing more nothing less than an arm of the State

And I think that would be a very reprehensible situation and it 's certainly in my view the last thing that the British public would want

And listening to what Sir John Wheeler says and accepting that of course the money 's ninety per cent of it does come from central government by one way or another the system that he seems to be advocating would in fact take away one leg of the tripartite system

And I think the strength of the police authorities is something which is to be applauded

And it may well be that the Chief Constable is seen as Lord Scarman says to have absolute power

The reality is of course that there are checks and balances on this so called absolute power in respect of his responsibilities under the law and more importantly to his police authority that if he starts going off on a frolic of his own the police authority will soon want to know precisely the justification for a certain course of action

and indeed rightly so

Roy Hattersley if you were not Shadow but actual Home Secretary would you change the structure of the police forces in a national direction

Certainly not

Uhm I 'd want to see what Lord Scarman has called regional police forces

and I 'd want to see them for reasons which are related as I think they are in Lord Scarman 's mind to the accountability of those police forces

A national police force is either responsible to the Government which is undesirable or responsible to nobody which is almost as undesirable perhaps even more undesirable

The only way you can make police forces genuinely accountable to the people they serve is by having a regional structure and police committees which are the police authority for that area

And I believe as well as bringing a sense of democracy that 's essential to good policing

One of the reasons that the police and public did become alienated in the eighties was I believe the changes in the accountability which moved power away from the elected watch committees more and more  to the chief police officer or to some amorphous authority that the man and woman in the street was not sure of

People began to doubt if the police force was really theirs and unless that feeling 's abroad police and people won't work in cooperation and the crime rate will continue to rise

Robert McClelland for the Liberal Democrats 

I think that Lord Scarman was right when he said that our accountability for the police in this country was muddled and incomplete

We need accountability at several levels which reflect the actual functioning of the police

I don't agree with the view which was expressed by Sir John Wheeler that because at present ninety per cent of the financing of the police comes from central government something like ninety per cent of the control should be at the centre

I think in fact you should certainly transfer funding to the regions along the lines that Roy Hattersley perhaps has in mind but that you should go further and recognise that it is in the local community that most of the public is going to be aware of the functioning of the police and wishes to see proper accountability exercised

John Smith Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police 













What about this unique position that the Metropolitan Police has which is that it is not accountable to an elected body

it 's accountable to the Home Secretary as police authority

Should that as Lord Scarman has suggested be changed













Uh how will that work Roy Hattersley

Uhm the c accountability for the Metropolitan Police to Parliament to the Home Secretary is simply a fiction a legal fiction 

Uh what it amounts to is a half day 's debate once a year on a Friday morning

And it also amounts to the Home Secretary saying utterly reasonably when asked questions about the Metropolitan Police that he can't and won't deal with the way the Metropolitan Police is organised

It 's unreasonable to expect a senior Cabinet Minister to be involved with the operation of and supervision of the most uh complicated policing operation in the country 

Robert Reiner from the L S E











David Owen President of the Association of Chief Police Officers

uh ACPO as it 's called uh accountable to nobody has become a national organisation for police policy hasn't it

I wouldn't accept that ACPO is not specifically accountable to to nobody as to use your phrase

The reality of the situation is that ACPO of course sets its policies and advises Chief Constables to seek a degree of commonality each amongst the others so that you don't get Force A taking a particular line and Force B taking an opposite line

It 's not a policy-making body in terms of its accountability

It is the matter of the Chief Constable following that particular line

But I think it 's important to make the point that when one talks about the Home Office influence there are Home Office advices which are given to Chief Constables but really and truly the strength of the British police service is in its ability to adapt to change

And we have an ability to respond to the national to the internationalism of crime through the medium of regional crime squads

So we shouldn't say that just because we have a locally based and a locally accountable force that it can't respond

It can and does and does so very successfully as far as we see it

If you don't accept that ACPO is accountable to nobody who is it accountable to

Well it isn't accountable on the basis that it merely is a group of Chief Constables who sit down together to consider the new issues and and devise if you like systems of policing what is best in terms of a common policy

If that policy is then adopted by a Chief Constable it is he adopting that policy that is accountable for that policy that he adopts in his force area

John Alderson former member of the Association of Chief Police Officers how do you see the accountability of the force 

Well I agree with Lord Scarman that uh it is vague at the moment

It hasn't quite worked out as the last Royal Commission intended and Parliament uh tried to enact

Uh we have two strands of this discussion it seems to me at the moment

One is the professional or of the Chief Constables and the Deputy Commissioner and so on

and the other is the political argument 

Now the political argument is very interesting in as much it doesn't surprise me that Sir John Wheeler uh says

well things are OK as they are

We 're drifting towards a centralised authority

It 's centralisation by stealth

You don't have to be a reformer

You don't have to be a revolutionary

You can be an evolutionary because the thing is drifting your way

But this is damaging our principles and historic uh a a acceptance of democracy at a local level

The powerful instrument of the police to be centred here in Parliament is something that people have fought for throughout the ages

What we really need is the political argument to accept a strengthening of local democracy and the professionals in the police service to organise themselves so they can deal at international regional and local level

It calls for a whole new approach to policing

And particularly with my last point  Lord Scarman 's uh warning to us all that we live in an age of human rights sensitivity

That 's not only in our own country it 's throughout the world

It 's rising up

And the police in my view have to have their ethics grounded in an acceptance of their role to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms and our instruments of democratic government

That is the fundamental premise of a new police force which I think we need in this country and should move towards 

Andrew Puddephatt from Liberty the National Council for Civil Liberties do we need a new constitutional framework for the police 

Well I think we certainly need to s find ways of strengthening the accountability of the police

Uh at the moment under the Police Act they 're accountable essentially to the law

But in practice a a number of key decisions are made purely at the discretion of local police officers or in accordance with Home Office guidelines

So our own report published last week reveals for example a vast intelligence-gathering operation on the British public

Uh in Suffolk one in six members of the public are on police files

many of them are not suspected of any specific criminal offence

Now these kinds of decisions or the decisions of the Cleveland police to record suspected H I V AIDS carriers without any consultation with the people or any medical evidence are examples of the kinds of problems we have under current arrangements where the police are not directly accountable for a number of important infringements of people 's rights that take place

And I think Lord Scarman 's right to highlight the era of human rights and the fact that the police are the key institution in our society

Let 's now talk about the second area where Lord Scarman made recommendations the procedures for dealing with complaints against the police

He recommended a number of changes which would increase the independence of the Police Complaints Authority

Brigadier John Purnell Deputy Chairman of the Police Complaints Authority could you live with the changes that were suggested









Andrew Puddephatt from Liberty would those changes go far enough to establish your confidence in the police complaints procedures

They would certainly improve the situation substantially on on what exists at present

And we 'd very much welcome Lord Scarman 's suggestions

I think the other issue is the burden of proof in police disciplinary cases

At the moment it 's really beyond reasonable doubt and most public servants most workers in any industry are found guilty or innocent in disciplinary offences on the balance of probability

And I think that might make a change in the difference in the number of convictions of police officers accused for example of racism

Certainly in an area like that successful known prosecutions of police officers for racism I think it will do more to improve the confidence of the black community in the complaints procedure than say a hundred plus programmes uh put on by the Metropolitan Police

It 's to debate whose scheme is best and the whole future of local government that we 've come here to the heart of Nottingham to the Council House where the city 's political decisions are taken

And let 's start right away with the issue of this new council tax and whether the Conservatives are now off the hook

Uhm let me bring in the Conservative leader of the county council Ken Thompson

Do you believe this is it

Uh were you forgiven now for the poll tax 

Uhm I must confess that I 'm unrepentant about the poll tax

I think there were many virtues of that tax

and I 'm glad to see some elements at least remain in

At least we are including eighty per cent of the people

And that was a great virtue I think in trying to get everybody to pay something and I 'm glad to see that we 've retained that element

But are there incipient problems Mr Bradbury in the in this tax because already Conservative M Ps are starting to grumble about it aren't they and saying it 's affecting the middle-class middle house owner uh and damaging the political chances for the party in that way

Do you think a lot of other things are going to come out as time goes on

Well I don't see it that way

I mean in Nottingham seventy-five per cent of the properties fall into band A and B which means seventy-five per cent of the the couples in Nottingham will be paying three hundred and twenty-nine pounds or less unless

uh there 's a a the one person pr in the property

So in terms of the actual amount they 're paying I think they 'll be very pleased and that 's what it 's all about how much they 're paying for local services

But won't people be quibbling about which band they 're in

I mean A and B are the two lowest bands but if you 're if you 're just edging into B you stand to get a a bigger charge don't you

Well they 'll pay another fifty pounds

I I I I don't see that mattering

I I I think the people even in band G paying seven hundred pounds will say that 's very reasonable

These same people were paying twelve thirteen hundred pounds in rates so I don't think they 're going to object

So you think you 're off the hook

Do you think they 're off the hook

No I don't because poll tax is still with us and it will be for three or four years 

Uhm the way they 're dithering about with the council tax

I mean people were saying to me on the doorstep today will there be seven bands or nine bands

I said I don't know

Even Mr Heseltine doesn't know 

Not only have they got too many bands then they haven't even got a conductor yet to orchestrate the whole thing 

Uhm

so people are still confused because they keep telling me the Government are confused about what they want to do

How on earth can the ordinary voter make a judgement on a tax that even the Government haven't got clear

Mm

Mm

But to be straightforward Betty Higgins is there really that much difference now between what Conservative and Labour are proposing

You have already heard one of the Conservative county councillors say that they have nothing to be repentant about on poll tax

I think it 's a great shame that the Tories have never actually said to the British people

we 're sorry 

we made a mess of it 

and now we 're going to try and do better

No

That 's right

Yeah

David Mortimer

Liberal Democrats certainly do not believe that the Government have got themselves off the hook with this new council tax

And our canvassers talking to electors in the city and county for the forthcoming elections are finding that the voters are being very cautious indeed in weighing up whether this new tax is going to be fair

For example single elderly people with their reduction of only twenty-five per cent on the basic rate are very dubious about whether this tax is going to offer them substantial help or tor or or not

Students for example with a twenty-five per cent rebate some of them will find themselves even worse off than under the poll tax

No not with voters

Going to be very careful

But there are always losers aren't there in any in any tax

What 's your expert view on this Who 's

Who is going to lose

I mean we 've heard this famous example of Norman Tebbit 's secretary who wrote to the newspapers saying that she was actually going to pay more in a tiny flat in the centre of London than Michael Heseltine in his grand house

And And they they seem to be a bit discomfited by that

Is it is it g Are there going to be a lot of anomalies of exactly the kind there were with poll tax

I think there are anomalies in virtually any tax system you have

What we 're talking about here is moving from a tax on people back to a tax on property broadly

And that will mean that people who will lose out overall will tend to be in larger properties where there are two or one or two adults

and those who will gain will be small properties where there are many adults several adults

So there will be gainers and losers of that kind

But of course there will also be significant differences from authority to authority in the actual level of the charge

And I think that 's what Mr Tebbit 's secretary was complaining about

She thought her charge in the City was too high compared with Mr Heseltine 's at his homes

Margaret Hodge 

Going back to a property tax may be welcome and that 's what the Labour party 's been promoting

What is unfair and I think what Tony Travis has failed to point out is that by setting the ceiling and we understand so far there are seven bands though well they may be dithering into nine by setting a ceiling you 're in fact giving people in high-valued property a subsidy and you 're then making those in lower-valued properties pay more

And that 's where it 's unfair

If your property 's worth a hundred and seventy thousand three hundred thousand or a million pounds you will be paying the same

People living further south as we move down the south of the country will find themselves with a a with a huge bill with less Government grant although they may be poor

If you really want to relate it to the ability to pay you don't do these back of the envelope exercises that the Government is indulging in

you really do a property valuation and then you bring in a rebate system which really relates to ability to pay

Councillor Watson is there a problem in district councils all over the country that that the North is going to be paying much less than the South that it 's an imbalance between north and south for this tax

I don't think it 's an imbalance

But you 're going to o obviously find uhm with this tax that the way it 's going to operate it 's going to be a lot easier to collect certainly a lot cheaper to administrate

So when you 're in fact looking at the bands of property you 're going to actually see that the one in band A is in fact paying two thirds less than the person in the centre band and the person in the high band that uh Margaret is referring to is in fact paying two and a half times the person in the lowest band

So it does di demonstrate an ability to pay

It 's a mildly progressive tax

But it But it 's not totally progressive in the way that the the uh Liberal Democrats income tax scheme is

I mean it 's designed to make everybody pay a bit and richer people pay a bit more but not to go right to the top 

True

but equally you I think you 've got to pick up the point about how efficient the council is

If a council is delivering a low and reasonable charge and therefore they 're not excessive spenders then the people in that area are definitely going to have a lower figure

I think honestly one has to come in

That is a nonsense

It is completely un-uh-fair unfair and totally nothing to do with the efficiency to say that somebody in the highest band in Westminster will be paying less than most people in the rest of the country in the lowest band

That 's a fiddle in the way that the grant is distributed

Uhm  Mr Brandan Braver

One of the great advantages of a band type valuation rather than a specific type valuation is it avoids all the problems of the old rating system when people improved their homes

Now we 've had an absolute assurance that for instance if under the old system if people put central heating in or had double glazing or spent a couple of thousand on their home they immediately had a greater local tax to pay under the old rating system

and the Labour party are leaving that in

We are not going to discourage people from improving their homes because there will not be general revaluations and they will remain in the broad band in which the local valuers have placed them

But do you believe people will wrangle about the band they 're in because there can be quite a significant change in tax

I doubt it because they may not know precisely the value they 've been ass assigned

If they 're told  

They won't 

if a person is told they are in band B they 're going to have to tr they 'll have the right of appeal but they 're going to have to show what they think it 's worth in precise terms and whether it should be the whole band down

Uhm what uh what has been happening in Scotland

What has your experience in Lothian been of this

Are you i Is it going to be possible to have the poll tax for another two or three years

or is the backlog going to get too great

No

I don't think it is going to be possible for us to continue to collect poll tax for the next two years

and that 's where the big weakness is in your council tax

It takes far too long for us to get rid of the poll tax

And the poll tax for us in Scotland has been an unmitigated disaster

Uh one out of every three uh poll tax payers are now in arrears with their payments and Scottish local authorities are owed some four hundred and fifty million pounds

To try and put that into some sort of context one authority Lothian is owed ninety-five million pounds which is equivalent to what we actually spend every year on our social work bud budget

If a business had made the same mistake as the Government has made in introducing the poll tax against all informed advice I don't think we would allow them to run a business again but

But what what is actually going to happen in Lothian over the next three years then

Well in Lothian we are actually going to have to reduce our expenditure in line with our lower income

I mean as councillors we are legally obliged to try and ensure that our expenditure matches our income

So what we 're going to be faced with is rising bills and dramatic cuts in local authority expenditure

Can I say this point David

The key issue I think is how do we ensure that local government survives the next two years

I 've never the thought the key issue has been how do we fea defeat the poll tax

There 's far too many flaws in it

The key issue is how do we ensure that local government survives the poll tax

And what the Government should have done straight away to ease our collection problems is introduce one hundred per cent rebates as of April the first this year for the poorest of society

If that principle is right for the new council tax it must be right for the poll tax

Robin Wendt uh do you think that the county councils are going to have difficulty getting money 

I mean it 's collected by the district councils and passed on to the county

Is the whole system going to grind to a halt over the next two years

No I don't think it will because we know that there is a reasonable amount of collection of the present poll tax and I would be fairly confident that that will continue

I do not see the whole system of local government finance grinding to a complete halt during the next two years difficult though those years will be

And our first question please







That part of U N Resolution Six Sixty which calls upon Iraq and Kuwait to begin immediate intensive negotiations 

Do you think there 's evidence of support for such negotiations from the United Kingdom and the American governments

Tom Sawyer 

Uhm 

Well I think perhaps we 've got a different position from the United Kingdom and from the American government

I  uh was very disappointed this week to hear Mrs Thatcher 's attitude to the Gulf crisis

Uh I thought that really she was banging the war drum and uh making things much worse than they need to be

Uhm the American Secretary of State however uhm Mr Baker has been touring Europe

He 's been talking to uh heads of state

He 's been to uh the U S S R

He 's been in Britain today

And he 's been looking at the the possibilities of having some meaningful dialogue between the parties

And I think this has been a very constructive and uh worthwhile approach

Uh I 'm not sure what he 's heard from Mrs Thatcher today

I think that uh Mrs Thatcher doesn't really represent the British people  in her over-the-top attitude to the Gulf war

I think that uh she takes a far too hard line

I think she speaks uhm for herself

I don't know that she really speaks for the Cabinet but she certainly speaks for herself and doesn't I don't think on this occasion uh reflect the mood of the British people

Uhm are you Tom speaking there as Chairman of the Labour Party reflecting the Labour Party 's view 

Well I think the Labour Party view would be very much to get solidly behind a U N policy

Uh we know what U N policy is

It is to clear Saddam Hussein uh out of Kuwait and to make sure that uh reparations are properly made

It 's to make sure that uh sanctions work and uh that sanctions are given time to work

And the Labour Party I believe want sanctions to work

I think that in the Labour Party we believe that uh  one year of sanctions would be preferable to one day of war

Uh a war in the Gulf would be more horrific than uh most people in this hall could contemplate

Certainly all the members of the panel here tonight are too young to really remember the Second World War

and I think that 's probably the case for many people in the audience tonight

Uh the Labour Party doesn't want a war

It wants sanctions to work

It believes in negotiations and diplomacy and we think that 's the right approach for the months ahead

Uh thank you 

Margery Thompson 



































Are you saying Margery Thompson that for you there is no war option and that diplomacy negotiations is the only acceptable option





I don't think Edward Heath is p saying that

But let me go on to Malcolm Rifkind

Well nobody in their right mind wants war either in the Middle East or anywhere else

But I think what we have to ask ourselves is are we serious about our determination to ensure that Saddam Hussein leaves Kuwait a friendly country which he invaded with no excuse

He 's not only conquered that country and claimed to absorb it in Iraq but all the reports suggest that he 's carrying out very substantial atrocities against the people of that country

The United Nations have shown remarkable unity 

Uh even the Soviet uh Foreign Minister yesterday uh was saying that it may be necessary to use force at the end of the day if sanctions do not work

And does anyone seriously believe that Saddam Hussein is the sort of person uh who would even contemplate a withdrawal from Kuwait uh if the rest of the international community ruled out the use of force if sanctions do not work

After all Saddam Hussein  uh led his people they although they were not given much choice in the matter in an eight year war against Iran in which hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were slaughtered without any interest being shown by Saddam Hussein uh in their fate

And in the real world which we all have to live in  a dictator a tyrant like Saddam Hussein  is going to listen with great amusement to those who say well we 're going to simply use economic sanctions we 're simply going to use diplomatic negotiations but we rule out in advance uh the option of force even if these fail

Do to answer the the the questioner 's main point do you believe that  the British Government and the American Government are and I 'm quoting his quote from Resolution sixty Six Sixty uhm supporting all efforts in regard to creating intensive negotiations between Iraq and Kuwait

Well I don't think you can negotiate if by negotiations you mean can we allow Saddam Hussein to hold on to part of Kuwait

I think that is not a proper or legitimate response when a country has been invaded 

Professor Wilkinson 

Uh I believe that it is unrealistic to expect a simple fast diplomatic solution to a complex crisis like this

It 's quite clear that the U N resolution demanding the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait is quite unambiguous quite unequivocal

And it 's quite clear from Saddam 's statement of defiance over only in the last couple of days  that he is absolutely adamant in his determination to stay there 

So the prospects for a diplomatic agreement seem to be very grim at the present time

But I what I would like to say is this

I find the view that is being expressed in certain quarters that there is only a choice between all-out war to liberate Kuwait and defeat Saddam and topple his system or appeasement that is giving in and abandoning the U N resolutions utterly absurd

After all we are throwing away forty-five years of experience in the post-war period in which we have faced dictator after dictator  some of them far more ruthless and with far greater weaponry than even Saddam can muster 

And what has been done in response to that

Did we give way to Stalin

Did we give way to other dictators

Certainly not

What was done was to develop the techniques of containment deterrents and crisis management

These require skill and patience

And they may take many months sometimes years to work through but I believe that they are better than the alternative of war

And I do not believe for one moment that we have yet exhausted those possibilities of crisis management in respect of Iraq and the crisis 

Are you saying there is more that could be done on this front than is being done at the moment 

I believe that there is far more that can be done

I think part of the uh activity that we should be pressing for is greater Arab development of a security system in their part of the world where this danger is obviously most evident to them where they are afraid for their security

we should be developing the kind of systems that worked so well for us in Europe for forty-five years of of the cold war

It seems to me utterly absurd to forget that forty-five years and keep reverting to the nineteen thirties as if that 's the only event that ever happened in history

That false analogy is very misleading and I think will create very bad advice a very bad background for policymakers if they forget the intervening history when we 've had to find other ways of avoiding war and yet not giving in to dictators

You used the phrase in in some quarters when you  described the two apparently over simple options of all-out war or appeasement

Uh are those some quarters are is what you are saying to have been blunt about it in the United States and Britain or what

I detect in the United States ' latest addition a realisation that it is important to keep the United Nations Security Council consensus

and that I very much welcome

I think it 's very important that in this moment of history where for the first time the United Nations Security Council looks as if it is going to be able to do something effective about a major regional crisis uh threatening the peace that we keep that coalition together that we do not break up the important cooperation that is emerging between the Soviet Union and America

And the trouble is that if there is a unilateral action

and I don't really think now that Mr Bush is heading for that

I think he wants to work through the United Nations

but if there is a unilateral action it will I 'm afraid gravely damage this newly emerging U N consensus and the cooperation between the superpowers 

Would our questioner like to have a comment on what you 've heard 











Thank you very much 

And to our next question please





Secretary of State

No

I don't think there 's the slightest possibility for one very obvious reason quite apart 

Well  for all for all the

There 's lots of obvious reasons

but the most obvious one uh is that the question of whether there is war or peace in the Gulf will be primarily a decision taken in Washington

and the vast majority of the troops the allied troops in the Gulf are of course United States troops

There are important contributions from the United Kingdom and from many other both European and Arab countries uh

but it 's an allied force and not a force belonging to any one uh individual or one government

Uh but I in any event I resent the background to the question because that implies that uh m Margaret Thatcher is seeking uh party political advantage uh from what is an international crisis

Could we have the first question please 





Mrs Menzies asks very simply and straightforwardly whether Saddam Hussein should stand trial for war crimes

William Wallace

No 

uh no

because  the whole concept of war crimes imposes Western values on the Arab world in a very delicate situation in which uh it 's quite clear the Iraqi government has done some appalling things not only to the Kuwaitis but also to his own population 

But we need to get out of this war into a peace which the Arabs themselves have to make and anything which suggests that the Western Christian world is imposing its own values on the Muslim world is something which we ought now to avoid

We have pursued  we have pursued a limited war for limited objectives

We have won those objectives thank goodness

Now it is most important to make sure that we restore to the Middle East as far as possible a lasting peace settlement

George Robertson 

I think there 's a good case for it uh on paper anyway because I think some of the things that Saddam Hussein has done both in the past and in the recent case of uh of Kuwait

And I met uh an Iraqi exile yesterday uh who made the very good point that these horrors that we are seeing now in our newspapers uh that had happened to the Kuwaiti people in the last seven months

He said

the Kuwaiti people have only had it for seven months

and he said he did nothing there that he didn't do to his own people over the twelve years that he 's been in power

And the other case that would be put forward is the one that says that unlike Pol Pot and Idi Amin and uh the other hordes of uh these uh tyrants in the past he invaded another state and perpetrated it on these uh that foreign population so that there is a case

And I think that there will be a revenge factor and there is obviously a huge resentment

But I feel along with William Wallace that we must be very careful about the future

Saddam Hussein did not do that on his own

He is the tyrant and he has a very personal horrible rule but he wasn't alone in that

And if we are going to then seek out and uh pursue large numbers of people who might have been engaged in that then that is going to take up all the energies that I think should perhaps more fruitfully be used in other directions

But I don't think it should be up to us even to the alliance that fought Saddam Hussein in this case to make the decision about war crimes or whether there should be a prosecution

I believe that that should be a decision taken by the United Nations as a whole

If they decide that it 's necessary then so be it

But I think on balance I would tend to vote against

Mary Kaldor

Uhm well I  tend to agree with both William Wallace and George Robertson

The only thing that I would say is that uh I 'm not sure it 's just us  that think these atrocities are awful

I would hate to think that the kind of atrocities that Saddam Hussein has committed uh are only considered horrible according to Western Christian values

I have no doubt that they are also considered horrible according to Muslim values and it 's probably up to the Arabs and the United Nations to decide whether or not he should be prosecuted

I also think that the most horrible things have resulted from our bombing campaign 

Uh we heard uh in on the television yesterday that some a hundred thousand young men were killed in the bombing while the casualties on the Western side were only only a hundred and twenty-eight

And I think that would be considered an incredible war crime a kind of active technological genocide on the other side and 

So I think it 's quite complicated once we start getting into who committed which crimes

John Patten complicated or simple

Well very complicated

It is necessary for me to uh put in a preamble before I answer the questioner 's question directly

and that is that talks begin tomorrow about the bringing to an end formally of hostilities and the bringing back of prisoners who 've been taken by Saddam Hussein 's rej regime and the bringing back to Kuwait of uh those people who 've been taken off as hostages

I think we all have to be a bit careful because hostages have been taken and have been kept before by the Iraqi regime

And the most important thing of all is to make sure that all prisoners of war and everyone who 's been trans-shipped into Iraq

They talk of eight thousand Kuwaiti armed service men and some twenty-two thousand Kuwaiti citizens

Uh uh I wouldn't want to say or do anything that upset the possibilities of making sure they come back as quickly as possible

And that having been said uhm Mrs Beeton always said in her recipes didn't she first catch your hare

We haven't got him in the jug uh

Saddam Hussein uh

No one knows where he is or what is going to happen to him

There is a huge amount of international law dating right back to the Hague Convention of nineteen O seven the Geneva Convention of nineteen forty-nine and uh all those other bits and pieces which make up the warp and weft of international rule today

And there 's no doubt at all about it that if  war crimes trials are to be mounted they could be mounted

There 's enough in international law and there 's enough evidence there

I guess in Kuwait anyway those Iraqis and others who 've been captured and uh who may be put on trial for committing atrocities will be dealt with under Kuwaiti law

and that 's pretty stern and pretty rough stuff

I think it 's absolutely clear to me that uhm as far as war crimes trials are concerned it 's going to be something where the Arab nations

and let 's remember that eight Arab nations had people in the front line fighting against the Iraqis

it 's the Arab nations perhaps encouraged by the international community who 're going to have to decide in the end how war crimes trials are to be conducted and if they are to happen

But just uh one final footnote

There is no hiding place I think anywhere around the world now for Saddam Hussein

No sensible country would want to take him they 'd just end up as pariah states

Thank you very much

Could we have a second question please





Thank you Mr Jones

That will give the panel a chance to expand on what they 've been saying

Uh you ask whether in the aftermath of the conflict which has proved shorter than so many people predicted uh how the panel feel about the the nature of the struggle for the Arabic leadership in the area if uh as you put it Saddam Hussein were to hang on

George Robertson

Well I 'm not sure that he 'll he 'll hang on

Uh I I 'm pretty sure now that having lost two dreadful wars disastrously that he can go on with his stooges pretending on Baghdad Radio that this was the mother of victories when everyone knows that it was the father of all defeats

And I think that the Iraqi people and there are large numbers of them honourable and decent who have been suppressed and repressed and tortured and beaten and bombed over all of these years that they are going to exert their view

And I think that they must be encouraged to implement a democratic structure to follow this and not just have yet another military regime

And frankly I think that once the propaganda has died down uh it will be seen that what he has perpetrated in attacking two of his neighbouring states was not in the interests of the Arab world at all

Even although for a moment or two he perhaps enthused the street crowds with the idea that he stood up to the infidels and stood up to the West and to the Americans the fact is that he personally has probably killed more Muslims than any other person this century and that 's not something that 's going to be forgotten

Neither will it be forgotten that when he got into a hole last week  just at the very end of this uh uh at the e before the end of this conflict what he ditched first in his great conditions for the war was the linkage with the Palestinian people

It was always bogus but it looked as though it was going to be a bonus for people who feel that they 've lost out in all the battles before

But yet that was the first thing that he jettisoned when he was looking for his own personal survival and that won't be lost either

I think that if the United Nations and the world community moves on swiftly to convene the International Conference which is now authorised by a United Nations resolution passed in the middle of this conflict

sets about sorting out some of the major problems especially the Arab Israeli problem with some enthusiasm and with some sincerity then Arab opinion is going to swing away from the murderous tyrant that Saddam Hussein was and the countries like Egypt especially will come out of this conflict 

And I think that perhaps there has been a blow struck uh for sensibility and for security in the future of this dreadful area

John Patten

Do you share that optimism

Three things

And yes I do do

I I 'm I 'm very hopeful

Uh first of all it 's quite interesting to see the sceptics and the pundits largely speaking proved wrong about what was going to happen uh in the Gulf

and uh I suppose that teaches us all a lesson about predicting things uhm which makes it all the more difficult to to answer the question

Because it is very hard to predict who is going to assume the leadership if any one person is going to assume the leadership

and I hope it won't be one man or one woman

I hope it 'll be uh uh a different setup altogether

The the second thing I want to say is what a remarkable week it 's been

I mean we we forget that at the beginning of this week the Warsaw Pact finally came to an end

I mean that 's just been largely ignored uh in the news

And that 's a very good piece of news

And here we see what with luck may well be the last ever large-scale land battle in world history

And the third point I want to make is that uh I agree entirely with what George Robertson said

It was a piece of sleight of hand of Saddam Hussein to try to link the conflict to the Palestinian question

He didn't even remember to do so until ten days out into the conflict itself when he poured it in as a as a bargaining counter

But I guess that whatever else happens in the in the Gulf Sir to answer your question the focus will come right back on the on on the Palestinian question

And I think it 's critically important that

it won't just be one conference

it 'll be months and years of talking

It 's not all going to be settled by a few people getting round the table in the next few weeks and sorting it out

That the Palestinian issue is uh satisfactorily sorted both from the point of view of the Israelis who I think have reacted with magnificent courage in the face of Scud missiles raining in on their territory i i in not retaliating

you 've got to have them behind secure borders but at the same time the Palestinians have got to be brought in from the cold

Clive Aslet the the very phrase country life seems to e evoke all sorts of ideas of bosky downs and wellington boots and all those kinds of things

But when we talk about country life  are we talking about a myth or a reality 

It 's an ideal but it 's an ideal which I think has always been rooted in hard economic fact

In the eighteenth century for instance when the cult of the picturesque was a great idea that would go into European civilisation people planted landscape parks  uh because they express spiritual values

But on the other they wouldn't have done that if it hadn't been for the economic return they were getting from the trees and so on 

And uh I think that 's also the case today

It 's part of the complication of the countryside that it 's both an ideal and a hard economic fact

And of course Rodney Legge it 's it 's a hard statistical fact that in fact we 've been a  predominantly urban society for a hundred and fifty years now

and yet we still seem to think of ourselves in some way as countrymen

Why do you think that is

We need our countryside more because we are an urban society

And there 's still this linkage between landscape and the romantic imagination

You can go back to George Herbert and Wiltshire poets of the seventeenth century and uhm nymphs and shepherds of Drayton and uh all that sort of thing

and it goes through to the images of the scenic posters of the Second World War when they were telling us

your country is worth fighting for 

And with that coupling of patriotitism patriotism as well  it led through to the current day 's problems because Hugh Dalton set up the National Land Fund after the war which was for cherished pieces of our landscape to be preserved as a living memorial to the one and a half million  men and women of the British Empire who died in two world wars 

Well that 's been born again as the National Heritage Memorial Fund

and fair enough

But like the National Trust it has gone through a phase of being I would say abused as the safety net for the country house art treasures rather than looking after landscape 

Sir Simon Gourlay we hear there about the the values of the countryside pastoralism patriotism and those things

but surely from the point of view of the farmer it 's it 's all to do with the hard ecu and and the hard facts of of driving tractors across large fields isn't it

It it is more business than than this sort of spiritual talk isn't it 

It 's the farmer 's workshop so it is to that extent a hard business background

But I think in every farmer there 's something of the spiritual challenge of the countryside 

And uh certainly as a sort of semi-urban creature myself these days I 'm very aware of that aspect of it 

Uh when I go home at the weekends it 's not just going home to the farm which is a business

it 's going home to something uh which is much deeper than that

It sort of revives me every week

And uh although we are largely an urban society uh I believe that over eighty per cent of the population like to get out into the countryside uh at least once a month

So it 's it 's much more than uh it 's much more reality than myth even to an urban population

I suppose

Clive Aslet

I suppose that statistic which you gave eighty per cent of  the population wanting to go into the countryside there 's a great change that has taken place since the motorcar really because at the beginning of the century for instance people would have gone en masse in an excursion train to the seaside  whereas the great thing that 's happened since the second world war is that everybody wants to go to the countryside

And so you have people pouring into the countryside and it 's uhm  it 's filling up

But of of course the point is that this this countryside is itself this home this spiritual home to which Sir Simon Gourlay returns at the weekend as as many of us do is in fact uhm  uhm unreal in the sense that that its only reality is that is that we have made it

I mean again Sir Simon Gourlay you talk about the uh the countryside as a as the farmer 's workshop and and workplace and actually  nature would you not agree Rodney Legge is in fact the creation of man

It is a a work of work itself 

It 's the work of man

but it 's also a work of nature because I would argue that when nature is left full play as on Salisbury Plain and the firing ranges down at Lulworth in Dorset you 've got the most superb primeval landscape

you 've got landscape that 's better than anything inside our national parks

So nature can be left alone and do its own thing magnificently and achieve a reservoir for wildlife that Sir Simon 's intensive agriculture just doesn't manage

And if Sir Simon with I dunno don't know about eight hundred acres of what uh uh near uh Knighton in Powys isn't really an intensive farmer I 'm sure a lot of your members are 

Well yes uh 

Some farmers have reservoirs and they irrigate uh

But uh surely it 's a symbiosis between nature and the artefact that man has created

I mean if you go back to the eighteenth century and the idyllic countryside that Clive mentioned uhm that uh changed at the in the eighteenth century and the early part of the nineteenth century

Uh one of the things that 's associated with beautiful countryside is hedgerows 

Well certainly some hedgerows are very old indeed but an awful lot of hedgerows were created in the late th late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 

I thought they 'd been rubbed out in this century

Uh uh that 's right they 've changed that 's the point

they 've changed from wide rolling open spaces to enclosures and now uh to wider open spaces again

We have a mixture of of both at home

So the land landscape willy nilly is changing all the time but now i it 's coming under intense pressure

And it 's coming under intense pressure from that eighty per cent of the population that that wants to go to the uh to the countryside

And this is where I the difficulties begin because immediately we get a conflict between uh the countryside as something which belongs patriotically to the nation and the countryside which belongs spe specifically to certain people

Now how does the Open Spaces Society resolve that problem of access

Well it 's how Sir Simon and his friends resolve the problem because the present rights of way system has never worked

and now we see it in terminal decline because the situation as outlined in Countryside Commission statistics are that uhm a third of rights of way are blocked at any one time

you can't go more than two miles into the countryside without encountering a blockage

And now we 've got this disastrous initiative from them to create nice things called say the Leyland Trail near me running from Alfred 's Tower to Camelot Cadbury Castle in South Somerset

Well this is a hierarchical situation where you get super paths which are well looked after and well walked and yet everything south of it around the A Three O Three road to the West of Wincanton is blocked and unusable

Sir Simon Gourlay

How how d' you answer for the farmer who has to look after his land

Well uh

the rights of way system uhm  some of which undoubtedly has been ploughed up or blocked in some way or another is a very ancient system

and I think it has its roots more in social and the economic uh need necessity than it does in in uh the pleasure of enjoying the countryside

I mean uh

it 's quite clear that farmers are very happy uhm or most farmers are are very happy I 'm glad to say to give access to the country to people in in the countryside

But you know one of the problems that I have at home for instance is that uhm we get uh I 'm I 'm I 'm perfectly happy that anybody can go anywhere on the farm and uh it 's not blocked anywhere as far as I am aware

There 's an old right of way that 's been ploughed up

But we get an awful lot of people who come out

They don't go far off the roads but they do make an awful mess

They leave their litter everywhere

Clive Aslet

I 'm slightly worried by Rodney 's romantic imagination carrying him too far on this because uh there really is very very little wilderness true wilderness in this country

Nearly everything is uh a result of the interaction of man with nature

The Norfolk Broads for instance some of our best loved landscape uh uh uh is formed by the very reprehensible practice of peat digging

Uh the New Forest was planted by Norman kings etc

And if Rodney 's vision were pushed to the limit  and there were  large areas of true wilderness they would in fact be  totally impenetrable and nobody could walk in them at all

And such wilderness as we do have is actually wearing out because we have so much access 

Well I 've trespassed and walked all over the Lulworth tank gunnery ranges including me having the odd shell whizzing over my head and it 's by no means impenetrable to me but anyway

We move on from impact zones or back really to the Knighton path

Now we have this new piece of law to save our footpaths in England and Wales and and make sure that they 're reinstated after the far our farmers churned them up on arable land 

Is Sir Simon for instance putting his footpaths and bridle ways if he 's got them back into use in other words  reinstating a metre wide footpath or a bridle way that 's usable between two and three metres that 's firm and marked on the ground 

Well there is uhm there 's one path which was marked I think on a very old edition of of of the map which is no longer marked which is a a field that happens to be grass at the moment but it is ploughed up from time to time

There 's a  a road uh all the way around it uh which anybody is very welcome to use at any time

I don't think the the path actually is any any longer marked on the on the definitive map

And uhm uh so I haven't reinstated that path which was on an old map

but the access to to that countryside and for getting you from A to B uh is there for anybody who wants to use it at any time

And I think that is the important thing surely not that we should quibble about whether the path exactly follows uh uh uh the route that may have been on a map once upon a time

Well  

We can't we can't purs pursue this I have to I have to allow I cannot pursue this we cannot pursue this right of way hearing here Rodney Legge

But uh But Clive Aslet would you not agree that this particular dispute about a specific path illustrates the the problem which is uh of of the second pressure on the countryside which is conservation which is a we have so many people actually trying to get into the countryside that the countryside is is in danger of disintegration

secondly people expect this countryside to be conserved

But who do you think is best qualified to manage that conservation

Is it the pressure group like the Open Spaces Society or is it the farmer

Well I think it 's unquestionably the farmer because uh  the landscape has got to be farmed otherwise it will degenerate into something which people  don't recognise

It may  some people may think it 's got quality in itself but it certainly won't be the landscape with which people were brought up

Uh I think uh there 's an argument for saying for instance uh we need more footpaths

We need new footpaths because very often the historic route of footpaths  isn't particularly convenient to walk on because they 're uh linking two points which was convenient for a milkmaid but not particularly convenient for a walker 

So I think that we need to uh give attention to this

And in fact there are some quite encouraging signs

for instance uh in East Anglia uhm eighty miles of uh bridle way has just been formed through an arrangement between sixty different farms

Mm

Yes

He had three areas of his objectives

He said first the uhm the Allies had started off to try and hit and destroy the leadership command and control

Now leadership com command and control doesn't mean to say let 's go for Saddam Hussein 's bunker

It means all the commanders of the forces

They have a command system which is includes electronics

It includes where they actually hide in their bunkers uhm

And you actually have to try and destroy that

Then he said they wanted to try and get to the air defence system 's command

Now this includes the radars uhm the the air defence missiles the air defence artillery as well as of course the aircraft themselves

Wanted to try and knock out the nuclear biological and chemical installations

These are the places for example where the where the nuclear weapons experimentation has been going on the biological warfare uhm facilities and also the chemical warfare facilities

and then hit at the Republican Guard

Now this is the big army which is based just north of Kuwait and is considered the elite of uh his fighting force on the ground

That was phase one

Now just in that phase one

Can you describe in phase one what the purpose of those objectives was

Well very simple

We get back to this idea of hitting command and control uhm and air defence

If you can get at the command and control of any force whether it 's a naval an air force or an army then you 're getting at its brain

If you get at its brain then it can't operate successfully

And that is why they pounded day after day after day at those sort of things

Now it is paying off uhm he says because for example the the air force can't communicate on its primary sources of command and control and therefore even if it were to be up in the air it couldn't actually be coordinated properly and therefore couldn't uh uh fly as a as a consolidated force

And then there was phase two

Yes

This was really going for the air fields and going for and establishing what they call air superiority

Air superiority basically means that if you go up and another plane an enemy plane comes towards you you can deal with him as opposed to air superiority is when you go up and there 's not going to be an enemy aeroplane coming towards you

So he was going for air fields and air superiority

Now he emphasised the gains we 've heard in the past fourteen days

If you go for an air field and you hit it you got to go back and hit it again because they don't stay hit

Air fields don't do that

But then they were trying to knock out the shelters

and we 're going now really to s to stage three because what happened is that Saddam Hussein during the past ten twelve days of this campaign of fourteen days uhm put his prime aircraft in hardened shelters

Now a hardened shelter is a reinforced hangar which is covered by earth uh

and it 's covered by sand perhaps

and it 's reinforced

and its mesh reinforced

They were hitting them and so much so that they could actually hit a hangar

Uh so that means you 've got nowhere to put the aircraft

And when they were lucky they actually hit hangars with aircraft in them

And he showed some film for example of of one of these reinforced hangars being hit by a a television guided bomb

This is the precision bombing that he was talking about

Uhm big black plumes of spo smoke appeared

and his sign his his point there was that 's when they knew that an aircraft was inside

They didn't say whether any people were inside at the same time but he was talking about aircraft

That was one of those visual images that so startled us in the early uh days of the war with the the camera showing you going right down to the point of explosion

and then you see the explosion

and you can absolutely identify that particular target

When you go back again next day you can say

yes

we got that hardened shelter

We got that one

We missed two or three there

Yes

And a lot of this information is only coming out now because when they went back the next day there was cloud cover

and therefore they couldn't tell really how much damage they had done

But wasn't there also

I mean uh I drew the impression perhaps erroneously that he was yielding up information now because it was no longer important to keep it secret that the it didn't matter if Saddam now knew these facts

Yes

I mean it wasn't so much that Saddam knew the facts that Saddam Hussein uhm

I mean there was one stage in this war when uhm or the war so far when people were saying

I wonder if Saddam Hussein knows the extent of his damage 

Because if you 've knocked out the communication systems perhaps it 's not getting back to Saddam Hussein

and perhaps the commanders are not telling him the extent of the damage

But yes this detail was coming out

For example the on the communications the need to knock out communications

That includes highways

Now a lot of bridges between let 's say Baghdad where the main supplies come and to the south where the Republican Guard are

there are thirty-six bridges

He says they 've cut off thirty-three of them

Now during the past fourteen days or so that 's the sort of information that a lot of people really journalists have been asking for because it it it it illustrates the progress of the war

He 's not giving out this in information because he 's confident

He is saying right I 've got stacks of detailed geewhiz figures here

Make what you will of them

But what I am telling you overall that we are hitting Saddam Hussein 's forces to such an extent that he can't properly operate

It 's a very curious briefing in some ways

It 's almost s I call this in some ways a cartoon war

It was a briefing which was full of photographs

It was full of yet more video uhm

And it was almost like a video game  that you could without the sound

And therefore when one was hitting targets there was one there were no people involved

There was one point when he said I want to show you the luckiest man in Iraq

And this was a very impressive piece of bombing precision bombing where he said now watch this and there was you could clearly see what was a bridge

And the aircraft is zeroing on the bridge

and the cross-hairs of the of the of the target indicator as they call it is showing where the bomb will go

And then suddenly from the bottom appears a motor car 

And it 's driving

And he drives right through the cross hairs just before the missile is released and presumably got safely to the other side

It was the only time through the whole briefing a summary of of a fortnight that you got the impression that people were involved in this war

Well it is I was going to say

it is slightly sometimes disconcerting listening to uhm the description of the war in video game terms when whatever one 's view about how hideous the policies are of Saddam Hussein we know that we know today that there have been casualties obviously on both sides

Wars are uhm human events and they are individual and personal catastrophes  often

Yes

Yes

And the other part of this

You see this in fact when you 're talking or when he was talking about uh why they were cutting off certain supplies to this Republican Guard uh and the forces in Kuwait

Now he came up with a figure of twenty thousand tons of supplies mainly food that the Iraqi forces in Kuwait need

and he said

we 've cut off the supplies to such an extent they 're not getting more than two thousand tons as opposed to twenty thousand tons

He said

we 've got reports coming through that some of these uhm soldiers in in Kuwait the Iraqi soldiers are actually going around begging for food

He said they didn't have any water in wh in whi in which they could bathe

And it 's that sort of thing that gave the impression which I 'm sure he was trying to do

And looking at the figures

I mean a cursory glance at the figures you you get the idea of enormous superiority of a of an army and an air force being destroyed taking away from its function to operate as an army and an air force

A very confident general

What we didn't get to uhm nor do we expect them to do is a pure assessment of the next phase of the war

He 's given us three phases of the war in a fortnight and where he 's got to

And Paul Reynolds was talking about the the Foreign Office reaction to some of the our diplomatic correspondent earlier and he said it was he said the Foreign Office said it was OK

I think General Schwarzkopf here was saying as far as he is concerned this war so far is A OK

Uhm let me bring you in Eric Groves a naval specialist on this

The summary you you heard from Chris

In general terms did you  regard it in the same way with your expertise that this was a an A OK summary

and did you yourself judge it from what you heard to be appropriately described as A OK

I think so

I mean looking overall not just at the naval side but at the at the air side and the land side too I think

he was demonstrating that despite reports to the contrary the air campaign was going pretty well that they were taking out the targets dist that awful term taking out destroying the targets that they were wanting to destroy that they were preventing supplies getting through to the Iraqi army

But I must admit wh when one thinks of interdiction i it it this of this attack on supply lines usually it only works when there 's fighting going on at the front as well because of course there 're a large amount of stock pile there 's a large amount of stockpiling

and therefore when you can stop supplies coming in when you 're expending your supplies in action that 's when the interdiction really begins to hurt

I have a worry here that we 'll get the Iraqis so used to dealing with air attacks to find ways round

I mean bridges can can be destroyed

we don't know yet how good the Iraqis are at rebuilding them and so on that we will try softening after so long that in fact the Iraqis may may well find ways around the interdiction campaign before the land fighting starts when it 's which is when the interdiction is particularly important

Thank you very much

We 'll leave it there for a moment and return to that later

Uhm as the skirmishes have been taking place and as the land war clearly gets closer and as the navy has been very actively involved over the last twenty-four hours some four hundred Royal fleet reservists have been turning up for duty at the Portsmouth shore base H M S Nelson

These are men who 've served in the Royal Navy before and are trained at specialist tasks in the electronics supply engineering and as medics

All of them are junior rates and there 're among six hundred ratings

I should have said

and among six hundred who 've volunteered to come back for the duration of the Gulf crisis

Denis Skillicorn reports

Donald uhm Tories started badly in Blackpool but it got better for them as the week went on

Although I don't think they managed to match Labour they came out not bad at the end of the week

Yes

I think that 's right

I mean I think one of the strange things about the conference season is that in a sense the conferences have been  pretty successful for all three of the political parties 

But that 's right

I mean the the Tories started pretty messily

Uhm there was a very quiet day on Tuesday

The coverage was uhm a lot of noises off about the economy and so on and so forth so many people weren't really focussing on the conference

They obviously had this very difficult uh problem of handling Mrs Thatcher 's arrival which seems to have exercised the great minds of the party for many weeks before the conference

But once they had gone over that first of all William Waldegrave got them I think over the uh the the the

I mean he di

he did show that they were able to fight back on health

and secondly Michael Heseltine made one of his typical shameless and enormously successful performances

and that did get them back in the swing

I think

Yeah

It improved then

But Alistair you and I watched uhm John Major 's speech

It started well

There were then long boring passages in it

But when I got back home and saw it on television that night it played better on television than it did listening in the hall

Yeah

Yeah

The T the T I did the same

The TV news actually gave a better impression of the speech than  those who were there received of it

I thought it was an extremely boring speech

I also thought it was it was pretty low in content

We 'd been given this uh the advance billing that it was going to set out Major 's vision for the for the next decade

There was going to be a clean break with Thatcherism

And it just wasn't there

I mean I I thought the it was interesting that he was clearly knocked back I think by the reception Mrs Thatcher got

And the lines that got the most positive response from the the audience in the hall was a very negative statement on Europe a very positive statement on South Africa and a v a rather meaningless statement on education this back to the basics business which always wins a round of applause

but nev they never quite explain what they mean by going back to the basics

And I thought the overall impression in the hall was of a bad speech badly delivered

But I agree with you

On the television it came across rather well

But I do think that if if they think they 're going to win the election just by repeating a the notion that John Major 's a nice guy who once wasn't very well off it may be it 's a nice propaganda line

but it 's not a good strategy

Donald do you think that the the Tories are now beginning to get on top of the uh the Labour N H S privatisation claim

The uh

Obviously William Waldegrave addressed that in his speech

The Prime Minister did a much more personal  a approach to that that he 's the one who 's used the health service his family uses it

It 's inconceivable he says that he would preside over it its dissolution

There is a bit of a sense now that it could be beginning to backfire

Yes

I mean I think for example the polls the poll in The Sunday Times last weekend for example which showed that I think something I think like sixty-two per cent of people believe that believe then that the Government would privatise the health service

And  for the Labour Party showing even higher figures

Presumably for a start a lot of those people will actually be Tory voters

and I should 've thought that both William Waldegrave 's speech and John Major 's speech will 've at least uh influenced Tory voters who have this doubt to come back as it were into the fold

So I would think that the next poll on that is probably likely to show some change and it could be it could be coming their way

I mean the only thing that I would add to that is that I think in a way one of the difficult things for the Government on the health service is that I don't think they have a secret agenda to privatise the health service and I think increasingly few people do think that

I think Mrs Thatcher might possibly have done a lot of things uh that would 've been very different stimulated the private sector to a substantial extent in the fourth term and I think sooner or later the Government may actually have to say that

They may have to say that 's the direction we were going in

We 're not now

I think there 's that the slight sort of thing that you dare not say

But uh apart from that I think yes they are beginning to pull it round

Whether they can pull it round at for it not enough not for it not to be a big issue in the election uh we 'll have to see

It 's likely always to remain a an issue which they don't win but they can get a a bit bet than they can do better than they 've been doing

In a way isn't it Alastair a legacy of the Thatcher years or of Mrs Thatcher herself

She always gave the impression that uhm if you could you should use the private sector uh on all sort of things uh and that the public services were left there for uh people who couldn't afford the private sector

That 's not what John Major thinks

I don't agree

De I mean two three weeks ago John Maj John Major made a speech to BUPA in which he said he wanted the private sector to be boosted

He wanted more collaborative ventures between public and private

And I think I think Major 's got a problem in in in general terms in that he cannot speak to an audience without giving that audience some sort of goody

And that was the goody for BUPA

But I I think that it still remains the belief of many people in the Conservative Party

And I am not convinced of John Major 's commitment to the National Health Service

Not



Why not

Well partly because uh uh nothing is actually changed in terms

The rhetoric has changed

Nothing has changed in in the way that the the Conservatives view the National Health Service

Private is still good as far as they 're concerned

They they They can say all they want about the fact that they 're not going to charge for hospital visits they 're not going to privatise

The fact is the health service is being privatised

I think that Donald is on slightly the wrong line to say there 's a secret agenda

Privatisation to me means the movement of people from public to private the movement of bits of the health service from public to private

That is happening and it 's happening more and more slowly under John Major than it did under Mrs Thatcher

Yes

Wha

What bit of the health service has moved from public to private

Well there they they used the private sector is used much more in things like the the the pharma the drugs treatment of treatment of blood samples that kind of thing

There 're bits of the private sector being used in in things that were done before by the by the National Health Service

In terms of people more and more people are going into the private sector encouraged by the Government encouraged by the kind of statement that John Major made two weeks ago

But the Labour Party 's not going to abolish private medicine is it Donald

No

I don't think so

And I also don't think that in cases where uhm as a result of changes in the health service the public sector health service buys you free private care which is one you know one possibility in order to bring waiting lists down

I think it 's completely unrealistic to think that uhm that that won't be attractive to the vast majority of people including Labour voters

I mean I think that if you take as it were a theological attitude to uh private and public health care so that absolutely and everything that happens as a result of your going through the N H S you know is must be a problem it 's unrealistic

I don't see that 

The point

The point I 'm making is that it 's a fa it 's a false argument on both sides

The The Tories are trying to say that Labour are saying that they 're going to denationalize the National Health Service

Labour aren't saying that

Labour are saying that the health service is being privatised

and it is being eroded to such an extent that I think the private sector will will grow and grow and grow within the National Health Service and there will be a two tier National Health Service

And I think the same thing is happening to schools

More and more people are being f if you like forced into the private sector

and it becomes an accepted wisdom that people in certain areas one of them is London that have certain income bands the middle classes if you like the affluent middle classes that they should go private that they will go private

That is happening

Mhm

Yes

But I 'm not sure though that that 's an issue that will necessarily rebound against the Government

And there are many people who are going into private schools in Labour areas uh because of the state of state schools 

Uh it seems to me that whereas on health Labour clearly has an enormous advantage on the polls uh no matter what question you ask on education they 're far closer because the Government is able to pin a lot of what 's gone wrong in our education system in the state system on Labour authorities or the kind  educational evils

True

True

Mhm



Shirley Williams

I mean I think it is uh that 's quite true and I and I agree with you about Labour voters

On the other hand it is quite it is odd in a way that after twelve years in power the Tories are still able to say I mean you know this is fundamentally a problem

I mean it 's it 's a great and quite successful operation

I I was just looking at Ken Clark 's speech

You mean in the sense that they 've been in power for twelve years and the schools are bad

Yes and it 's still and it 's still bad 

Exactly

Exactly

And that it 's still a problem caused by the Labour Party

And I mean uhm I 'd I was thinking listening to Ken Clark 's speech in Blackpool

I was quite surprised that that argument is still playing

And works to some extent

And works to some extent

Yes

I mean it is true that you know I think a lot of people agree that some of the ideas of the sixties you know have made for worse education

Nonetheless I mean I think the Government uh have got to show that they are able to produce and not just slag off the Labour Party

And I think that 's probably why actually Ken Clark has been more of a continuous revolutionary has more programmes more ideas than some of his colleagues

We left Harold Wilson last week on the final day of his premiership the fifth of April nineteen seventy-six

That shock resignation of his still leaves a number of questions unanswered

Indeed one of them was raised by Lady Falkender in our last week 's programme

She claimed that the new Prime Minister Jim Callaghan had offered his predecessor the job of Foreign Secretary in his government

Joe Haines you were the Press Secretary at Number Ten at the time and indeed had been I think since nineteen sixty-nine

Do you think there 's any credibility in that claim

Well Harold mentioned it to me at the time  but I think it was one of those invitations like we must have lunch sometime

I think that Jim felt  slightly embarrassed taking over from the man who had actually facilitated his becoming Prime Minister

and he was uncertain what to do

Couldn't send him to the Lords

Harold at that time didn't want to go to the Lords

so thinking of the Home precedent offered him the Foreign Secretaryship certain that it 'd be refused

What about your biography Ben Pimlot Professor of Politics at Birkbeck are you taking

have you got that far

have you raised this uh subject at all

Well to be honest I hadn't come across this point but it doesn't se seem to be at all implausible that a as a kind of courtesy a Prime Minister resigning when he was still comparatively young should be made that kind of offer

I I imagine rather as uhm Joe says that it was a uh an offer expecting the answer no

I mean there were there were precedents

I mean Baldwin served uhm after being Prime Minister uhm i i in uh in other offices

Th uhm uh R R Ramsay MacDonald did and uhm and

and Lord Home

so i it would wouldn't have been extraordinary

And Balfour did

And Balfour

Uh so it wouldn't have been an extraordinary thing but uhm given the reasons I think for W Wilson 's resignation in that he 'd he 'd had enough and he 'd been in for a long time it s seemed unlikely that he would accept

Lord Jenkins by this time you were a member of the Government at the Home Office though you later went to Europe

Did you have any knowledge of this kind of thing

I mean you were hoping to be Foreign Secretary yourself

No I have uh ha had absolutely no knowledge of that

It came as a com complete surprise to me uhm when I heard it

Uhm uhm uhm I think I would take rather the same view that Joe Haines did on this particular point

Callaghan awfully liked talking about jobs not altogether seriously

Before he was Prime Minister he was a great one for offering other people jobs that weren't at his disposal

He offered Tony Crossland the Chancellorship of the Exchequer in nineteen sixty-seven when he resigned

and so he may of he he may of have talked freely about it

I don't think this was seriously in his disposition

I had a very frank talk with him the following morning about offices when as you rightly say he was not disposed to offer me the Foreign Secretaryship

but he talked around the field

and I certainly had no confirmation there that he was holding it for the possibility of of Harold Wilson taking it

Which you got

Well let 's go on if we may to the other sort of legacy of Harold Wilson 's Prime Ministership

and that was the very controversial Honours List that I think came out finally on May the twenty-seventh i e some time after uh six weeks or so after he 'd resigned the Prime Ministership but had been trailed I think in a number of newspapers beforehand including a fairly full lead Joe Haines in the Sunday Times

Well I think the the Honours List

I 've never concealed my view

I think it did him great damage

There were a number of people in that list who I regarded as uh  as not fulfilling uh the uhm the requirements of an honours list

Those who some of those who went to the House of Lords did not go there in order to be working peers

Others had no  visible  uh reason why they should have had a an honour

Uh it was well known that several of them had helped finance the the office of Prime Minister in the past but that Honours List I think did him lasting damage and should never have been uh created

I think that he uhm a great deal of fuss was make made about it at the time and it was a curious collection of honours

Uhm there have but Prime Ministers are often quite whimsical about their honours

I think Mrs Thatcher has been uh been so uh quite often

I think it was uh expectation that a Labour Prime Minister would be more kind of pure as driven snow about the honours distributed

uhm I also think as a matter of fact that it 's very trivial

uhm

and I think probably Harold Wilson regarded it as a rather trivial affair

and he he p perhaps didn't take as much care over it as as he should have done as his last gasp uhm

And if he had gone on being Prime Minister lots of other things would have subceeded succeeded

but as it was it left a very nasty taste

and it 's a curious way in which that Honours List seems to have echoed almost more than anything else in his in his second premiership

But was there a sense Roy Jenkins in which he was a lonely man that he actually I mean some of these people he did know they were on the fringe of his kitchen cabinet and he wasn't perhaps uh quite as uh good at sort of knowing the great and the good as other Prime Ministers have been

Yes I think there may be something in that

I mean he had a close kitchen cabinet around him

but he I would regard him as being a lonely man in in many ways

and I think he he slightly left liked the company who weren't themselves very secure 

and I 've always taken the view that r r relationships he had with people who weren't perhaps tremendously savoury I don't know whether this makes it better or worse they weren't because of any corrupt relationship in my view

but they were because he rather liked their company

But curiously

for one or two of the names at any rate on that honours list were people he he he scarcely knew himself 

so it doesn't quite fit fit into that  uhm that scenario

Yes that is true

Mm

Here we are

Yes

See he hardly knew uh James Goldsmith 

He 'd only met him twice

Mm

No no no

Yeah

Well let 's come on to just the final uh sort of thing left behind

and that cook took some time I think to emerge

but there were all these allegations that there had been a plot by the security services against Harold Wilson

Now this one has run and run Joe Haines

Do you attach any credence to it at all do you think

None none at all

If we are talking about a plot by some senior executive or masterminded by some senior executive in the security services then I think it 's rubbish from beginning to end

I 've never excluded the possibility that some of these I suppose you 'd call crypto-fascists now uh who might be sitting around waiting for a spy scandal to develop uh might in the uh the early hours of the morning talk rubbish and uh dream their dreams of a a takeover uh

but beyond that any idea that the security services were deliberately seeking to bring down the Prime Minister uh I give absolutely no credence to

I don't want to embarrass you Lord Jenkins but you were of course were at the Home Office at the time uhm

don't want you to tempt you to break any oath or anything like that

but were you aware that there was this such a thing as this going on

I was totally unaware of anything of this sort going on

and uhm w w first of all I I don't believe that anything to do with uhm security issues or you know approach to a security scandal had the slightest thing to do with Harold Wilson 's resignation

Uhm I dismiss that absolutely from my mind

I think he was of a settled mind about resigning early really for for quite a long way back

I think had he won the nineteen seventy election he would have resigned in nineteen seventy-two or nineteen seventy-three

I then rather forgot about it though thenber I remember

I mean he told me that at the time that this was his intention

and then when I think he came back in through the front door of Ten Downing Street he was pretty determined that he wasn't going to stay more than about two years

Everybody found it rather difficult to believe because he was thought to be such a professional politician to his fingertips that he would never voluntarily give up politics

but I believe that he had been of a settled mind on on this issue and that he really didn't want to stay on

and if one wanted to be cruel about it

and th th there are many things in retrospect which I think are very pro-Wilson

And therefore I on the whole have become rather more pro-Wilson as I reflect about him

but what one can say on this if one want wants to be cruel was his great desire to get back into Downing Street was to have his tit for tat with Teddy Heath

and that having had it having walked through the front door of Downing Street on that second occasion there wasn't really very much he wanted to do when he got inside it except in due course to walk with dignity out of the back door or front door after a stated period

It was totally different from the atmosphere of the first government when successfully or unsuccessfully there was a pulsating a slightly febrile atmosphere

This was totally different and much calmer

Now on the security the individual security service point  uhm I 've never believed there was there was anything in it

I thought it was a product of Harold 's sometimes febrile imagination

but I must say in the course of uhm of things which came out in when was it in about eighty-six things of that sort while I don't for a moment believe that the leadership of M I Five was uhm was involved in what they have been accused of by by some people I believe there was a certain monkeying about going on at maybe middle levels

At any rate there may have been

and I think that the Prime Minister the present Prime Minister was quite wrong not to have a full enquiry about it

Well so much for what we might call the loose ends I suppose left behind by Wilson 's resignation which though it burst on the world with a thunderclap you all three seem to think was quite explicable in the terms of his own intentions

Am I right about that

But that 's certain

I mean in uh as a result of I might say uh talking to quite a number of people I 've certainly come across nothing uh or nothing of any significance which indicates other than that it was a well-planned well-considered resignation uh which he 's had in mind for a very long time

In that respect he was virtually unique in in not only British Prime Ministers but political leaders all over the world where you you know for some reason the obsession seems to involve wanting to go on for ever uhm

but the the unique uniqueness doesn't make it any the more I think clear

Well I think Roy was a little unfair I might say about uh uh tit for tat with Ted Heath because uh Harold 's overriding objective was to keep the party together

He really did feel that he could make  the Labour Party the natural party of government

The loss in nineteen seventy hit him a great deal  and also I think that he was aware too that there was a deterioration in him

Ah he said to me that uh the trouble is Joe that when uh  the old problems recur I reach for the old solutions and I don't have anything new to offer

I thought that was a very significant and perceptive remark from a man who claimed he had nothing new to offer

Well let 's leave that elegiac note on which the curtain came down and go back if we may to the beginning

Roy Jenkins could I ask you

in nineteen sixty-three was there a serious alternative to Harold Wilson being Gaitskell 's successor

or was his choice absolutely inevitable 

No I don't think it was absolutely inev inevitable

Uhm  he was a very strong candidate clearly

Uhm I don't for instance know I can't decide what would have happened had Callaghan not stood on the first ballot and George Brown therefore had a clear run against Harold Wilson

I think it quite likely and probably more likely than not that he would have got ahead on the first day that uhm th therefore had it been a two-horse race I think George Brown would have won and that Callaghan 's intervention probably did uhm did give the leadership to uhm to to to Harold Wilson

George Brown had an absolutely first-rate intellect strong personality and accompanying it of course appalling faults

Whether those faults would have been suppressed and the virtues would have developed in office I don't know

It would uh it would have been a great risk

He would have been a very different sort of Prime Minister

he would have been a more inspirational Prime Minister

he would have been a higher risk Prime Minister uhm

he uhm in my view had uhm better vision on the big issues than Harold Wilson

Mm

Mm

But in ret in retrospect would you vote for him again 

What issues do you

Uhm I would have regarded it as a very high probably I would have yes

I would have regarded it as a high risk

but I think there 's a good chance that he might have performed better as number one than he he did as number two  though sometimes he performed quite well as uhm as number two even

I remember at the time saying I was in America  and the minute I was sent back saying I was firmly but unenthusiastically for Brown and equal weight was to be given to both adverbs

B

What

It was your choice to retire wasn't it

Are you glad you have made that choice

Yes

Yes I am uhm sure it was right

Uh I could have retired earlier 

Uhm and there was a time when I thought I shall retire at the time of the Lambeth Conference

uh when uh you know uh internationally that was a very significant moment bringing people together and took a lot of my energy and time and planning

And it was rather a joyful moment 

But  in the end uh I was persuaded that some of the things that I 'd said we 'd have to cope with together uh I ought to try to see through 

And then there one or two people said uhm  nasty things about me

And that 's the sort of thing that makes one say well uhm I shall show them

I 'm not going to retire just because uh they speculate that uh I 'm so gloomy that I 'm throwing in the towel

That 's a little bit of uh how shall I put it uh uhm uh arrogance that has still got to be eliminated uh in my life

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Yeah



  Oh I don't think so

I don't think so



In nineteen forty-four you came here first when you were in the army

Can you remember that

Very vividly

We came here  on a wonderful uh summer 's day when Kent seems full of blossom

I was a soldier then

and uh  we were all  uh you know w waiting to go to Normandy

We were  uh quite full of ourselves uh

And yet somehow  the cathedral and all it stood for mastered us

And it was a wonderfully reverent service

And uh  I had the sense then that uh  it was it it it belonged to something  bigger than human  uhm conflict

And you know it 's seen it over the centuries come and go and alas it still sees it today

Uhm

Indeed indeed

But uhm you had no inkling that you 'd ever get here   

None  none at 

And uh  uh well uh you know i it was uh  just a a great memory

Uhm

and I think there were an awful lot of people who were quite cynical about being marched into church  but for whom as they look back on that moment now and have always looked back on that moment it was uh very much part of the uh uh uh human preparation for what we had to do

Particularly then

No

Uhm

For what you had to do

Nowadays uh all institutions uh you know are slightly suspect

I mean uh parliament the law police church

And I think as an institution uh we suffer

That 's why uhm I find a uh a great deal of interest in the Christian spirit what it means and what it could mean but disenchantment about institutions uh uh like archbishops living in palaces and so on

And that 's something we 've got to work through

Robert Runcie it 's it 's wonderful meeting you just at this point after ten years is it when you were just leaving St Albans 

And now you 're just leaving Canterbury

Yes

Just over

Just over ten years

Oh yes

That 's right

One of the things that you were very worried about

And I and I 'm more interested in you really this time 

Last time I was I was getting your views

And now we know so many of them because you 've been exposed to us to us uh for for a number of years

Than last time 

Yes

 yes that 's right 

And I 'm shuffling off now

And you 're shuffling off

Yes  

 an old Lancashire vicar

you know

when they asked him uh when oh all the great things uhm at uh his uh farewell  uhm meeting in the village hall he simply said uh uh let Kingdom come and my name perish 





Do you feel that 

Sometimes

Sometimes 

One other thing you said you were terribly worried about was when uh ten years ago uh by taking on this job was that you it was going to divorce you from something that uh really mattered to you your own popularity with people  because y you had always got on so well with people in your job hadn't you

and you liked human contact



Well

Yes uh uh

I think that uh w was  uh qu qu quite a serious change because uhm  I enjoyed being  a diocesan bishop as I 'd enjoyed being a parish priest because I enjoyed the encounter with people

And uh uh that 's true

And you 're made uhm Archbishop of Canterbury I think because you 're thought to have done a tolerably good job as a diocesan bishop

But it 's quite different because you 're you 're often distanced from people and your uh contacts with them tend to be fragmentary

You do have because uh you know I 'm at Canterbury and uh have a diocese uh some of the old uh ways

But you can't follow them up

Somebody meets you uhm over a cup of tea and a bun in a in a village hall and uh puts to you some personal problem

And y you know that it 's fatal for you to say well write to me about it and I 'll follow it up because  y you can't

You 've got to leave it

You 've got to say  talk to your vicar about it

He 'll help with this

Uhm

Uhm

That you missed

I missed that

That sort of work

Yes

And I still of course miss that

But uh I 've learnt uh uh other ways that uhm one 's got to try to use one 's talent for getting on with people

Yeah

Uhm

But have you found the job more stressful

You were warned weren't you in nineteen eighty about what the stress of that job was going to be like

Uhm has it been more or less stressful

Well it has been quite stressful

And and and the pressure 's been considerable

And uh nowadays you know I meet my contemporaries who 've uhm  been retired  for five or six years

and here am I actually working longer hours than I 've ever worked in my life

Uh I mean I go on t usually until midnight and I 

Well

well

sometimes that 's one thing that comforts me that some of my contemporaries who 've retired ten years don't  don't look as if they 've got younger on the basis of it

Yes

Uhm uhm yeah

Uhm

You look well on it

My father had a Church of Scotland background but uhm  he wasn't a churchgoer

And m my mother had a I think quite a romantic attachment to religion but uh didn't uh go as far as being a regular churchgoer

Uh

I went along with a friend and his girlfriend o on whom I I think I had some uh designs or intentions uh uhm uh uhm uhm to confirmation

And they said come along

And I had scarcely heard about confirmation then uh

But uh uh something happened as a result of all that

And I think that my faith springs from a feeling that uh  uh I 've experienced something uh in the life of the church

I 've been given something

Uh faith has been a gift for me

What do you think in you gives you the capacity

I mean it gave you the capacity when you were a captain in the tanks in the army

You have you seem to have a capacity for handling stress

I 'm glad you think so 

Do you think you have 

I don't know

You 'll have to tell me

Well things flutter inside me a bit uh of course

And you uh uh uhm put a good front on

Uh

I  uh suppose that I mean I had very happy early years with my  uh own family my mother and father in and and and in Liverpool

I l I  uh didn't have a particularly religious background but I had a very human background

And I was a great  I mean uh uh uhm my dad was a great hero to me

And my mother was a sort of comfort to me

And I think that that 's very important that basic thing 

Though uhm  there were two things that uh happened in uhm my life

I 've been rather interested to read uh the biographies about myself due to which I 've discovered all sort of things that I never knew

And uhm someone uh one person pointed out that uh  uh uh uh my mother went off uhm to be a hairdresser on an ocean liner when I was two 

Uhm 

 for six months 

Uh for six months yes

And I I was going to ask you about this

Uh but uh she had been of course uhm  a a hairdresser on an ocean liner

But she went back to it

And uh she went away once or twice in that respect

It seems amazing now that somebody I remember as so conventional should have been so ahead of her time in uh  in f uh female rights 

Oh

was that what it was

Well I don't know

Wouldn't be on principle

But uh  uh my father was a tremendous man 's man club man

He went to the club every night

I remember

and

uh 

uh

uh

uhm

uh I s

and a great man for sport and a racing man

and uh genial

you know

and uh clubbable

And uhm I suspect that this was an assertion of her independence too and uh 

I I always remember as a small boy  uh uh I knew  uh by the smell of Turkish cigarettes and the fact that I would get an enormous box of chocolates that uh some of Mum 's sailor friends were  we we were at home



Yes

Uhm and uh 

Well you married a strong woman too

I married a strong woman yes

And she 's uhm also a person of her own interests and her own uh uhm uhm independent personality

And uhm I think that that 's uh

But what I was going to say about uhm  uh about this interest and description of me which I 'd never thought about at all was it was suggested that some of my  uncertainties and some of my occasional sense of insecurity  uhm which I 've always admit admitted to inside was uhm due to being uh abandoned when I uh rather when I was young

And also I think the fact that my father went blind when I was uh in my teens that made a big difference

And those are two tr quite traumatic things that uh uh uh did uhm moderate the kind of sunshine of my life really

uhm

So I 've had enough sunshine to e enable me to stand the stress and perhaps a bit of an experience of desertion to stand the isolation

Well this is amazing self-analysis

And I don't know how accurate it is

Uhm

 uh uh

Uhm  indeed

Uhm

Well it sounds quite good  doesn't it

I mean

because I do think that there is something in people

I mean I want to know if you knew

And I want to know it every time I interview people that have made it in some way

and you have made it to the top of of your particular profession and and

what is it in you that 's different from the next man because there is something different in you 

Yeah

Yes

I suppose that  one uhm  thing I 've been uhm in so far as I 've been able to think about myself I 've been pondering

I think that when I was younger  because  you know I was quite successful and I went from uhm  uh from uh uh uh school s s scholarship boy at school to university and then into the army and then in into the church

and you moved which uhm however much you might say modestly

well

you know

it 's what God wants me to do

and I tried to think like that with promotion things 

Uhm  eh uh I think when I was younger I was more self-confident and arrogant and perhaps ruthless you know uhm o o on the surface but quite a softie underneath 

And I think perhaps uhm  uh being in a position where  uhm a lot of people don't think you 're a success because you often have to stand up for things which people uh uhm regard as wrong

Or in trying to see both sides of a situation people say uh why have we got to be led by this ditherer and all that sort of uh stuff you see

And uh you know there are people who never say that you said anything you always bleated something you know and uh you were never trying to be wi with the times you were a trendy clergyman you know

Usual clich&eacute;s you see

But uhm that actually  has made me I think uhm  stronger inside having to deal with that but perhaps gentler  uh on the outside

Uhm

Uhm uhm

On the outside

Have you recovered from last night the Comic Relief experience

Uh uh yes

It was a a longish night uhm but a satisfactory one in many ways

Uhm we don't know what obviously what what the total raised is yet

But uhm crikey it was a good time 

Well said  

Now Jeeves and Wooster is about to burst upon us again

Why is that golden age s so popular today 

Well that 's

Uh I don't know if it 's the age

Uh I mean I would I would hope really that the  that the big attraction is the books themselves which are terribly funny

But although you 're right you see Poirot is is almost exactly the same age

Uhm in actual fact when when shooting Jeeves and Wooster we 're constantly bumping into the Poirot crew and using the same sort of nineteen twenties taxis and the same nineteen twenties extras

In fact you 'll probably see the same extras appearing in both shows uhm

In fact I was the the only person not to do both

Uhm but I I don't know really what it is

It 's You know they 've got lovely suits and lovely cars and uh

But I hope for for Jeeves and Wooster I just hope it 's funny

My wife is a great fan of the books

She 's She 's always saying do you want some bread and B and things like that

Yes

Well it it uh because it is very florid uh s language

Uhm we have o on when shooting the thing a lot of the crew who are fairly uh I wouldn't say foul-mouthed but you know they have their own rich Anglo-Saxon way of putting things uh would often take on this uh this wonderful language in in

When dropping a spanner on their foot it would be uh oh heck or or dash it 

Oh bother 

I 've gone and dropped the on my f foot

Oh bother

Yeah

What is the worst expletive you 've come across in the in the books

Uhm  tchah 

Well heck is pretty strong  

Heck is not to be used over-liberally you know

You You would save it for maybe a couple of hecks in a show because you don't want people writing in obviously

Well it is four letters after all

That 's right

Uhm there is one I particularly remember of of Bertie leaving a room uh after an argument

Uh he 's sort of lost the argument

and he stands in the doorway

and he says

tinketytonk

I said

and I meant it to sting

oh  

Which is just so sweet I mean it is

It is quite powerful stuff

I 'll tell you what

Let 's refresh our memories of of Jeeves 's skill at saving Bertie 's bacon

Righty-ho

But you 're a bit of a Bertie Wooster yourself

I mean Eton and Cambridge and all that

Bit posh isn't it

Well it 's uh pfff

Yes I suppose so uhm

I ha I am Bertie Wooster

That 's absolutely right

It 's a sort of  Yes Jeeves and Wooster is is a sort of fly-on-the-wall documentary really uhm as much as a drama series

More than a drama series uhm

And that is exactly uhm that is the life I lead

and it 's just a question of where you put the camera in the room you know as I 'm going about my uhm

Did you You read anthropology

Did you find that useful

I didn't really I didn't really read anthropology

I mean officially I did

It says on the

But I didn't really

T Have I found it useful

Well if I had read it uhm I 'm sure it would have been absolutely fascinating uhm  

They tell me it 's a gripping subject uhm

Oh

But you didn't graduate with honours then

Uh I haven't graduated at all actually uhm 

It 's actually still in the post uhm   ten years later

I 'm what 's called a graduand 

Uh that doesn't mean anything to me either

Sort of pending graduate is it

Yeah that 's right

Yes I 'm in the s in the pending tray

And I apparently have to go down there and uh sign on the line and have a lunch and uh put on a gown if I ever want it you know uhm

Uhm

But you were there for other reasons then were you

Well yes yes I was

That 's right

Uhm I uh well I went there to row

I 'll I 'll be blunt with it uh because it didn't

it 's been ten years

and I think the admissions tutor can take it now uhm   because obviously I had to lie uhm th you know when I was applying through my teeth uh

But that 's where it really what I want uh uh went for and anthropology was the most convenient subject to read uh while spending eight hours a day on the river 

Yes

But nevertheless though I mean Cambridge was very productive and all that

That was where you gave Stephen his showbiz start

Uhm

I 'd

Uh yes absolutely

Uh everything he has he owes to me uh

Cos you were   president

About seven pounds eighty I think

Yeah

Yes

In Bertie money

Yes

Yes

Stephen confessed here about his prison record

Your life has been blameless

Uh  dull

Dull is the word 

I sometimes wonder whether Stephen actually went to prison  deliberately in order to have something to talk about when he came on this show  

And I feel uh I 'm feeling the loss now

Uh I mean we could make something up obviously

But uh you know gunrunning to Iraq I don't know

But no s it wouldn't wash because I I 've had a very uhm pretty straightforward sort of a life I 'm afraid

Well you hinted at international intrigue then

You were in in America uh in Washington weren't you at the time of the Gulf deadline

Yes we were

Yes

And a very interesting story behind that 

It had better be

Uh we uh  

Yes we

Because Jeeves and Wooster had just shown uh in America as part of this thing called Masterpiece Theatre which is where they watch all uh all E English drama sort of Upstairs Downstairs and Brideshead and all that sort of thing

And they were celebrating twenty years of Masterpiece Theatre

And they invited us over to this huge great thing

and one one of them was a was a was a dinner in the State Department  uh wi full of all these uhm brass hats and ambassadors and you know  who knows what

And I sat next to President Bush 's daughter 

Yes ladies and gentlemen  

Uh well I mean it 's worth worth a mention uhm

And uh she she actually showed them over the next day showed us round round the White House which which we had not been able to get into the day before because of peace demonstrations going on outside

And she took us round it

It was it was very exciting

We passed ten feet from the Oval Office where President Bush was sucking his pen and tossing a coin and going oh God you know am I which it oh it turns out he 'd done six months before

But you know th th at that time we still believed it you know 

Talking of powerful leaders uh there is more Blackadder to come I hope

It 's it 's not dead forever

Please don't tell me that

Uhm 

Well it 's ooh looks a bit like it

Yes

although at least if it 's going ahead I don't know anything about it which is probably the most likely uhm course of events

uhm

But uh no it I don't think there will be

I 'm I It 's not for me to say 

But I think that the wri uh Ben Elton and Richard Curtis who wrote it sort of felt that you know maybe quit quit while they 're ahead

Uhm

Uhm

Well it was glorious stuff

You mentioned Ben

Did he Have you spoken to him about his Robin Day experience

I Within an hour of it happening

On this show He

Yes he was absolutely staggered by it

His chin was on the floor

I 've never seen his chin on the floor before in fact

It was broken in fact by then

Uhm it was he was absolutely staggered by it

And uh I think he 's gone a bit bonkers hasn't he to be honest Robin Day

I don't know I mean I y you you you sat next to the man

But uhm  he looks a bit out of his tree to me uh  

I mean he obviously thinks that he is a he is a lovable eccentric and anything he does people will go oh bless him and

I just thought what the heck

You know press charges I would say

Uh get your solicitor on the phone the next day

But we 've it was uhm it 's been quite useful

as a way of getting Ben to shut up is that we can actually say

you know

shut up now

shut up  

I 'm talking will you shut up in that 



Yes 

Extraordinary

Well I 'm glad you 're able to

But you meet them all don't you here

I see it all violence sex drugs drink

It all happens right here 

Yeah yes absolutely

Soon

Yes any minute now  

We 'll have a commercial break soon and then we 'll do it

Right

But uhm I didn't no notice by the way anything in your b biography Hugh about singing

Uh do you warble 

T uhm To myself yes

I uh I am in fact nervous

I 've I have occasionally warbled in public

Uhm it 's a pretty terrifying affair

I 've nothing but admiration for people who can who can do it

But I 'm not an experienced voice

Uhm uhm

Well I 'm not going to ask you to now  because uh that slot is occupied by my next guest whom I will now introduce

Good good

We have John uh two paperbacks in Penguin

One is Rumpole &agrave; la Carte six new stories which we see on television this autumn

The other is the paperback of Titmus Regained a sequel to Paradise Postponed also in fact coming up on television quite soon

And this one uh will be your first ever independent production

Yes it is

I mean I think that 's what 's happening in this s you know among the uh revolutions that are going in the television world is that television companies don't want to employ people all the year round not to work

so everything is going to be done with independent productions

And for the first time in my life we 're doing Titmus Regained sort of three uh three hours of television uh with a company my company and that of my producer who 's done all my plays a lady called Jackie Davis

And we 've got the money

And of course it 's a terrible change in life

I mean when I was spending other people 's money I used to go out take people out to expensive lunches you know and bottles of champagne were opened

Now they 're very very lucky if they get a Diet Coke and  slice of pizza

But how did you manage to raise the money for this yourself

Well it all comes from Thames  B

But they wanted us to do it as an independent production

So it 's all Thames 's money

But at least it 's the first our first experience of doing an independent production

And what is nice is you can hire all the people you like and

And it will again be David Threlford playing Leslie Titmus

David Threlford plays Titmus again

Remind us for those of us who who 've uh not forgotten Paradise Postponed but perhaps missed the television or the the first book

He is the M P

Mm

Yeah

Well t Leslie Titmus is the sort of was the sort of real Thatcherite uh  little working class boy in the village who rose without trace and took the Conservative Party away from the old knights of the shires who were running it in that particular area of England where I live and uh became the local M P and uh behaved in a more or less ruthless fashion and is a sort of gritty aggressive uh down-market Conservative of whom you can probably think of a few 

And he was played by David Threlford very brilliantly I think

David Threlford had made his name by being Smike in uh Nicholas Nickleby

John Major they say that Michael Heseltine has charisma

Douglas Hurd has a safe pair of hands

What would you like them to say about you

Tha That he won  uh and I hope at some stage next week they 'll be able to say that

It 's perfectly true uh that Michael has char charisma

I think that 's right

He 's a very glamorous very attractive politician 

but I 'm bound to say there are a whole series of things that one has to consider when one 's examining matters to do with the leadership of the Conservative Party

Charisma is certainly one  policy is another  the ability to unite the party

There are a whole series of ingredients for discussion

Our colleagues will have to make their choice next week

You are obviously an extremely ambitious man

Is it wise however to run against two such senior and very experienced politicians for the highest office

Oh well let me take both those points uh at once

What is the very most basic tenet of the Conservative Party 

I would suggest to you that it is choice

What we have put before our colleagues in the Conservative Party is a choice between three candidates all of whom have presented themselves to their colleagues to be leader of the party

Let the party actually operate its basic belief

But you 're not running to give a choice

you 're running to win

Of course I 'm running to win

and so are my colleagues

but it is entirely right for us to do so that the party may choose which of us is best suited to lead the Conservative Party in the future

Well let 's look at your e experience

You 've been in high office now only three years or so

You came out of the Whip 's office

You really are relatively speaking in comparison with the other two very inexperienced however talented you may be

Well let me let me pick up that point

Uh

firstly you define experience if I may say so in the narrow confines of just experience in politics

so let us take experience within politics and beyond

There is you know a life beyond politics

There is experience in what has happened elsewhere in life what else one has done both at home and abroad

There 's a wealth of experience there that all three candidates have that is also worth examining

Within the Conservative Party you say I 'm inexperienced 

I 'm bound to say I 'm very happy to measure that experience against Mr Kinnock 's experience or Mr Ashdown 's experience who will presumably be leaders of the other parties

Yes but has been measured in the sense of being measured against your two colleagues

No no

in the sense  

well as to experience in the Conservative Party I 've been in the Conservative government now for eight years

I 've had experience in Home Departments in the Central Department of Economics and Social Ser Services and Social Security  so often the battleground of the general election

I 've had experience in the Whip 's office across a whole range of departments  and I think I 'm entitled to put uh uh what I have learned as a basis of that before my colleagues and they 'll decide

Now the your electorate and the broader electorate will easily be able to imagine Michael Heseltine or Douglas Hurd sitting across the table from Chancellor Kohl from President Bush from Mr Gorbachev

Are you really saying to them that you can handle that situation as well as those two experienced people can

The last time I heard that question asked of a candidate for leadership it was asked of Margaret Thatcher

so I think people just see what happened subsequently

Yeah there is a difference

Margaret Thatcher had been by that time leader of her party for nearly four years

She 'd already established her reputation as the Iron Lady hadn't she

I don't think Margaret Thatcher had eight years ' experience in government 

I 've had eight years of government

Let people choose

let them make up their minds

There is this stuffy attitude you know not just in politics but beyond  that somebody must wait another two or three years

perhaps they can do it then

That 's one of the attitudes not just in politics but in business in the civil service in industry and commerce that we ought to root out

If people are good enough they 're old enough

Let them get on with it

There 's a wealth of talent in the country we really need to unblock

Uncork that talent and let it get on with the job

OK you say you you 're good enough

If you become Prime Minister it is quite conceivable that it would be under circumstances when the Gulf crisis is deteriorating and you could be charged with making life and death decisions for the citizens of this country 

Are you confident that it would not be better for someone like Douglas Hurd to be making those final decisions

Well uh  I think there is no difference in the policy that we follow towards the Gulf 

Well hang on then

let me pursue the answer

Uh there will be no difference in policy whether it is uh Douglas who is Prime Minister Michael or whether it is me

There is absolute unity that what has happened there is unforgivable and that it has to be reversed

I know it is not your question but I will come to your question if in my own way and and a a and with the right background

If it is necessary to make the appropriate decisions I believe I can make them

People said to me as you 've just done in every job I 've had in Government

have you the experience to do it

can you sit across the table they said when I became Chief Secretary with Willie Whitelaw and others sitting the other side and negotiate a spending round satisfactorily

That 's what people said to me when I became Chief Secretary some years ago

I think people now see that that was quite possible and it happened

That 's clear

that 's well known

Yes

That 's something I

It is quite different with respect to be making decisions about public spending however difficult those negotiations might be however tough you have to be from making very quick decisions in time of war when thousands of lives are at stake

Let me just press this point with you a little further

Uh you will be speaking

or you may have to speak for the nation in a time of supreme crisis negotiating at the top level

I put it to you again that Douglas Hurd under those circumstances must be regarded as more qualified if only by experience for that task

I If you 're seeking to attract me to say anything about Douglas that is ungracious you will fail for I have the highest possible respect for Douglas as a close friend and as a very experienced colleague

No doubt he would equally be a very experienced colleague were he to be uh Foreign Secretary in a government led either by Michael or myself

so his experience will still be available

But let me put it to you this way 

Three hundred and seventy-two of my colleagues know each of us extremely well

House of Commons is like a village as you well know

They know our strengths our weaknesses our capacity to remain cool our capacity to deal with problems

They are perhaps better placed than anybody to make a judgement as to who could best cope with those sets of circumstances

and they know the problems in the Gulf

and  they know they know what they know what may need to be decided in the Gulf

and I have no doubt that will weigh on their minds when they make their decisions next week

They know early to ask

It 's not too early to ask you

And you would be surprised if they concluded that it was too much to ask of you at this stage in your career

I uh uh uh have placed myself before them for them to make that judgement

I am confident that I can deal with the problems uh of Prime Minister were I to be elected uh leadersh leader of the Conservative Party

but it is for others to make the judgement

If I didn't think I could have done the job I would not have let my name go forward for the job

Now uh uh uh they also say of you that you 're a very nice that you have no enemies quite rare in politics uh but that the public man lacks charisma the public man is grey

In the world of bright lights in which politicians have to operate isn't that a drawback

I think uh they said something similar about William Pitt uh who also had the disadvantage of being only twenty-three when he became chancellor only half my age exactly 

but he certainly didn't have television

that is absolutely true

but important though television is actually governing the country seemed to be to be a bit more than a a a particular television manner

But with the advantage of television to appear on

But you 've got to be able to sell  as well

Well uh I very much believe that I can sell

We shall see

People think selling somehow involves some particularly uh some particular skill

I think what people 

Doesn't it

Well let me finish the ans answer

Doesn't it

I thought that was what we I thought it did

Let me develop the point if I may Jonathan

Yes it does

it does require a particular skill but it requires something else as well 

It actually requires someone who knows what it is that people in the country are concerned about and what they actually feel about issues who actually knows and understands the problems that they face

Now I think that over the years a breadth of experience outside politics and inside politics has equipped me to understand many of those concerns so I believe I can do it

But my colleagues will decide

I 'm not going to breast beat about it

They will make a decision and I will abide by that decision

Of course

But of But of course of course of course they will and of course you will too

it 's self-evident

The the The fan club that supports you your supporters who wa want you make an enormous amount of your classless background as if somehow being classless makes you better equipped to be Prime Minister

No it makes me neither better equipped nor worse equipped

and I think the point that they may be making is that it doesn't make me worse equipped to be Prime Minister

It is the ability to do the job that matters not where you come from or what you are

It is the the ability to do the job what you know what you believe and what you believe you can do

So that is your special advantage that you are from your particular uhm

That is  what I shall 

Jonathan I am not claiming special advantages

You 're inviting me to claim special advantages

I am making the point that the Conservative Party in my judgement has three excellently qualified candidates and they will make a judgement as to which of those candidates most suit their preferences to be leader of their party

Sure but the reason why I invited you is because I thought you wanted to be at Morden and felt that the party ought to have you rather than them but uh of course it 's up to them

Uh you also say

and you seem to make much of it

and I quote you

I want to make sure the Conservative Party is open to everyone whatever their background whatever their interests whatever their creed

Uhm uh uh

is there anyone who doesn't want that for the Conservative Party who 's a member of it

Uh I hope everybody does want it and I hope everybody is going to continue to develop it 

The nature and structure of the Conservative Party in the last decade or so has changed dramatically

People who ten or fifteen years ago would never have identified with the Conservative Party are not only members of it they 're members of Parliament in the Conservative Party and in the highest echelons of the party machine

Now that has to be continued 

We need to uh continue to broaden that appeal across every aspect of the community

The Labour Party have traded on class distinction class war against the Conservatives almost incessantly since the nineteen thirties

In the last ten years much of that has broken down

Some of it still remains

We have to attack it and say to everybody in this country whatever they feel wherever they come from if they share the beliefs that we have in the Conservative Party then they we don't only re uh uh hope that they will vote for us

we want them actually to come and join us work with us and help shape our policy

That is the point that I 'm making

Four singers with standard comic opera roles a Pierrot a Colombina a Pantalone and so on run out of music and tussle with a composer with a singer from serious opera and the composer 's father who thinks he should be earning his living in a more responsible way

The staging by Francisco Negrin and designer Anthony Baker wittily plays off the opera house and its conventions finally allowing us to glimpse a three tier gilt and scarlet plush auditorium into which the cast make their escape

All that 's missing is a passionate eighteenth-century story line

The critic Lynne Walker

The first ten minutes of the opera consist of the overture and ensemble from Mozart 's uh aborted project The Deluded Husband

I really found myself enjoying the first ten minutes and then suddenly everything seemed to disintegrate which is the plot uhm as the characters try to find new identities and they turn to the composer for these identities

The composer asks them to be shadows

And after a while I found it very difficult to identify with any of the characters on stage

Well you can't really identify with a shadow

And therefore I found it very difficult to actually get involved in what was going on

I don't really find that with an opera normally

So I don't think as an opera it really works in that sense

It doesn't really have any emotional content does it and and that 's essential to opera

None at all

And I I also felt that apart from lacking emotion it lacked humour as well

There were some amusing moments

but I felt that we were starting to laugh at opera singers popping their heads through curtains and uh little songs where you could almost hear Gilbert and Sullivan 's patter songs coming through

I didn't really feel there was any genuine warmth and vitality in it

It all seemed to me a little bit contrived

Was it refreshing to hear the music itself there and see it staged

Is it is it music which as Paul Griffiths says is a series of showstoppers

Is it Mozart on top form

Yes there are

there are some lovely moments where there are shades of The Magic Flute and echoes of Don Giovanni and perhaps the odd oboe melody or brass chord where you thought

uhm

really vintage Mozart

I suppose the cynic would say that this has been put together from clippings from the cutting room floor

I think that 's probably a little bit hard but there is a grain of truth in that

I didn't really sit bolt upright at any moment and think goodness me I must get hold of the music for this I must hear this again

Did you think it well performed by the company of seven on stage

I thought it was mixed

I thought there was some lovely singing from the ladies

Mary Haggerty as Colombina the commedia del arte heroine I thought she sang beautifully

Uh Jennifer Rees Davis had a terribly difficult job

She was singing the role of the opera seria character the singer and she 'd very difficult runs and a very high tessitura very sort of Queen of the Night stuff

I thought she was very brave and I thought it was fine

Uh I thought Pamela Helen Stephen as the composer in the breeches part wasn't terribly at ease with her role and she was better when she was standing still and singing uhm as she did at the end

And it was a lovely sound

I thought the men were rather less good

It is a f rather eccentric way to celebrate the bicentenary but interesting

Yes

I think uh Opera North is always inventive

It 's always interesting

I think Opera North jumped the bicentenary gun a couple of years ago because they gave the musical world the opportunity to reassess La Finta Giardiniera

and I think they probably thought

this year what on earth are we going to do

I don't think  this was perhaps the best thing they could have done

It 's very interesting to see and I think people ought to go and see it because they 'll hear music they won't normally hear they won't hear it again

I don't think opera companies are going to rush to take this up when bicentenary fever has died down

I think they 'll want to do the real thing

I don't think we can get enough of the real Mozart operas

Claire Tomalin you 've been listening to that uh discussion  I had with Chris Powling

And I think the truth of the matter is that we both enjoyed the play uh very considerably but had those reservations about it

And I won I wonder whether you did take a conscious decision to leave Middleton Murry out or or or whether it 's it 's the usual thing that you know cast of four is about what could be afforded and so on

No

I was fascinated by your conversation 

I wrote an early draft of the play which had Murry in  and I deliberately took him out 

This is something I found in writing biography too that the gaps can be the most interesting part the most challenging part

Maybe I haven't made it work

Maybe his absence is is not properly dealt with

In a way I suppose the doctor  in some curious sense becomes a sort of surrogate for Murry

He 's a sort of nice version of what Murry might have been if Murry had been nice and if he 'd been there

But I very deliberately confined the action to one place really well the the the South of France and very deliberately excluded Murry

He is meant to be th the absent figure

I wonder if coming to theatre from the more pure  activity of biography the factual activity this kind of problem  uh surprised you intrigued you

I think drama fiction may be more pure than biography because I think the challenge is so much greater

I 've never written any fiction before

and the idea for this play came to me very slowly

and in a sense I found myself over a period of years listening to the voices of Katherine Mansfield and listening to the voice of Ida Baker

I met Ida Baker

I heard her voice

I met Katherine 's sister her youngest sister Jeanne and spent a day with her

She 's dead now

And I felt that I heard the Beauchamp voice

Beauchamp was the family name of Mansfield

I had a tape recording of Katherine Mansfield 's  New Zealand girlfriend Mrs Robertson made when she was over a hundred

I listened and listened to that

So I felt that these voices were sort of growing in my imagination

And then when I decided to try and write the play  I did feel that they sort of took off and spoke for themselves

That sounds pretentious and sounds ridiculous

Whatever people think about journalists serious journalists actually have quite a big threshold to cross I think when they first actually make things up as opposed to reporting them 

It 's intoxicating

It really is intoxicating

I 've said somewhere it 's a bit like flying a kite

I think you feel there 's something pulling you up into the sky

you don't quite know what it is

And what about the experience of being  reviewed in this context as as someth something

you 've obviously been reviewed before as a biographer

but being reviewed for a work of fiction 

Being reviewed 

Uh it 's a bit like being a bomb disposal person I think opening up the papers looking for reviews 

It 's very very nerve-racking 

I think you have to accept that some people won't like your work 

And if some people do like it it 's so unbelievable it 's so so pleasing uh to feel that you have reached someone

I don't think it 's very different between biography and fiction

To feel something you have written has reached someone is what matters











We thought that uh ethics was really fundamental to giving high quality patient care

And so we were very lucky indeed to have a statutory body agree for us to have five hundred hours of ethics and politics for our nursing course

Five hundred over the over three years of the course

Over the three years

Yes

That 's quite a lot isn't it

It is

I think it 's more than any other college of nursing has been lucky enough to have

It 's also more than most medical students would get over a much longer course too I think isn't it

Oh it 's much more because medical education in ethics is very ad hoc

It just centres round having uhm set piece uh uh situations like uhm abortion and uh euthanasia and so on

But we have decided that we will teach the fundamentals of uh ethics

so they have the principles really of respect for persons and human wellbeing and how human beings make decisions and so on

and so that we can then build on the special health care components of the ethics course 

So it 's much more systematic

I presume a lot of it takes the form of of lectures discussions and seminars throughout the three years

Oh it does indeed

The whole thing is based on a lecturer reading a paper for about half an hour and then seminar groups discussing the topics uh and relating them to nursing as such in the hospital and in the community

And the students also keep diaries of their clinical experiences which must include ethical issues which are then brought back into the college and discussed  in seminar groups again and in in big uh plenary sessions

Say a little bit more about these these diaries

They would listen the students would keep uh a record of what it is that 's going on whether it be routine mundane day by day things or something out of the ordinary

Well

if it be routine things like for instance if a patient says to them I want to die nurse  or I don't want that operation nurse that the doctor wants me to have

well they will then talk about really what happened how we took up these problems with the patient and uhm uh the ethical issues that should have been raised at the time by the nurses uh and the doctors and taken into consideration

And we do hope in that way to improve the quality of care and to improve uh patient autonomy and choice and what actually happens to them

So this means that the uh the kind of teaching and discussions that nurses have are rooted very much in their own experience

Mm

Oh absolutely 

It also means presumably that the the course is constantly changing dep depending on what issues the students themselves have experienced and raised

Oh it does

And they 're bringing up most interesting issues that we really uh never imagined would be happening especially now that the students are going out into the areas of mental handicap into the community

And we 're getting a wide arena of issues that occur with the uh community services with the new G P practices and so on

And therefore issues arising out of the White Paper that the Government has just produced are are coming up to the forefront

And what about the the students themselves

Do they see the value of this or are they slightly bemused by the emphasis you give to to this topic here

Well they were slightly bemused at the beginning

And I can remember one nurse saying to me what has Aristotle got to do with nursing 

And it 's quite interesting to follow them up now because when you ask them now do you now realise what Aristotle has got to do with nursing uh and they say yes we can see that Aristotle did say we 've got to use our rationality and our emotions to make better decisions for our patients

What is the exact mixture do you think that brought forth Derek Jarman the the artist into the world because you are a are a product of the the famous British public school system for one thing uh and then you went to art school and then you went into costume and set design

And all this happened really before you started picking up a camera and becoming a movie maker

Well it 's the you know I I became a movie maker after several years ' work in in other areas uh

I I never saw myself as a costume designer

it was just that at the Slade it was a a place where you could work on a communal project whereas as a painter you worked for yourself by yourself in a corner

In the theatre design department there which I did as my ancillary course uh you were given say Prokofiev 's Prodigal Son some you know a ballet or something like this

and we all worked on it together

so you could actually discuss what you were doing with the other students

I that 's what I liked about it

And o oddly enough it 's what I liked about the cinema eventually is i

you know there was a group of people making it really rather than one individual

Uhm I think I was always uhm nervous of my own painting

I di I I never felt that that it quite made the grade whatever that might be

I I mean other people liked it but uh I felt it was it it failed somewhere and I was actually rath rather pleased to have this other one as a bolt hull hole really 

What what was the exact sort of sequence uh in terms of the creation of your style in terms of moving on from costume and set design

I mean I know you went in terms of career you went via Ken Russell 's The Devils on which you designed the sets

But I 'm interested in in the way sort of set design and and costume idea motifs are being carried through into your films as a film maker cos there 's a strong element almost uhm I mean not in an infantile sense but of dressing up i i in your movies isn't there of of putting on different guises o of dressing up certain well-known myths in in different guises and so on

Yes

Yes yes

Yes

Yes

Oddly enough I saw it as dressing down really  because I 'm  w watchdogs

and you saw people who were dressed up

and I I ha you know I had t t this grounding in theatre design

And so i you know even on a film like The Tempest it was actually to explode that whole idea of design concept uhm it might be called and to put people into the costumes of any period really but the costumes you felt that they might wear

And I I suppose later on in this particular film in The Garden the new film uhm it is quite like uh a dressing up box

and I quite like that

It is rather like kids in the attic

It has uh  a slightly naive quality in that in that area

I think it 's something I on the other hand I look at design films and they they seem to have you know

I always think of them as the sort of Christmas cake th that 's got the wrapping round it and all that people have done is put a sort of pretty wrapping 

Uh uhm the design comes from within my films in a way that I I don't see in other British cinema actually 

Wh wh in what way is it related to I

I mean you haven't exactly uh uhm concealed the fact that you 're gay from film-goers and film critics

I mean in what way is it related to that

I mean not just in terms of the sort of clich&eacute; thing thing thing of uh you know gays like to put on disguises of various kinds but also in the fact that the themes of your movies are very much self-portraits kind of obliquely disguised uhm

I mean you 've got the theme of homosexuality  uh in the guise of Romans versus Christians in Sebastian or in the guise of the New Testament in The Garden 

Yes yes

Yeah

Well in I would have thought that culture is homosexual

I mean it 's as simple as that

If you read uh the first speech in Edward the Second as I have been cos we 're going to make that into a film Gaveston 's  description of the King of England as being interested in plays and masques and poetry uh uh immediately makes him as far as I can uh see in the eyes of most people who read that play effeminate 

It 's quite interesting that uhm 

Does it really

Of course it doesn't uh but there is a way of reading it like that

How legitimate is it I mean I think perhaps what I 'm getting at is

let 's take The Garden

how legitimate do you think it is for a particular vested interest and doesn't matter whether it 's homosexuality or anything else to hijack the iconography of something like Christianity for its own purposes

yes yes

Well I think uh yes I think that that 's been done in The Garden

It 's very complicated

I think one of the things about uh uhm being openly gay in the cinema in this country meant that you had accepted certain limitations financially

and  I na I mean I I knew after I 'd made Sebastian that there wasn't much chance of going to Hollywood even if I 'd wanted to 

Did did you want to

No I didn't because  I was too interested in my own life

Another great conflict in the whole all of this was to you know during those decades the sixties and the seventies to discover uh just how I I should lead my life

If you think it was a whole generation doing that a whole generation of y of young gay men and women

And uh that was much more important than any work that I could do that sort of that coming to terms with my sexuality and 

That doesn't really

I mean I never had a career

You mention the word career

I have to say I never had a career

I n didn't even have a career in Ken Russell 's films

I was just the artist

I wasn't the designer

If I ever was anything I was a painter

I consistently maintained the illusion that I was a painter 

The p tradition in painting is very much for  the artist to reveal himself or the artist to reveal his own attitude or perspective very explicitly to what he 's seeing or painting whereas the feature film is much more a collective art

It 's for the e entertainment of the audience at large

Is this anything other than a matter of economics

or do you think there 's something intrinsic about the form of the feature film that 's different from say painting

Well I think painting 's a much more sophisticated medium and uh so is theatre in the sense they 've got a longer tradition

And of course money does a handicap in in a way that it doesn't

I mean what might seem radical in cinema is in no way radical in the theatre

Uhm the cinema in a way is like children 's bedtime stories you kn you know

And it always seemed that way to me

Just simple really whereas there was something much more complex

If you looked for instance at twentieth-century painting it got very very far away from the children 's bedtime stories that you might equate with the pre-Raphaelites

you know the li the uhm Light of the World or The Howling Shepherd

It seemed to me that the cinema was stuck in a way in the nineteenth century in an a very odd way

And also not only in  its the necessity it seems to have to tell these stories but also in terms of the way it views people

Very extraordinary

I mean the the way Mr Griffiths fastens on his heroines and the camera from that moment on exploits women in a particular way right the way through the whole of cinema up to this day

Very rarely has that been uh as it were subverted

I mean Pasolini was one of the few people who did and actually turned his camera round onto the young men uh

It 's very hierarchical the cinema

It uh that 's one of the reasons why I ran up from The Devils set really at the end because it seemed to me well that no one I just couldn't fit in

I mean it was so far away from the world in London that I was living in of painters like Hockney and people like that to walk in t to Pinewood Studios 

It was hierarchical

I mean Ken Russell was expected to walk through a door before you

It was like the king

And I remembered when I first went out that I walked in through the doors in Pinewood before him

I just happened to be in that relationship

And I uhm I suddenly realised that everyone was walking behind him

It was like that sort of surgeon in the Hollywood movie rushing through the corridors with all the nurses behind 

Wh wh what what is collective activity on the Jarman set like

I mean clearly the same sort of rigid hierarch hierarchies don't obtain

But uhm are you very much the uh the the person in charge or as I understand from some reports about The Garden uhm you 've con con confessed that a lot of the film was shot by other people and indeed edited by other people

I I I think in this particular film I was  not in control of it in the way that you would be in the traditional feature film

I think I I intervene in certain areas where I I suppose areas that I I think or under the illusion that I know more uh

I s you know one of the reasons why I was able to make all these low-budget films was the realisation after The Devils that if you put a film in one place  you save money and you could do it quickly

And some people have said oh well the films are very say claustrophobic in a way

Well this is necessitated by the budget

And I would get scripts from people which would  say

and he walked out the door and down Oxford Street

and you 'd think

forget it

I mean you 'd this is not my area

You have to have to retreat into Stoney Abbey or the island in Sardinia or uh

We 're going to have a very small set I think at Brave for Edward 

And where

I I don't know about my control of the thing so it 's very difficult

I think it 's really s for other people to answer that

But certainly I mean because I was ill this s uh earlier on this year I wasn't able to uh be at the edit really although uh Peter Cartwright who edited The Garden brought it in to the hospital a couple of times

Uh and ce certainly Sim Simon Turner who did the music and sound track which in that particular type of film is very very important did it after a few discussions cos I wasn't there at the sound dub

So when I saw the film it was a surprise I mean

And again with the camera work I mean although I did quite a bit of the actual landscape camera work perhaps all of it and some of the simpler super eight scenes there were several people doing things 

Di

Uh it 's famous that some film makers make the film  before they 've made the film like Hitchcock cos he it 's in his head

It 's it 's on the storyboard and then he 's rather bored when the cameras actually start rolling

Other people perhaps make the film in the editing room

Someone like Peckinpah probably makes it in the editing room

When does the film when is the film actually born for you

Yes

I have to say with that sort of film you 're you 're working on it all the time and you never know where it 's going to go uh until it 's finished

Now everyone says oh well then it 's an editor 's film

Well of course the editing is extremely important

But that isn't quite  uh the story because without a script the various scenarios in The Garden are an invention themselves and people come in and say  well uh uhm Ian who is uh one of the assistants on the film said oh I 've got a friend called Jessica Martin

She 's a singer

She would love to be in the film

And it and I and she was in the film within you know d a day or two

How much effect has winning the Booker Prize had on your life Antonia

It 's been a mixture of  extreme pleasure I 've had hundreds of letters from all sorts of people who have enjoyed the book  and considerable irritation because of being constantly interviewed

And the phone never stops going

And  people offer one goodies

Not that one doesn't get offered nice things

People ring up and say please come to Yugoslavia please come to Turkey please spend three weeks in Australia please come out to California

And all this is very very exciting

but I feel I 'm middle aged and want to write another book and another book and another book

and it 's rather horrid to have  nice things appearing to be like persecution

But has it had an effect on your work winning the prize i i in the sense that you now know you can write a best-selling prize-winning novel

I think it has yes

I think probably everybody who wins it  feels a bit inhibited because you think

can I do it again

or will they be annoyed with me if I now do something  of less general appeal

What about the desert island then

Does it hold any attraction for you at all

Oh yes

I I am a person addicted to solitude

I 'm a person who if I

I love talking but if I talk for three days flat without a longish period of solitude I begin to feel ill

So I think I could stand about sort of nine or ten months of the desert island without turning a hair as long as I could be fed and have something to drink

And what about the music uh uh uh

What does it mean to you music

Anything 

Some music means a very great deal

I always tell people I am not a musical person

I can't sing a note in tune and this is actually very important because it makes you feel humble and miserable about music

But there are certain pieces of music that have gripped me and moved me and twisted me about and those perhaps mean an awful lot more to me because I don't have a general musical culture very much

So what 's the first one you 'll play on the island

Oh

the first one  I think is very fitting because it 's part of Handel 's Messiah which is good for me because I come from Yorkshire from the background of the big choirs that really belt it out  this joyful music

And I wanted the He Shall Feed his Sheep because my father who also couldn't sing a note in tune but he had a beautiful voice used to sing it while the dishwasher was going which is how both of us used to sing because nobody could hear us because of the noise

Uh uh tell me Antonia Byatt about this family who recited Wordsworth over the Sunday lunch

I mean was that a typical scene

Not wholly typical

I mean there was a lot of grumbling and irritability but every now and then it all came together

I I What I really remember is once  uh just after the war when we 'd moved back to our house in Sheffield which we 'd left because of fear of the bombs

and my father had come out of the air force

and he was carving a huge great joint

and he suddenly recited the whole of Keats 's Ode to the Nightingale

and my mother kept putting the odd line in

And I think I remember it because we weren't always that happy and we didn't always have this sense of a family occasion

So you and your your uh brother and two sisters enjoyed all that did you

Oh yes I think uhm

I don't know what my mother would have done if we had not come out naturally bookish

But we did come out naturally bookish and

And is that something that you 've tried to continue with your own family

Do you Do you make literary allusions as you go about the o ordinary domestic business

uhm uhm

I do indeed and it annoys almost all of them

One of my daughters at a party opened the front door to the guests and said uhm uhm I am the youngest daughter of this house

I do not read books

There are too many books in this house

Excuse me I will take your coat

And then 

Uhm I think I 'm a bit too intense about books

So on going back to your to your childhood it was your mother wasn't it who was the the driving force behind all of this behind this sort of intellectual rigour

Both my parents really

They both went to Cambridge and my mother used to say I would have been top of the class if he hadn't been

But she personally was very bitter because she had to give up any kind of job hadn't she because she uh was a housewife and a mother and if that 's what you were that 's what you did and you did nothing else

Yes

Well I used to think that

And I used to think that she should have had more courage and that she should have actually gone on teaching or gone on doing something with her mind because I could see that not using her mind was torturing her 

And she told me very late in life what I should have known anyway which was that  the state prevented you from teaching the moment you got married in her day

She couldn't have gone on

I mean it was a flat clear clean choice between husband and children  and work

So she was she was trapped into staying at home and mangling the shirts

I think I think she would have stayed at home and mangled the shirts anyway because she felt that you know a respectable gentleman 's wife didn't  need to go out and work for a living

But she therefore took that out on you

Yes oh yes she did

She was very very angry  and all her daughters learnt the lesson  that  if you need to think you had better make provision for working and having a life of your own

You You 've talked in in various articles over the years about her making you feel utterly inadequate and and horrible

How did she do that

Uhm  really with noise

She had a sort of capacity for making a loud complaining noise

and anything that wasn't just as she had somehow envisioned it was going to be made her feel very nervous and hysterical

uhm 

And you knew when you came downstairs that she would have found something that you hadn't done  which she didn't even really want you to do

but she would start to shout about it

Uhm  that isn't all that she was

I mean she did  give us a great many books and and she did uhm  there was a sort of warmth in her as well

I 've talked about this because of course you can't talk about it when people are alive

Can you remember how you felt when you heard that she died 

That 's about eight or nine years ago wasn't it

Yes

I felt an immense space

I felt a huge amount of sort of brilliantly coloured air coming in through the window if I 'm going to be truthful 

And I also felt that she could stop hurting herself

I sort of felt that there was peace in a corner of my mind in which I always felt there was turmoil

And  after that I started thinking about her  as a young woman and I started mourning  not for my mother but for the girl who had gone to Cambridge and had been so brilliant 

And I began to be able to imagine her because she wasn't there shouting at me and grumbling about my father 's socks being in the wrong place and began to imagine what she was like when she used to read Keats to herself

And I do grieve a lot for that woman

I I miss I miss her you know

Shall we have your second record now

Uhm the second record is  Reginald Kell playing the Adagio from Mozart 's Clarinet Concerto

And I wanted this because as a little girl largely for health me measures to cure my asthma I was encouraged to play the clarinet and was taught by a teacher whose claim to fame was that he had taught Reginald Kell

and this Adagio is one of the pieces of music that twisted itself round my insides

I tears always come to my eyes when I hear these notes

I If you suffered at home Antonia was there salvation for you at school where you could shine

Uhm I didn't like school I think largely because I am a person who couldn't bear being at boarding school among other girls

I really do need to be alone for large patches

And I 'm not good at group life

But if they were asked to describe you those those peers of yours when you were aged fifteen or sixteen what would they have said

how would they have described you

They would have said she is little and small  and arrogant

Why arrogant

Probably I was in a way

I used to say what I thought 

I mean I used to say what I thought in class

I never spoke outside class

I never spoke to anybody

I was extremely lonely 

But in class I would sort of say what I thought

and after a bit I would see that everybody had just given up  saying anything themselves

and I would stop

Why didn't you speak to anybody outside class

Uhm I had no social graces

I had no  capacity to make friends I think

But didn't the teachers take any pride in you uh uh this this shining scholar

It was It was a very good Quaker moral school and the one thing you mustn't do is shine except at things that anybody could do

The The night before I did my A levels the headmistress made a very long speech saying that some girls thought that this was very important but that she would like to tell the school that she had written books and that she had made tablecloths and that in her view making tablecloths was a more satisfactory occupation and that these things didn't really matter and that the girls who couldn't do the exams shouldn't care

Uhm

and I see what she was trying to do

and it was a good and kind thing

but it meant that the one thing I could do  was not valued

Did you intend then even then to become a writer

Yes

Though I think if you 'd have asked me I wouldn't have said I did

I 've never really said this before

But from from being quite little  I started thinking how can I do it

what shall I do

And when I read Milton 's sonnet  about how fast time had stolen  his life from him and he reached three and twenty without achieving anything I thought and I mean I must then have been about thirteen

I thought

yes

that 's exactly how it is

that 's exactly how it is

time is just taking my life and I haven't done it

And what I wanted to do  was not  the same as oh achieve things in the world it

it was make something

It was make a work of art

It was do something like Keats 's Ode to a Nightingale

I wanted to make something like that

And And did you feel then when you w won a scholarship to Cambridge as you did that that was a move in the right direction that suddenly you were achieving some kind of freedom that was going to enable you to do these things

Yes and it was a freedom because everybody there  wanted to talk about  the life of the mind in one form or another and you didn't have to trouble with people who  thought that you ought not to do this

Everybody did want to

And so suddenly you were just in a world where it was all all right and you could be who you were

Rabbi Sacks the only previous occasion on which the Reith Lectures have been given by a man of religion was in the late nineteen seventies when Dr Edward Norman took as his theme Christianity and the World Order 

He argued that the values of the Church had come to be determined by the values of the age  and the lectures generated considerable public interest and were regarded by many members of the Anglican establishment as highly controversial which is to say that they didn't much like them

I seem to remember that the the first clerical letter of protest thumped onto the director general 's desk before Dr Norman had opened his mouth 

Now I musn't trespass on the subject matter of your lectures

but  tell me this

will they be about religion  and do you expect them to be controversial 

Well

they 'll certainly be about religion in contemporary society

and I suspect that they will be controversial

and perhaps I even hope that they will because I believe that religious thought must be challenging must force us to reflect on the values by which we live 

Now you 've been a scholar all your life and now suddenly you 're going to be catapulted into public life as as Chief Rabbi 

That 's not a prospect which all scholars would relish 

It isn't a prospect that I relish

but uh there 's a Jewish tradition  of uh scholarship in which after a certain stage you just have to get stuck in to public life 

and uhm that 's the tradition which reluctantly I have to follow

Is it going to make serious inroads into your writing 

Uh I should think so but uhm  in the end I think a religious thinker is judged  by what he does in life not just by the books that he writes

What does your wife think about the prospect of your becoming Chief Rabbi

I think we 're worried about the loss of privacy because we 're both very private people and uh I think that 's going to take a great deal of mental adjustment

I think we 'll manage it

When your appointment was as Chief Rabbi was announced one of your fellow rabbis who as they say preferred to remain anonymous was reported as saying he isn't Jewish enough 

Are you Jewish enough 

Well

I hope so

I mean

uh

I 've uh for the last ten or so years uh been involved in training rabbis

Of course I 've been a congregational rabbi

Uh what I think is happening to the Jewish community in this country and maybe  in other diaspora communities as well is that there 's a certain inward turn

A century ago one of the great  challenges to Jews was to combine  Jewish values and a secular education and somehow to make a creative synthesis out of the two

Nowadays we tend to see those things as perhaps incompatible and therefore you 're  Jewish only to the extent that you 're exclusively Jewish

Well I still feel that as Jews we 're challenged to participate in the wider society to share our values with our society and in turn to be inspired or provoked by the values that we find elsewhere

There was another comment made uh uh about the time of your appointment by Mr Stanley Kalms who I think until recently was chairman of Jews ' College 

and he said that you 'd have to walk a tightrope

What did he mean 

Right

I think probably what he meant is that the Jewish community in this country in common I should say with the United States community and maybe that in Israel  is becoming religiously quite polarised  between  a fairly secularised majority and a very very intensely religious minority and somehow the role of Chief Rabbi in Britain has been to  unify the community to represent it as a whole and that gets very difficult when it no longer thinks with one mind or speaks with one voice

I think that 's the tightrope 

Uhm

I notice that wrapped up in in all the press coverage about your appointment was a certain amount of comment on the  the position taken by your predecessor on a number of political and social issues

One commentator getting his his metaphors slightly mixed wrote about the the virtual canonization of Lord Jakobovits by the Prime Minister 

Now would would you anticipate that uhm in the fullness of time you would be similarly canonized

Does orthodoxy in fact incline to the right politically 

No I think that 's a uh misidentification 

Perhaps a half century ago the identification would have been made in completely the opposite direction 

Then it was naturally assumed that Judaism was identical with socialism 

and uhm had anyone challenged this Jews would have been surprised 

and therefore  those changes really represent sociological shifts in the Jewish community

but ideologically you couldn't possibly identify the biblical or the prophetic or the rabbinic tradition with a party political programme

If you were to ask me which party would Moses or Abraham have voted for in a general election I 'd have to say

I really don't know 

You didn't always mean to be a rabbi did you

No 

I uh started life wanting to be  an accountant really

I think that was in those days every Jewish boy 's dream uh f for reasons which elude me 

but then of course I went into secular philosophy

and uh  I don't know

I suppose I experienced a very minor kind of conversion at the time of the Six Day War in nineteen sixty-seven when I think

When you would be how old

I was a first year undergraduate at Cambridge then

The weeks leading up to that event really did radicalise Jewish consciousness throughout the world and as a student I felt it particularly acutely 

Now education is  traditionally of profound importance for the Jewish community

You were principal of Jews ' College for six years

What did you set out to do

and what did you achieve 

Jews ' College is an institution which trains rabbis and teachers

so I think the first thing that I  really wanted to do is to encourage as far as possible our best minds to go into teaching or the rabbinate

and of course the word rabbi really means teacher

so that too is an educational function 

Judaism is a religion which values  serving God with the mind as well as with the heart 

and that 's something that  was a very proud and rich heritage for eighteen hundred years since  from the first century to the nineteenth century but which just seemed to disintegrate somehow when Jews entered the open society

Jewish education  more or less collapsed 

and I think if Judaism is to be revived it has to be made intellectually stimulating and challenging

and of course it has tremendous resources to do so

So the first thing I wanted to do was  to have rabbis and teachers who could really challenge and stimulate

and the second thing I w wanted to do was to spread a sense of that challenge and excitement to the wider Jewish community which we 've done through various publications and conferences that we 've organised 

Can I take you back to a a point you touched on briefly a little a little earlier

In your Uh in your book Traditional Alternatives  you say that since the early nineteen eighties a series of tensions have been evident throughout the Jewish world and the first one you identify is a growing rift between orthodoxy and reform particularly in the United States 

What are the reasons for that 

Orthodoxy I would say is  a stance of resistance  to the modern world  basically because many of the values in our secular culture are profoundly disruptive of tradition and of Jewish life 

Reform parts company with orthodoxy on this and would be categorised as a movement of accommodation

This is where Jews are if they aren't particularly inclined to be religious

and therefore to some extent we have to go with the values of the age if we 're to retain their affiliation

And the more secular our culture becomes the wider becomes the drift between those two approaches

Orthodoxy has never seen reform as theologically valid but there  can over time be a widening gap between the positions taken by the two groups for instance on  sexual ethics on homosexuality on the role of women on the ordination of women as rabbis

These become key issues in which the two groups become further and further divided 

I 'd be right in saying I think that there 's been a very considerable  resurgence of orthodoxy in in recent years and yet at the same time it appears to be the case that Jewry is in some ways becoming increasingly secularised 

Now what are the  what are the conflicting currents that are operating there 

Well

the issue is just how do you live as a Jew  in a culture which undermines virtually every Jewish value

Judaism can't survive for instance without strong families  and the family is rapidly eroding

Among Jews as well our rates of mixed marriage are high of non-marriage of divorce of single-parent families  and that really threatens the whole of Jewish continuity

The same question will arise on many other values where for instance Judaism depended on a kind of kinship between parents and children handing the tradition on across the dinner table  and within the synagogue

Now as parents and children get more and more divided how do those traditions go on

So a group of Jews say 

the only way we can protect Judaism is to withdraw 

and another group of Jews say

the only way we can sustain Jewish identity is to redefine its terms 

So that is why you get an increasingly secular majority who are redefining the terms of what it means to be a Jew  and a very passionate orthodox minority  who are essentially becoming strong because they can stand aside from where the culture is 

I was struck in in one of your books by uhm a a question you pose

you called it a a tantalisingly simple question 

Uh which you ask is the more authentic the more mandated by tradition religious moderation  or religious extremism 

What is your answer to that question

My answer is  that religious moderation has had a terrible press  in the last couple of decades

You can't be moderate and authentic

Now I really do disagree with that for one simple reason

Judaism is built on the idea of a covenant  that unites an entire group of people into a religious community  and for that reason historically Judaism has been very opposed to elites 

The elites don't define Judaism

They th There can be a spiritual a mystical a pietist elite

and we will admire them

but they don't define the terms of Judaism

Those are defined in very broad terms to include the entire Jewish people 

Now that demanded moderation

I once called it moderation as high religious art 

and I believe that we need to hear that voice again moderation not just as compromise as wishy-washy liberalism or what have you but as absolutely fundamental religious principle

We are bound together by religion

That is what unites us

it is not what divides us 

Question about style of argument and debate

I was much struck by a a phrase in in one of your books where you say

to lose the argument  is as enlightening as to win it



Now I uhm stand lost in admiration before a formulation like that

but it seems to me that uh to be able to  indulge in debate on those terms  calls either for uh a saintliness of character which few possess  or for quite remarkable reserves of self-confidence or possibly for both 

What 's the origin of this distinction you 're making between arguing for truth and arguing for victory 

The rabbis coined the phrase argument for the sake of heaven  and I think by this they meant  that religious truth  is never simple and linear

There are at least two perspectives

At the most reductive  there 's the perspective of man and the perspective of God 

There is not a single dimension to truth

Different voices must be heard 

and that concept of argument where those voices are brought into dialogue and therefore the whole picture emerges because you hear those different voices is fundamental to religious consciousness

even more so to biblical consciousness

It 's in the Bible that Abraham stands up and argues with God over the fate of the cities of the plain

Moses argues with God

Jeremiah does so

Job does so

That powerful argument in which man and God stand each with their own dignity their own integrity bound together by a mutual covenant but each representing a different point of view

The Talmud the classic text of Jewish literature is simply an anthology of arguments 

and I was very impressed by a formulation given by a  a non-Jewish philosopher by Alistair McIntyre who once defined tradition  as an ongoing argument about the key values that constitute a culture 

Now when you see tradition that way  as a totality as a conversation then we 're in far less danger than we are otherwise of reducing it to a simple set of  exclusive doctrines which as it were may well be true but only partially true

But you started writing poetry didn't you 

Oh I 've written poetry all my life yes 

I think that 's something you do mo more when you 're young perhaps than than later on but I 've  I wrote a a great deal of it when I was young 

What was it that inspired you to write poetry

Was th you l lot of them are are subjects from nature aren't they

lots of birds and countryside and

I honestly don't know uhm 

People always ask me this about my novels too

What made you write them

What inspired you to do it

And it 's a question that simply can't be answered 

If the the spring of the writing is there in you something will start it flowing just something you see something you hear something you read 

and then as you 're writing the inspiration comes

As for poetry it 's awfully difficult to talk about you know

It 's been so much a part of my life ever since I was a child 

I thought in terms of poetry

I think 

and I wrote  everything I wanted to record went into that form i if if that makes sense 

You always read poetry presumably

Yes always

I lectured in English at Durham University and uh 

Well I studied English all my life so of course  I love poetry

Poetry 's lovely to read in bed at night

I think it uhm  it quietens your mind and  flattens your spirit out

Who are your favourite poets 

Well  different ones for different times I think 

Thinking of ones who have perhaps influenced me certainly Walter De La Mare 

Gerard Manley Hopkins  I love 

John Donne  Matthew Arnold 

Is he a rather neglected poet

You don't hear people enthusing very much about Arnold but I think he 's wonderful 

And of course the greats like Tennyson and so on

Mm

And yet you still hear people say that they 've they can read novels and they can read biographies but they 've never got as far as poetry because they don't understand it or there 's a barrier there for them somewhere

What do you think that kind of barrier is 

Haven't they got that the wrong way round

I would have thought that as a child you started with poetry

I mean a child has this natural sense of rhythm and they love verses they love poetry and it 's easy to learn when you 're a child

You can understand such a lot of poetry at a child 's level which later on becomes much more complicated

You realise there 's more to it

But I would have thought you started with poetry 

Y you say in one introduction that poetry came easily to you in your youth

Do you know why that was

When I said it came easily I I meant what I said just now that I thought in those terms and and if I wanted to say something or  or describe something it went into s it went into poetic form 

But it 's never easy

I 've never found writing easy

Does novel-writing not come easily to you

No no it 's very difficult indeed 

I I make uhm  up to four drafts of of every book and it takes me ages and ages

Some bits do come easily  and some bits some pages you can write and you never have to go back over but on the whole it has to be written and rewritten and cut and shr shifted and rewritten 

And when you go back perhaps twenty years later to to read something which you wrote then you cannot remember writing it

you can't even remember how you thought of putting it like that

It seems to be so naturally on the page

But it wasn't easy at the time

So what 's your day like

I mean do you have to discipline yourself if you find writing hard

Do you have to  give yourself

Yes well we 're we 're actually talking a bit in the past now

I 'm taking life I 'm sort of retired 

But when I was in full flow as it were of writing uhm I had to discipline myself very severely so many hours a day

I used to set so much a day either so many hours or so many words whichever came first 

And sometimes you had to force yourself for every minute of it to go on writing and go on working 

And on other days it was coming

and you didn't want to stop

and you went on longer than you need

That was wonderful 

I 've never known a novelist who said that writing was easy  and I 've known very few who 've said it was enjoyable

But was it an enjoyable process

Did you feel satisfied when you 'd finished 

Well there 's a difference between enjoying the thing and being satisfied with it

I never enjoy it

It was never enjoyable

It was always terribly hard work

And you 've got to be self-critical and that 's extremely difficult

You can't really be the only judge of your own work because you 're too close to it

You  can be satisfied afterwards

and that is the that 's the only reward there is really the the satisfaction of work well done if it is well done 

Is that the reason for carrying on doing it

It was does seem a very odd occupation  carry on flogging yourself th through

It 's an extremely odd occupation

It 's it 's uhm and probably every writer would say the same thing but it 's an inner compulsion

If you 're born a writer you 're a writer

and that 's all there is to it

It 's like being born a fish

You can't come out of water 

But you you laid aside poetry at one point and wrote a novel

Do you know what led you to write a novel 

It wasn't a question of laying aside poetry

It was  the the compulsion to write stories was always there too

I used to write those oh from childhood 

Uhm what lead me to write the first one 

I think it was wanting to re-create a a lovely hot place like Provence in the middle of an English winter 

And I found myself led into the story and realised that  well perhaps I 'd finish one this time and make a story of it

I still remember how I first started to write 

Uhm my husband is a very keen fisherman and his friend used to call and they used to talk about fish 

So one cold January evening in Durham  I decided that I wasn't going to listen to them talking about fish any more

I went into the other room with a pencil and a piece of paper and I started to write a book 

It was eventually published as Madam Will You Talk 

And this is how it began 

And that was the beginning of a far from normal holiday for for Charity 

After that of course I had to write another 

In fact I  I was in gear and  stayed in gear

Was that first one a great success 

Yes it it it was a bestseller which was uh rather marvellous 

And it was a novel of suspense

Yes that was a novel of suspense 

What attracted you to that form 

I honestly don't know 

It 's not the the actual story or even the people  that attract me to write about something

It 's the places 

All my books all the suspense novels the early ones are set in different places in different countries

And uhm it was a desire to re-create the places  and  perhaps explore the history of the place

I don't know

That sounds a bit stuffy because they are  good rattling adventure stories at the top level

It 's the place that always leads me into it

Do you do a lot of travelling to find material  or did it come the other way round

No it 's the other way round

Uhm I used to go for you know fortnights abroad holiday or something

And if the place I 'd go to a place because of its associations usually historical or literary

If the place grabbed me then I re-created it and put a story there

That 's really how it worked

Uhm

I mean

the bulk of your your writing was done at a time when I suppose the the whodunnit the sort of Agatha Christie novel was at its most popular

but you 've never touched that form have you

No because I never liked it

I never liked reading it I mean

Uhm  I suppose it 's a sort of guessing game 

My second book Wild Fire At Midnight 

I used  some of the conventions of the of the whodunnit

For instance there 's there 's usually in in Agatha Christie  who was a wonderful writer and a very nice lady  someone goes into  a library and finds a body there and says

oh dear

there 's a corpse in the library

Don't let 's tell the police

I mean 

now if you went into your library and found a corpse there you would A scream B probably be sick  C rush for the telephone and get the police as quickly as you possibly could

And  there 's another convention of the whodunnit in which the heroine is told now I 'm going to leave you alone in the locked house

Don't let anybody in except me

And then the first knock that comes at the door the silly fool goes and opens it

You know this happens over and over again

Well

those two particular conventions of whodunnit  I wrote in Wild Fire At Midnight

I exploded them

I it was just a bit of fun

Mm 

You you mentioned for instance in in The Ivy Tree you mentioned Josephine Tey

and I wondered if she 'd been any kind of influence on you one of the books that you 've enjoyed reading 

Oh Bratt Farrar you mean

I mentioned that yes

Yes I think Josephine Tey was a wonderful mixture of  knowledge l learning and also  r romanticism 

I remember  long long ago telling my publishers that that 's who I would like to be like uh Josephine Tey who was not only romantic in the proper use of the word  but also intelligent and wrote well 

Mm

There seems to be a a a very strong  moral sense behind your writing

Yes

there is

I mean

not in a didactic way

but it seems to be part of your cast of mind

I once said I I remember  and I think it sums it up that I would never want anyone to be  any the worse for having read anything I 've written

But do you think people are a a are a lot better for reading what you 've written

Oh I wouldn't say that

I I simply don't know 

But I wouldn't want to put a smear on anyone 's mind 

Yes

there 's a lot of thrill in your books

but there 's no violence is there 

Mm

No no unpleasant violence

There has to be a certain amount of  of excitement I suppose

But it 's understated violence isn't it

It 's understated

S I I detest violence violent books 

Your heroines are very much of a type aren't they

They 're very strong-willed 

Uhm they 're usually attractive and feminine

I think 

not strong-willed

but possibly with a very strong sense of right and wrong that they 've jolly well got to stick to

I think it 's the way one 's brought up

That was how I was brought up and I 'm stuck with it 

Yes they 're always thrown in at the deep end aren't they

And they 're kind of well-meaning amateurs who win through in the end 

They 're always people who find themselves in difficult situations

Yes

Yes yes

Because I think of the way uh as we were saying earlier because I start with the place 

And if you choose your place like Delphi or Crete or wherever else I 've set my books you you send someone into them an amateur as you say

uh

the situation arises from the place that they 're in

After writing what ten novels of suspense and then one novel as a kind of a bridge passage you 've moved into historical fiction indeed right back to the fifth century

What was it that attracted you to Merlin 

I 'd always been interested in ancient history and I 'd always wanted to write a historical novel 

I 'd been moving gradually towards that in my mind anyway

It was ancient history that attracted me

but when it came to the point I wanted to set the book in my own country and so  Roman Britain seemed to be the right setting for it

And then I came across  the idea of writing about Merlin 

And there was quite a challenge in this because a lot of Arthurian stories of course are set in medieval times with knights in armour and so on

and I wanted to put it back into its rightful century when Arthur when King Arthur really lived 

So I started to think about the Crystal Cave

Sheila Mottley you 've spent the past twenty-eight years caring for your children and in particular your eldest daughter Jeanette who was born with no arms or legs 

Yes

That is correct 

Uhm Jeanette  unfortunately as I found out later was the result of thalidomide but there again she 's not on her own

There 's about four hundred and twenty of these children 

But from what I can gather Jeanette is one of the worst  b because like you 've just said she 's got no arms  and she 's got h hardly any lower limbs whatsoever 

But saying that it 's not stopped Jeanette getting on in life

How soon was it that you knew there was something wrong with your baby 

Well actually uhm I was told when I was when I was pregnant  much to my alarm uhm that I was carrying a child with no upper limbs  and they didn't know to what extent the lower limbs had been damaged  but not to sort of look forward to a great deal because they didn't think she 'd live 

And uhm they said well I 'd just have to proceed with the pregnancy and uh get it over and done with and go and start again  on the next one like a baby machine 

But it didn't turn out like that

No 

Twenty-eight years later she is still with us the person that everybody had said would not walk not talk

It 's just not worked like that at all 

It was a difficult birth

Did they hand Jeanette to you immediately she was born

Uhm no I didn't look at Jeanette to be totally honest with you until Jeanette was three days old 

And the reason for that before you ask me was that uhm everybody was confusing my brain 

People were telling me to do one thing

Some like the doctor said there was these institutions where I could send her and it was the best thing for her and it would be the best thing for Terry and the best thing for me

Terry your husband

Terry being my husband 

Of course he was all for that and so was his family 

My father and mum were  whatever I decided to do 

I mean I must admit the first day I said yes yes yes

I agreed to anything 

I just wanted people to stop badgering me 

On the second day and I still hadn't seen her

I mean all the girls on the ward had seen her but me 

And they sort of were making very polite conversations with me about everything apart from babies 

And I decided I think I decided really that I wasn't going to part with her then

But I think really what made my mind up was when my husband Terry gave me a ultimatum  cos I I 've always been the sort of person you can ask me to do something for you and I 'll do it

but don't tell me what to do because I 'll do the complete opposite

And he informed me that if I brought Jeanette home he was going 

So  I wouldn't sign these forms that people kept pushing underneath my nose for her to be released 

And then I decided that I wanted to see her which was the third day lunch time everybody having their dinner 

Can't you wait Mrs Mottley

Well I was Mrs Henry then

Can't you wait until everybody 's finished having their lunch

I said no I can't

I want to see my daughter now

And when you bring her please bring her with no clothes on 

Not that I was being brave

Don't think that for one minute 

But I thought well if I 've got to look at this child that everybody 's telling me is so grotesque  I 'd rather see it all at once  than do it in bits and pieces 

So of course they brought her in 

And after about three or four minutes of looking at the top half of her I pulled the covers back

and as I pulled the covers back she opened her eyes

She looks up at me and she was squinting 

And I looked at her eyes

and then I looked down on her body

and all I thought was

poor little bugger

you 've got your arms and legs missing

and you 've got a squint as well 

And I picked her up and she n nestled her little head like she used to do when she was inside of me into my neck

And that was it

I was not signing any paper

She wasn't going anywhere 

She was coming home with me 

And that 's what I did

And he went

Your husband went

Yes

So at the age of twenty

Yes

I was tw only twenty

Whose home did you take her to

I went back to my father 's 

But the hospital had told me that the child wouldn't live

So I 'd not prepared myself 

I 'd not got anything at all

Fortunately I 'd got a very good neighbour and she 'd got a daughter who were very very good

And everything was there waiting for me baby clothes and everything

And my dad had gone out and he 'd bought vests and nappies and he 'd washed them all and aired them all 

So everything was done when I got home 

And that was the end of your marriage except for a brief period of reconciliation

Which I 'd prefer not to talk about

but I suppose I must 

In a moment of weakness I believed that he was going to come back 

He wanted to try

So we went back together for a week

But after two days it was obvious that it wouldn't work because he didn't want me to even pick the child up

When he came in from work I had to devote all my time to him and leave Jeanette alone 

But unfortunately in that week I got pregnant again  with my second child 

So now you 're left living in your parents ' home with two children  one perfectly normal

I mean Neil your son was born

That 's true

Oh yes

Yes

Perfectly all right

And the same lady that done the x-rays with Jeanette did them with Neil

and she told me the second time I was going to have a little boy

and the same way she told me the first time it was a little girl

It amazed me that because there wasn't much of Jeanette

so how on earth she could tell me it was a girl

all I can say is she was she was good at her job 

What kind of child was Jeanette

Very very demanding 

From the time I brought her out of hospital she never slept 

You 've got twenty-four hours in a day 

Jeanette took up twenty-two of them 

You know she 's a bit like that now 

But uhm  she was always wanting to do things

Like I used to put her on the floor and she could roll  or I 'd put her on a potty and she 'd get her all over the house

In fact she 'd get somewhere quicker than me 

They gave me some cosmetic arms for Jeanette

So s if I was taking her out I could put them on and put a coat over them to make them look great

Right

Now  I 'll never forget

One day I put these arms on her and I put a coat on her

I mean

it was a bit stupid really because I mean at the other end of the coat there was no legs was there

Right

Anyway we 've got these arms

And they were like dolls ' arms

And I was getting on a bus 

And one of the arms got stuck

And there was a lady that went to get hold of Jeanette 's hand  right  to help me not realising they were plastic

And when the lady touched them she was that shocked she fell back in the bus 

That 's terrible

So we didn't use them any more 

We put them away

She was the way she was

and that was it 

No

Well Jeanette went to a a hospital for a a while didn't she to have artificial limbs fitted

and by this stage you 'd fallen in love with a singer from a a West Indian band

That 's right I had

I it was like one of these  Mills and Boon 's books I suppose

It was across a crowded room

I mean  he was from Barbados and he was very dark skinned and all I could see was the eyes because the place was very dark 

And I was dancing with somebody else

and over this  person 's shoulder I could see these eyes sort of glaring at me

And as soon as the band finished and they had a break he was over to the table immediately 

And that was it

I was totally infatuated by him 

So you set up house together

Yes 

After uh it causing a great deal of trouble because  in those days it just was not done  for a white woman to go with a coloured man 

It wasn't heard of

and especially in the area where I lived

I mean

well  you were nothing but a tart if you did that  which is something unfortunately he uh seemed to arrange easily for me not so long after I 'd met him 

What

that you should be a tart

Well

I 'd like to think of myself more of a 

Well I was a high-class prostitute 

So how do you mean he arranged that for you

Well he introduced me to that life style 

What

He just said go out and be a prostitute

No

No it wasn't quite that easy actually

It well it was sort of when we had got no food 

And uh there was just sort of enough for Neil 

He was marvellous with Neil

Can't take that away from him

And it was a case of well one of us has got to go out and get some money 

and seeing as how you 're the better looking out of the two of us I think it should be you 

But I hadn't got a clue

I really hadn't got a clue

So  he directed me where to go

He took me

He dropped me off on this road where all the girls worked which is well-known road in Manchester which I don't think I should mention cos they 're trying to clear it up at the moment 

And uhm  he left me there with this packet of Durex  which I hadn't got a clue what to do with to be totally honest 

And the first car that drew up at the side of me I just froze  on the spot

I knew I I had an idea what I had to say because he 'd primed me in all that

Right 

And I opened my mouth and nothing would come out 

But I heard this door open and I heard a voice saying Sheila

I thought my god somebody knows me

And when I turned round it happened to be one of his very good friends  who proceeded to give me a telling off for being there in the first place and took me back home

And what did Kelly say to see you come back

He was not amused 

He just gave his friend enough time to get out of the area and told me to get out there and not to bother coming back  until I came back with some money 

Sheila I mean you 're tough enough to have said no to him if you 'd really wanted to

Yes

I could 've said no 

I realise now I could 've said no 

But all that time ago no I couldn't have

And there was a reason

He showed me a great deal of love 

He showed my children love something that their own father hadn't shown them 

I mean he was  a all prepared to help support me and look after Jeanette if I wanted him to  as I thought 

But saying that he was marvellous with Neil 

And uh as you say I could 've said no 

But I must tell you I was very very frightened of him 

He controlled me  sexually

And he also controlled me with fear 

What

You mean he was violent 

I knew he could be 

I 'd stood up to him on two occasions and I realised you just didn't stand up to him 

He was I mean I 'm not even five foot and he was six foot four 

Not that that 's any excuse 

Uh and I think we 're forgetting the biggest factor

I did love him 

And I was a very very stupid twenty-two-year-old girl 

Did you remain an unwilling prostitute 

For a while yes

Mark Brickman can we talk first about Sheffield itself

As I 've said many people of your generation fight shy in the current climate of running these big regional playhouses

Did you have any doubts about taking over the Crucible or not

None at all

It was the theatre that I 'd wanted to work in for some time because I 've got a great interest in epic theatre and big plays which which require a certain kind of stage

And so that was one of the reasons that I 'd always felt keen to come to Sheffield

The other was it was quite clear from having travelled through the area over the last few years  with a a number of my productions with A T C that there was an enormous amount of civic regeneration happening in Sheffield and that it was a very exciting time to to be in this area 

Well you say you like epic plays which obviously your track record shows

but what do you think the job of a theatre like the Crucible is going to be in the nineteen nineties

Is it there to serve everyone 

I think the job of the Crucible has changed actually as a result of the Lyceum opening next door

We are programming the two theatres together and the idea is that the Lyceum is a home for touring productions whereas the Crucible obviously is the producing company of Sheffield

I think the influx of high quality touring material into the Lyceum is actually going to free up the Crucible to hopefully pursue a a a considerably innovative programme over the next decade or so

Well that 's interesting

I 'd like to talk to you about choice of plays because I remember asking your predecessor in Sheffield Clare Venables if every director had a platonic list of plays they would love to do but can't because of cost etc

And she said yes of course but you try and smuggle in some of your ideal plays every season

Is that how you see it

Oh absolutely

I mean I would hope I could I could smuggle in qu quite a few of them though

I think there are certain things which I would like to see on that stage which which haven't been done recently

It would be great to see some Jacobean work

It would it would be marvellous to see a Greek tragedy there

And one of the reasons for choosing a play for example like A View From The Bridge  was precisely because of of the way it traverses a a contemporary setting and also something which is considerably more epic and passionate in it in its scope

I mean your opening season is a fairly eclectic mix isn't it

There 's Sh Shakespeare as we 've said Arthur Miller uh The Innocents then a Canadian play by Michel Tombrey and Billy Budd

A transatlantic bias obviously

Why is that 

It 's very odd

but for some reason uhm I have a strong sense that American drama and North American drama has a real uh connection with with people in Sheffield

I mean that 's both from looking at at the track record of of of what has worked here but also it 's it 's a a very strong sense that I get from from being in this particular community at the moment

Having said that I mean the reason for choosing all four plays was was really because I wanted to put  stories of humanity passion and theatricality back to the fore and I wanted to to see whether we could introduce a kind of repertoire which would get an audience leaning forward in their seats and extremely involved with watching what was happening on on the Crucible stage

Is that because American plays have this  strong emotional core to them do you think

I think that 's absolutely right

And I think that 's that 's what I 've always found very attractive in in the Sheffield audience

I suppose one of the things that is very different for me now from having run A T C is that with A T C I was on the move the whole time and I never had a chance to meet my audience if you like from us going to each venue perhaps twice a year and

and so you didn't have the chance to to to have a kind of sustained contact with people

From having that now I I find that very liberating and

and the thing that I sense in the audience here is that they want stories of humanity where you see people on stage in all their with all their flaws and contradictions

and that is precisely the kind of theatre that I 'm interested in 

Is there a danger do you think in Sheffield as there is in other theatres that the studio becomes the main repository for new work

I mean this season you 've got I see new plays in the studio by Christina Reed Paul Abbot a visiting company doing Harold Barker

I can actually remember a new Harold Barker on the main stage at the Crucible

Do you think there is a danger the studio theatre siphons off the new work

Absolutely

And that 's something which I 'm I 'm very keen to address

I 'm just looking at the moment at at our kind of commissioning policy for the next eighteen months

And one of the things that I feel very strongly about is that we must commission new writers to write for the main stage 

When I was at A T C I worked with the the Travis playwright John Clifford on a seventeenth century Spanish drama which we adapted and and John essentially made into a new play

And one of the things that became quite clear from that was that new playwrights need to work with large spaces with large epic material

And uh I think it 's up to theatres like the Crucible to actually give them that opportunity 

Yes

because I would have thought the tragedy of British theatre actually over the last decade has been that new writing has become a ghetto-ised and studio-bound affair on the whole hasn't it

Absolutely

And this was one of the reasons for for for trying to take a a piece like Trombolo 's The Good Sisters which is a a remarkable celebratory piece about fifteen women on stage together

Trombolo describes it as a cantata for fifteen female voices

And to to actually see whether whether we could fill the uh the main stage with that

That 's obviously the problem

It 's finding writers who write with a scale but also with a sense of uh what is attractive to an audience

And uh from having come from A T C where I was working on classical texts by people like Moli&egrave;re and Shakespeare one of the other things I feel strongly about is that we 've got to get writers back into the theatre more involved with actors and what is happening in the rehearsal room

so that as with Moli&egrave;re and Shakespeare these writers see and test daily what is working how you can write material which is both philosophically and emotionally interesting and exploring issues that you that you want to look at but also is definitely hooking into an audience in the way that obviously a play like Miller 's View From The Bridge is 

What worries me about regional theatres at the moment is that almost none of them have permanent companies

Is that simply a question of money and cost 

I don't really see why it should be because of course if you 're if you 're through casting and having a having a company which is performing in the evening and and rehearsing in the daytime you actually save considerably

So as as far as I can see it at the moment from my end economics don't seem to really come into it

You actually save money by by by working with a pool of actors 

No

I think it 's something to do with the fact that that kind of ideal and model of ensemble theatre which was so strong in the sixties somehow went out of fashion and the w the whole pressure on actors to to stay in large cities in London the pressure put upon them by agents sometimes to uh you know not to go out and work in the provinces

I think it 's become more and more difficult

But certainly it 's it 's my sort of  my greatest goal I suppose for the for the work at the Crucible that uhm starting from the autumn I would hope that we could have a certainly a pool of actors who would go through a number of productions and that ideally I would like at some stage for that to become very much as as permanent a company as possible

You say it

it 's not only a question of money

but isn't that at the root of it because it 's surely quite difficult these days to persuade an actor or actress to commit themselves for what six to eight months when there is always the the possibility isn't there of lucrative television work

I suppose that 's r yes I suppose that 's right as well

I think what you 've got to do is you 've got to try and set up again for people a kind of of of a vision of theatre and uh a vision of creating theatre

The way that you rehearse the way that you you construct a certain atmosphere of like-minded people in a rehearsal room whereby they will want to come and and commit themselves to it and they will be prepared if you like to lose out on some of the financial rewards of yuh of doing the lucrative T V stuff 

Yes

because when you ran A T C Actors ' Touring Company obviously actors were stomping the country weren't they doing a single play for quite a period of time

And I presume they probably gained more from that than they do from just doing a one-off engagement in a regional playhouse

They develop more surely

I think so

I mean I think one of the dangers of of repertory theatre as it exists at the moment is that it 's very easy to feel that you 're getting caught on a kind of assembly line of productions both as the director and also as an actor that either you 're simply doing a one-off piece and and that then the collective energy of the group who have put it together just disappears just evaporates or that you 're simply if you like uh churning out kind of one play after another with different groups of people

And I think the kind of ensemble that was operating say at the the R S C in the early days in the sixties where you had a much smaller company allowed people to feel that they were actually learning something and training together

You were able to quantify your own progress and also to quantify how you as a company were succeeding with your audience 

Does it strike you at all that we 're building up rather separate audiences in Britain

Uh

for example the kind of audience that goes to small-scale or medium-scale touring works such as you were doing such as Cheek By Jowl do in other words the audience that goes to rather bold classical pieces of theatre on the one hand

But then there 's another audience is there that goes to regional playhouses a rather more stolid audience

Is that true 

I think it probably has been true over the last fifteen years or so

And I think one of the excitements of the next ten years is going to be to see whether the regional theatres can take on board the discoveries that have been made by by the small-scale touring companies

And I think in that sense I am very grateful for the the the fact that uh that I someone of my kind of age has been given the chance to run the Crucible

And I when I see similar appointments being made around the country I think it augurs well because what we 've got to do is we 've got to get those  if you like slightly more conservative stolid audiences that have been there in the regional theatres actually opening up to a kind of vision of theatre which uhm you know which has previously just been as you say the prerogative of of companies like Shared Experience and Cheek by Jowl and A T C 

Can we talk about your own specific productions at the Crucible

You 've you 've opened your innings with The Taming Of The Shrew

Now there 's a difficult play isn't it because how does

how does one find a line into that play which seems on the surface to be a testament to male supremacy 

Unless you believe in male supremacy

Well that 's certainly one part of the play

There 's also another part of the play of course which is very strongly rooted in a tradition of commedia del arte uh a tradition which is which is satirising human vice and looking at society and actually saying you know what is what is corrupt in this society and uhm and uhm that was something which I wanted to apply to the play to see whether we could we could therefore do it in i in modern terms

Thank you 

Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker 

And Mr Deputy Speaker I would like to start by congratulating my honourable friend on  drawing the number he did in the ballot

And I congratulate him also on the way in which he introduced this measure 

But I do have to say that I have very serious reservations about his bill 

And I would like to start Mr Deputy Speaker  by going back in time and looking at how a particular area of human settlement is dealt with over the centuries

If we take a site like Southwark on the south bank of the Thames if you go back at least two thousand years you will find evidence of settlement there 

And then when the Romans came they used the same area for further building

and then throughout the Dark Ages and at the time of the Norman conquest and through medieval times

Point of order Mr Speaker

Could you just clarify it for me

We have had a vote on the closure and if members of this House wanted the debate not to be continued further it was clear that they voted for the closure 

The other option was for them to vote for the debate to be continued

Is it in order for a member who did not vote for the debate to be continued then to stand up to continue the debate after that vote is taken

Yes

What is happening is is perfectly in order

The perhaps it would be helpful if I remind the House

In order for a closure to be carried  there have to be a hundred honourable members voting for the closure

There were not a hundred members voting for the closure

So that meant that the the closure was decided in the negative

And it follows automatically from that that the House has decided it 's not the Chair that the House has decided that the debate should continue

So what is happening is in order

Mr Summerson

Point of order

Point of order Mr Skinner

Mr Deputy Speaker you will know that in these troubled times of people not declaring their interest and the fact that members  are going to debate a very important issue next week  on somebody failing to register interest of the order of about eighty thousand pound 

Would you think it advisable that in a debate  which would 've taken place to deal with the question of those seeking compensation from the state  that 'd uh was who 'd died from cancer and widows would benefit and those that are dying from cancer would you consider that if a member of Lloyds or involved in the insurance market who might well not be very keen on the state paying out handouts  ought to declare their interest before they make speeches of

Will you examine the record to see whether the member for Wanstead and Woodford and anybody else who has taken part in this debate have or have not declared their interest because there 's no doubt at all that if the state pays compensation that 's less of a market for those that are in Lloyds

and I think it needs examining

Order

Point of order Mr Deputy Speaker

Mr Rogers further to the point of order

When the honourable member arose in his seat to to open his contribution to this debate I didn't hear him uhm Mr Deputy Speaker and I don't think that you did uh either because I don't think that he made one any declaration of his interests

Now as I understand it under the rules of order of this House members are asked to make a declaration of their interest in the Register of Members ' Interest and then to declare it in the debate when they 're speaking

There 's already one member of the party opposite who has been investigated as a result of being in breach of this standing order

The honourable gentleman opposite is now speaking on a debate which is is to do with property  is to do with the value of property is to do with planning permission 

The honourable gentleman for Walthamstow  is a director of a property company  and a chartered surveyor 

I I submit Mr Deputy Speaker

I submit Mr Deputy Speaker he is in breach of the rules of the House 

He is in breach of the rules of the House and you should bring him to order



O o order

The House knows very well that honourable members who have an interest to declare in the debate which is proceeding should declare that interest

And I am sure that is well known in the House

and I am sure every honourable member will observe it

If if any honourable gentleman feels that there has been a breach of that strong convention well then the correct procedure is to write uh on that matter to the chairman of the Select Committee on Members ' Interests

Mr Summerson

Mr Holt point of order

Mr Deputy Speaker that if the Labour Party  had had enough of their members had bothered to come here today we wouldn't have had we wouldn't have had all these points of order because they would have been able to carry the closure motion

Mist Mr Summerson

Mr Summerson

Mr Deputy Speaker 

Mr Deputy Speaker

In view  in view of the

Point of order

Mr Deputy Speaker 

Mr Deputy Speaker  I am going to speak very honestly

What 's making me sick this afternoon is the honourable gentleman for Wanstead and Woodford who was born in nineteen fifty-two

And that honourable gentleman was born in nineteen fifty

The people in a place we can't mention  fought and many died so that people like those could come into this Chamber in a free democracy

And now and now they have taken advantage of the situation to speak out the bill of the honourable member for St Albans

O order

Order

order

Order

Order

Or

Order

Order

Order

Order

Order

The honourable gentleman is speaking from a front bench and the Chair does expect him to set a good example

The point that he the point he 's raised is a perfectly legitimate point of debate but it is not a point of order to the Chair

Mr Summerson

Mr Deputy Speaker I think that I must defend myself against what has been said about my declaring my interest 

And I see from the third paragraph of my notes here that I have put in brackets state C S

I was coming on to the fact

I was  

Mr Deputy Speaker  it it may well be it may well be that I should have declared it may well be that I should have declared my interest in my very opening words 

but as far as I understand the rules of the House

and doubtless I am open to correction 

but as  as far as I understand the rules

Point of order

 point of order

Mr Deputy Speaker I am not an expert on procedure  and some of the rules of this House quite frankly baffle me and some of them I find irrelevant 

But Mr Deputy Speaker we do call each other honourable member when we address each other in this debate

Is it honourable for a member who 's been on his feet speaking for five minutes to quite cynically after it 's been pointed out to him that he was in breach of the rules of the House to suddenly say

it was in my notes

I Mr Speaker came down here especially today on the very early train to represent a constituent Cliff Clifford Hutchinson who is an honourable man a very honourable man who was on Christmas Island who now every day of his life is in pain

And to listen to

They are meant to

They are designed to

O order

Order

Order

Order

Order

Order

The honourable lady mustn't anticipate the next debate

The honourable gentleman 

Order 

Order

Order

Order

I 'm on my feet

Order 

We are all honourable members in this House

And every honourable member knows very well what the very strong conventions are namely that if there is an inter a direct interest in the subject under discussion well then the honourable member uh concerned declares his interest

That is well known in the House

Mr Summerson

Point of order

Point of order

The honourable member said that he was about to announce uh he was about to make a statement referring to the initials C S

Is that Crooked Swindler 

Well Mr Deputy Speaker as I understand the rules of the House members obviously have to declare an interest 

As far as I understand the rules they don't state exactly where in the course of his remarks the member is supposed to state that interest 

And if the House will give me the opportunity I will eventually get onto that part of my speech in which I do declare that interest 

Now Mr Deputy Speaker as I was saying 

I was talking about the history of sites of human settlement and I was saying how the same site can be used over literally

Point of order

Mr Corbin

It was pointed out to you a short time ago that honourable members are supposed to declare their interests in a speech 

The member concerned announced he was about to come on to declare his interest and then has veered away from the subject again

Could you ask him now 

or could I ask him through you if he would now state exactly and explicitly what interest in insurance property banking or anything else he has that might have a bearing on this bill that that is going through a debate at the moment

Order

The honourable member is free to make his own speech in his own way 

Mr Summerson

Thank you 

Is it not in accordance with your ruling a few minutes ago and indeed with the conventions of the House generally that of course  a member who has to declare his interests should do it at the beginning of his speech so that members should be able to judge what he 's saying

'nd surely if a member decided he was only going to declare his interest at the end of his speech a large part of the uh provision would be made void

So I do hope Mr Speaker you will urge the honourable member to make the declaration of interest which himself has said he was going to make but which so far he hasn't done

Order

Order

Order

Order

I have  a strong impression that the honourable gentleman who has the floor is about to clarify the position

Order

Order

Order

Now I appeal to the House with the with the sense of fairness that we always have in this place

The honourable member is about to clarify the position and I think he should be allowed to do so

Mr Su order

Order

Not until the honourable gentleman has clarified his position

Mr Summerson

Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker

I will most certainly bow to your ruling and I will state that I am I am a chartered surveyor and I will also state that I am the director of a property company from which I have from which I have drawn no remuneration since June nineteen eighty-seven

It is called Palatine Properties Limited and the honourable gentleman can go and look it up in Companies House any time he chooses 

Now Mr Deputy Speaker

Point of order

Order

Mr

Mr Deputy Speaker I 'm not a usual reader of Erskine May but I have studied Erskine May on this matter

And on page three hundred and eighty-five Declaration of Interests in a Debate it says quite clearly and explicitly

a member will normally declare his interest at the beginning of his remarks

page three hundred and eighty-five 

Order

Order

It is a it is a matter for the honourable member concerned to decide  what is the appropriate moment for him to declare his interest

The honourable gentleman has said he did say the word normally

The honourable gentleman  has

order

Order

Order

The ho

Order

The honourable gentleman is a fairly new member of this House

We all have to order

We all have to absorb experience

The honourable gentlem gentleman has in fact order

The honourable gentleman has clarified the position and I think the House should accept that and allow him to get on with his speech

Mr Summerson

Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker

Order

Now order

The House knows that this matter may be debated on the Queen 's speech specifically tomorrow and again on uh Monday

I think

so I ask for single questions please

Uh  Sir William Clark

Would my uh right honourable friend agree that this is a very tight public expenditure settlement

And both he and the  Chief Secretary are to be congratulated 

In view of the fact that although the pundits in the media and the press have been saying there 'll be an overshoot of some twelve billion pounds on public expenditure if one ignores the reserves there 's only an an s overshoot of some four and a half billion pounds

And despite our difficulties more and more money is being spent on capital projects not like the last Labour government who reduced who reduced public expenditure on the National Health Service and on roads

And isn't it about time the opposition stopped talking down Britain and our economy

I think uh I think in his last remarks my right honourable friend asks for more than is likely to be delivered 

It is perfectly true that this is a surprisingly tight package to many commentators

It does keep public spending at two hundred billion when many expected larger increases 

The share of expenditure the national income remains unchanged when I think many expected at this stage of the cycle that it might increase and we still expect as I indicated earlier a substantial debt repayment in the present fiscal year

It is a tight settlement

It was necessary to be a tight settlement

And we will continue to keep a tight control of public expenditure

Mr Alan Beith

Mr Speaker is it not clear that when you skip away s strip away the skilful and ingenious presentation this this statement amounts to cuts in many areas and inadequate investment in the key areas of transport training and education  because the Government has to fund the massive inflation which it caused and because the Chancellor still has to leave room for the kind of income tax cuts which the Prime Minister keeps talking about without abandoning all semblance of fiscal respectability 

And will the Chancellor confirm that the underlying rate of inflation will remain high throughout next year that inflation minus mortgage interest relief will be high throughout next year

Does he regard that as a serious problem

and what is he going to do about it

We expect underlying inflation to fall also next year  in so far to broadly to broadly the level of the headline rate

In so far in so far as the individual programmes the honourable gentleman mentioned uh are concerned I 've already indicated to the House that something in excess of half a billion pounds is being added to the education budget largely to finance the very dramatic increase in the number of students in higher education

And the plans imply at least as much capital spending in schools and colleges next year uh as in the current year

On on transport the priority this year uh

since there have been huge transport increases in each of the last two surveys the priority is the extra nearly six hundred million pounds mainly for the Jubilee Line extension the East West Crossrail and services for the Channel Tunnel

It is a very good settlement for public transport for we are determined to produce an efficient effective public transport service

Mr Terence Higgins

As it 's very important for the long term trend of public expenditure to decline as a percentage of national income would my right honourable friend agree that the primary role of the rate of interest must now be to keep uh sterling within the limits of the Exchange Rate Mechanism and as a result fiscal policy has become more important than ever before

And against the present ba economic background are not the increases in planned public expenditure he has announced entirely appropriate if we are indeed to avoid the dangers of recession

And in that context is not the increase in transport expenditure which he 's just announced particularly appropriate 

Uh I entirely see the point that my right honourable friend has made

He is of course entirely right about the necessity of remaining uh within the uh bands in the exchange rate mechanism that w that we are committed to and equally entirely right that we will need to keep a very firm control of the trend rate of public expenditure in future years 

Mr Sheldon

Yes

Uh may I press the Chancellor further on this question of the underlying rate of inflation  because when of course the underlying rate was the gr less than the R P I they made a great deal of that

Now it 's likely to be more than the R P I can we not have his forecast of the underlying rate of inflation excluding mortgage interest at the end of next year the fourth quarter

As the right honourable gentleman knows as a very distinguished former Treasury Minister the underlying rate of inflation has never been published for perfectly understandable reasons

Mr Wardle 

Mr Speaker what happened to my right honourable friend 's forecast last year for the surplus on an on invisibles and to his belief that negative growth in G D P would be avoided this year 

If his forecasts this year go even slightly astray just how disinflationary will two hundred billion pounds of spending be

Is there not a are there not lessons to be learnt from nineteen seventy-three seventy-four 

We do in fact have a surplus on invisibles this year

And I would expect there to be a surplus on invisibles next year

So I think the underlying premise of my honourable friend 's uh question is perhaps inaccurate

Mr Radice

Uh does

does the Chancellor of the Exchequer agree that as the planned uh spending total to a large extent reflects the Government 's failure to control inflation and the mess over the poll tax there will in fact be little room for improvements in vital public services

On the other hand  will it not the the increase in the public spending total actually disturb the markets

In other words aren't we in danger of getting the worst of all worlds disturbing the markets without satisfying the public 

Well of course if the markets listened to the honourable gentleman that would undoubtedly be the case

But I suspect what the markets will notice is that we have kept a very tight control of inflation in the circumstances that prevail

And I think the markets will welcome the fact that we have been able to do so

It is clearly important that we do

Mr Stewart

Uh now that my right honourable friend has announced the first part of his budgetary package on public expenditure and has shown very welcome restraint on the public expenditure totals will he not hesitate when the time comes to be equally austere in presenting his budget in the spring uh since a tight fiscal policy is the best foundation for restoring economic growth 

I am i grateful to my right honourable friend for his early budgetary representation that I will consider with great care

Mr William Ross



No

I 'm not at this stage anticipating a a a public borrowing requirement

As I indicated in my statement our our our medium term policy is to remain nothing worse than balanced in uh in terms of uh in in terms of public borrowing

I hope we will keep to that fiscal balance

We have a surplus this year against the expectations of many commentators

Mr Tim Smith

Mr Speaker is my right honourable friend aware that his statement today on public expenditure is most welcome because he has succeeded in containing the increase in spending below that necessary to accommodate inflation while at the same time providing substantial additional resources for priority programmes

But doesn't the substantial increase in cash spending next year show the urgent need to continue to press down on inflation

And will my right honourable friend continue to take a tough uh stance on both monetary and fiscal policy

I entirely uh I entirely agree with everything said by my honourable friend and see no need to add to it

I could not myself have expressed it as well

Mr Leadbetter 

Mr Speaker the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his statement earlier on indicated uh that he was still aware of the volatility of oil prices 

Now  is the Chancellor aware that today there has been reported a seventy per cent seventy per cent increase to one point one billion pounds for the Shell Oil Company and it is therefore reasonable to deduce that there will be comparative increases for other oil companies

Does he not accept that the volatility of oil prices is beneficial for the oil companies but the higher prices for the buyers of oil namely the motorists and industry is disadvantageous

Would he not agree  that a lower profit margin and a more reasonable price margin would remove a serious element from the serious areas of inflation that concern the House at the moment 

That point has I believe been examined by the M M C as the honourable gentleman will know

He 's quite right that the volatility of oil is a a damaging uncertainty in the projections that we must make in this country and that other countries must make as well

It is for that reason that I have taken the assumption similar to that taken in many other areas of an oil price down to twenty-five dollars by the end of nineteen ninety-one 

Mr Nelson

Is my right honourable friend aware that on this side of the House we fully support the contents as well as the style and tone of his statement this afternoon 

Uhm

and uh will he accept congratulations as well as the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on showing a a clear matter of political judgement in the priorities they 've given to increased health spending

But would he agree that if we are to increase as we must expenditure on these areas it would be quite improper at a time when our constituents are having to tighten their belts if they were to be faced with an increased burden of taxation next year 

I am uh grateful to my honourable friend for his kind remarks uh both to me and my right honourable friend the Chief Secretary

As my honourable friend knows I do believe my right honourable friend has produced a remarkably successful out-turn to the public expenditure round

I do think it is uh important to sustain the expenditure on health

and on this occasion we have managed to increase it in real terms by five per cent again

I note the point my honourable friend makes about taxation

But as he will know uh I must only consider that in the period between now and the budget

Mr Fraser 

Rooflessness as he calls it

going through the roof

How many extra how many extra homes to rent will be provided by the public sector as a result of this statement 

My right honourable friend will be making that clear in his own statement

Mr Budgen

Mr Speaker since my right honourable friend is promising very substantial increases in public expenditure will he confirm that there will be room either for substantial cuts in interest rates when it is safe to do that or for cuts in taxation but not for both 

My uh honourable friend is well aware that I cannot comment on the prospects for taxation

And I have no intention of doing so

In so far as interest rates are concerned uh I will not cut uh interest rates until I am absolutely satisfied that it is safe and secure to do so

Mr Salmond

Am I correct in uh thinking that the Chancellor has assumed two thousand seven hundred million pounds for oil revenues in the current year bringing to a round total of ninety thousand million the total to which Scottish oil revenues have bankrolled this government over the last ten years

Can the Chancellor tell the House what has happened to the additional r revenues from the North Sea due to higher oil prices running according to the brokers ' forecasts at twenty million pounds a day

How much of that has gone to the oil companies

and how much to the Chancellor

I 'm sure the Chancellor will appreciate the anxiety of people in Scotland today to find out the answer to that question given the announcement of further steel closures and further abandonment of North Sea steel markets to the Japanese and the Germans

May I  may I congratulate  I congratulate my right honourable friend  o on standing up for the interests of the people of this country

May I ask her whether she thinks  that the eleven are not now both isolated and intransigent in relation to  agricultural policy and the GATT round 

Does she think that they are deliberately working  for a failure of the GATT round in order to achieve their objectives of a fortress Europe 

If that is the case does she not agree that this is not a destination to which we want to go

Mr Speaker my right honourable friend is right

The European Community is the only group of nations which after years of studying the problem has not tabled an initial negotiating position on agriculture in the GATT round

The United States has tabled one

Japan has tabled one

The Cannes group have tabled theirs

Canada

Switzerland

From the Community nothing

And it really is a disgrace that we haven't even been able to agree on a negotiating position let alone start to negotiate with all the other groups by by between now and the end of the year

Yes

I agree with my uh right honourable friend that several countries in the Community are highly protectionist that the Common Agricultural Policy is a protectionist policy that we were trying to produce the protectionism uh first because it would help the third world secondly because it would mean that we do not have export subsidies and take therefore business away from other countries and thirdly because we in this country do believe in open trade

It is serious

It was the most serious thing that we discussed at the at the at the European Council

and I most earnestly hope that this time agricultural ministers there 'll be no difficulty with us but the French and German agricultural ministers will accept the proposals of the commission for the negotiating position in the Uruguay round

Mr Ashdown

Mr Speaker does the Prime Minister  realise how welcome it was  that we heard in her statement that she has at last been forced to admit  that the  hard ecu proposal can be a transition mechanism to a single currency 

Would she congratulate both her Chancellor and her Foreign Secretary in levering her forward towards reality on that matter 

Does she  realise that that is good news for Britain

But does she realise how much bad news for Britain it was in her performance at Rome 

Does she realise that she has in a single meeting  isolated this country in Europe  weakened weakened our voice in Europe  divided her Cabinet and betrayed this country 's long-term best interests

Mr Speaker does the Prime Minister realise that if she faced a Labour Party which was not equally divided equally muddled equally confused on this matter she would today face a motion of no confidence in her failure at this historic moment

Does she realise 

Does  does  does  does

Order

order

Does she realise

Order

Does she realise that  does she realise that for as long as she hangs on to power  so long will Britain be held back from its future that she no longer speaks for Britain she speaks for the past

What rubbish 

Oh dear Mr Speaker

It seems that there must be quite a lot of late parrots in Cloud Cuckoo Land if the right honourable gentleman can come out with that stuff

Of course if you have a parallel currency of course if you have a parallel currency and people choose to make more and more use of it it could evolve into a single currency

but that could not be done without a decision coming back to this House and I believe to the people of this country

I take it that the right honourable gentleman 's policy is to abolish the pound sterling  the greatest expression of sovereignty

I think that would be totally and utterly wrong in any event to agree to that now

That is a matter for future generations and future parliaments and Parliament is supreme

not the right honourable gentleman the member of the Liberal party

Mr Robin Squire

In the light of the discussions last weekend would my right honourable friend reconsider in the near future proposals to separate and make independent the Bank of England so that it may buttress our battle in this country against inflation 

Mr Speaker  mostly when banks are called independent they are usually answerable either to Parliament as in The United States where Mr Greenspan is answerable to Congress or they have a number of politicians on their board

I do not believe at the moment the structure that we have in this country would be served well by what my honourable friend is proposing

I think it is far better to increase the amount of democracy rather than to go ahead and reduce it which I believe would be wrong at this time

Mr James Lamond 

What 's the point of the Prime Minister trying to wrap herself in the Union Jack for electoral purposes  and then coming back here  to the dispatch box and telling us that she 's prepared to sell working people in this country down the river by opening this country completely to free trade without any protection whatsoever

Order

Destroy the destroy the multi-fibre arrangement  give the emerging democracies in Europe a thousand million pounds loan to produce goods on wages of eighty pounds a month to flood into this country textiles in particular and enjoy and destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs here

Is that what she was elected to do

Or is she really uh not protecting this country at all but only pretending

Selling it out 

Well perhaps the the honourable member heard some of the comments behind me that better wrap yourself in the Union Jack than the Red Flag

What the hon  what the honourable gentleman has said 

what the honourable gentleman has said is

and I understand his view 

what the honourable gentleman has said amounts to a totally a totally protectionist policy 

A totalist protectionist policy will lead to retaliation against us

It will reduce the capability of our export industries to export and therefore our standard of living

It would make our industries inefficient and therefore cost the housewife a great deal more than efficient industry

I note also that he complains that goods come into this country from third world countries where wages are far lower

but I 've heard him get up several times before and saying

third world countries need help

May I point out they need trade as much as they need aid 

Mr Norman Tebbit 

Would my right honourable friend not agree  that the mark of a single currency is that all other currencies must be extinguished and not merely extinguished but that the capacity of other institutions to issue currency has to be extinguished and that in the case of the United Kingdom would involve this Parliament binding its successors in a way which we have hitherto regarded as unconstitutional

I am grateful to my right honourable friend

This Government has no intention of abolishing the pound sterling

If the hard ecu evolved into much much greater use that would be a decision for future parliaments and future generations

It would be a decision which could only be taken once and a decision which should not be appr approached in this atmosphere but only after the greatest possible consideration

I believe both Parliament and sterling have served our country and the rest of the world very well

I believe we are more stable and more influential with it

I believe it is an expression of sovereignty

This Government believes in the pound sterling

Mr James Molyneux 





I totally agree with the the right honourable gentleman

There are some things in the Community for which there was majority voting when we went in and we accepted that

There have been more things for the specific objective only of achieving the single European act

There is an attempt now to get far more passed by majority voting

That means that we would have laws imposed upon us even though this House more laws was flatly against them

We expect our people to obey the law mainly because it has gone through all the legislative processes in this House

and we should be very slow before we add to any majority competence on the part of the Community

Mr Steve Norris 

Would my right honourable friend accept that there 's very wide support in my constituency for the stand that she took on the I G C on economic and monetary union 

And would she further accept that that support is not based on the niceties of international economics but on the clear and firm belief that those who dictate fiscal policy for the United Kingdom should be fully and directly answerable to the electors of the United Kingdom

I totally agree with my honourable friend

What the Delors Report is proposing is that they should be answerable to no-one

It is very ironic indeed that at a time when Eastern Europe is striving for greater democracy the Commission should be stri ex striving to extinguish democracy and put more and more power into their own hands or into the hands of non-elected bodies

Joyce Quin

 on economic adventures to the Soviet Union

Is it not the case that the British Government is far more reluctant to step in and give economic assistance than the countries of Germany France and Italy

Is the Prime Minister not aware both of the political risks within the Soviet Union if we do not respond generously at this time and also of the long-term risks for British industry if other countries step in and establish the aid and trading relationships with the Soviet Union before we do

Uh Mr Speaker the German banks the Deutsche Bank gave a very considerable loan to the Soviet Union of something like the order of of six billion Deutsch Marks

That had all gone within a matter of weeks

It was in fact guaranteed by the by the Federal Republic government

It had all gone within a matter of weeks and was used to repay debts which the Soviet Union owed to German manufacturers

That has gone

It has if I might say so done nothing to help the economic situation in the Soviet Union

When we got the request for help we suggested that we look not at general loans that wouldn't help a country already in difficulty but to see if we could give specific help in certain spheres such as for example with food processing with transport with oil exploration

It is that we are looking at and also the I M F is looking to see what is necessary for the Soviet economy to do to get it out of the present difficulties

Fortunately between the Houston economic summit and now the Soviet Union has had a windfall in the sense that the increasing price of oil has in fact m gave it a given it a very very much better balance of payments position and has therefore on a much much greater scale than we and therefore has improved its position

We shall make up our mind when the I M F has reported

Cranley Onslow

If these partners of ours in France and Germany persist  persist in blocking the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in December what useful purpose does my right honourable friend think the international governmental conference is likely to achieve 

My uh right honourable friend puts his finger on it absolutely

This  this both agriculture and trade are two subjects where we have as national countries no competence at all

They are all negotiated through the Community

So they can do that

They can even do it in the Agricultural Council by majority voting

But the fact is that France and Germany stick together and refuse to have reductions in their subsidies

Many of the other countries whose farmers are far poorer than those in France and Germany say

how in the world can we agree to lower subsidies when the the coun when the Community 's two sets of richest farmers will not do so

I hope that the compromise solution which the Commission hammered out with agricultural ministers will nevertheless go through because that is only the start of the negotiating position with other countries and not the end

Otherwise we shall be responsible for reducing world trade

We now come to motion number three overseas development and cooperation

Mrs Lynda Chalker

Mr Deputy Speaker I understand it may be for the convenience of the House that we debate items three and four on the order paper together 

Is that agreeable to the House 

So be it

Mrs Chalker

I beg to move that the draft European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Subscription to Capital Stock Order Nineteen Ninety and the draft European Bank becon Reconstruction and Development Immunities and Privileges Order Nineteen Ninety both of which were laid before this House on the thirteenth of July be approved

The explanatory memorandum circulated on the E E C proposal Document Number Five Six Nine Two stroke Ninety for a Council decision on the conclusion of the articles of agreement establishing a European bank for reconstruction and development  is most relevant

And I greatly welcome the interest of the House of Commons Select Committee on European legislation which has recommended a debate at an early stage

Mr Deputy Speaker I spoke with the chairman of this Select Committee the honourable gentleman the member for Newnham South

and I explained that in the short time available  I understood that it had not been possible to arrange the separate debate recommended

But I look forward tonight to a thorough debate on the orders  and on all aspects raised by the establishment of the new bank

And it may be helpful to this house therefore  if I also deal with the points arising from the Community document 

The House will acknowledge the extraordinary change in central and eastern Europe

Yesterday 's dictatorships have been replaced by today 's reborn democracies 

The spurious certainties of centrally planned economies have given way to the opportunities and disciplines of the free market 

And the free world has reacted quickly to this momentous process and must continue to do so if it is to help and influence events

And it would be difficult to find a clearer example of quick reaction and long term commitment than this new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development or B E B R D which we are di discussing tonight 

It was only in December last year that that the European Council decided at its meeting in Strasbourg to establish as soon as possible a new European Bank to further the implementation in central and eastern European countries of democracy and economic reform 

I shall have more to say about the purposes of the new bank in a moment 

That decision in Strasbourg set in train a process of urgent but careful diplomacy 

Preparatory discussions began in Paris in January this year and continued almost unbroken until the articles of agreement established establishing the bank were signed by representatives of its forty-two prospective members in Paris on the twenty-ninth of May

Will my right honourable friend give way 

I am grateful to her for giving way

Could she describe uhm whether any of the negotiations and the European countries involved ever consulted any one of their Parliaments  or or presented any document whatsoever to any of their national parliaments or indeed to the European Parliament during the course of these negotiations 

I remember uh Mr Deputy Speaker uh that after the European Council at Strasbourg my right honourable friend the Prime Minister reported to this house on the sort of procedures that would be undertaken 

Further to that we got on with the basic organisational work which was purely organisational work

And subsequently uh to that we have presented as I shall come to this later an explanatory memorandum to the Select Committee on Community uh Matters  and indeed have carried through the work that was necessary in order to bring us to a position to implement the decisions taken at that Strasbourg uh Council last December 

And it was my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and our Ambassador in Paris uh who signed for the U K and the European Commission and the Irish eh Presidency who signed on behalf of the Community 

But the approval to of the House to the two draft orders is requested tonight before the Government moves to ratify the agreement

The agreement could not even have been considered further unless it had been signed by all the members back in May

Equally the scrutiny aspect will need to be resolved to the satisfaction of the House

And it was this matter on which I consulted with the chairman of the Select Committee 

Now members of the new bank will include the world 's leading economic powers all members of the organisation of economic cooperation and development including Japan The United States and of course all European Community member states the European Economic Community itself and the European Investment Bank 

All the emerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe have signed and are potential recipients 

Assistance from the new bank will be an important element in their continued progress towards political and economic reform 

But this new bank has attracted support not only from the free market West but also the old Communist East 

Egypt Israel The Republic of Korea Mexico and Morocco have signed the articles too

So it is truly an international effort and we must ensure that the impetus of this effort is maintained 

The articles of agreement will come into force and the bank will come into existence only when ratified by signatories representing two thirds of the total voting power including at least two countries from Central and Eastern Europe 

It is thus imperative that the process of ratification be thoroughly compete completed

but quickly 

France has already done so 

We want to exercise our vote when the first decisions are taken on bank strategy and investment proposals

And as host nation the United Kingdom wishes with the consent of both Houses of Parliament to the draft orders to be among the first to ratify so encouraging early ratification by others 

The President Designate Monsieur Athalie wants the agreement to enter into force early next year so that the bank can begin quickly to make its vital contribution to the development of eastern European economies and hence underpin the emerging free markets

Just a moment

This would be consistent with the leading role that this Government has taken in encouraging reform in eastern Europe and in insuring that the Community responds positively to it

 right honourable 

Why does my right honourable friend use the word vital

Is that a mere puff to try and excite us about the size of it

or does it actually mean that this is going to be a very substantial and subsidised institution that 's going to be spreading a lot of the taxpayer 's money around eastern Europe 

Mr Speaker Sir I follow precisely what my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has said in this matter 

We intend  uh that this bank should provide the stimulus for private investment in Eastern Europe  not to be  uh a drain on the resources of the British or any other taxpayer but to stimulate the development of the central and eastern European economies  that we know they are well capable of 

The need to have capital to start up is obvious and understandable

but I cannot divert from anything my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said in this respect on the first of May in this House when she reported back from the European Council in Dublin which of course also discussed the matter as well as the European Council in Strasbourg last December

I give way to the honourable gentleman 

I am most grateful

Since this money is going to be invested in eastern European economies as seed money and so forth I wonder if it really is very sensible for the Government to spend ten thousand million pounds on Trident nuclear weapons which are presumably going to be aimed at the ver very self-same  economies

Uh I mean isn't it going to be  investing money with the threat of mass extermination and destruction of the same investment 

Mr Speaker Sir I don't think if I strayed into the uh realms that the honourable gentleman tempts me into tonight I would have your support

I will not therefore follow down that path

But let me get on with this debate

I 've already given way to my honourable friend the member for Wolverhampton once

and I would like to continue because we have simply an hour and a half 's debate and I do not wish to cut the time of backbenchers to participate in this debate by giving way I suspect to other  uh points of order 

Mr uh Deputy Speaker I think it would be helpful if I set out the Government 's view on the proposal for a Council decision on Community ratification of the articles 

I mentioned earlier it was the Strasbourg Council of the eighth ninth of December last year which set in train the detailed negotiations which led to the articles of agreement 

This was very much an initiative of the heads of government of the twelve 

It is acknowledged in the majority shareholdings specified in the articles of the member states of the Community  the Community itself and the European Investment Bank 

The Board of Governors of the E I B has already authorised its membership as it is entitled to do under the E I B statute 

If approved the proposed Council decision will authorise Community membership of the E B R D

As is usual in these cases we think the Community should ratify only when all member states have done so 

The draft decision is presently before the European Parliament

And we expect it to come to the Council in the autumn

It will require unanimous approval by the Council of Ministers 

Under the proposal the Commission would have the right to appoint the Community 's own Governor and Director and rep would represent the Community within the E B R D alongside member states and other shareholders including the European Investment Bank

The Community and the E I B will each hold three per cent of voting power 

The House will want to know the financial implications 

The Community 's capital subscription will be for three hundred million ecu about two hundred and twenty-five million pounds of which the paid-in element will be ninety million ecus about sixty-five million pounds

Our share of the E E C capital subscription based on our current share of the E E C budget would be approximately forty-five million pounds of which fifteen million will be paid-in 

I hope that the House will agree it is important uh for the Community to become a member giving it a voice in this new institution and to do so quickly for the creation of which this Community and the twelve members can take much of the credit for the Bank 's existence and future 

It 's possible that the draft Council decision may come to the Council in the autumn while the House is still in recess 

The United Kingdom may thus be asked to give agreement in the Council before Parliament reassembles in October 

As host nation and a leading member of the new bank the United Kingdom would not want to delay unduly its entry into force

I hope therefore that the House will agree after tonight 's full debate when honourable members have had the opportunity recommended by the Scrutiny Committee to look in detail at this that we should proceed

 minister for for uhm for mentioning this point 

but uh of course she will know that the orders which we have before us tonight for the reasons that she exp has explained  uh come before the final decision and final ratification of the uh articles which we have in the uh regulation which we are not formally uh looking at tonight 

Would she agree that uhm if there is discussions necessary  there might perhaps be another debate  after it 's all set up which will not of course be before the decision  but uh may be afterwards when the full details are known

Questions to the Secretary of State for Employment

Question number one

Mr Ken Eastham 

In April nineteen ninety the Health and Safety Executive embarked on a year-long recruitment campaign aimed at increasing specialist inspectors in posts across all disciplines including construction

Eastham

Does the minister is the minister aware that uh nineteen eighty-eight nineteen eighty-nine was the all time historical figure of five hundred and fourteen fatal accidents and these were mainly in the construction industry and it is believed that ninety per cent of these fatal accidents could be avoided

Isn't it about time that the Department really got itself organised to avoid all these unnecessary deaths which are taking place which could be matched providing there was a real determination by the minister to do a proper recruitment policy

Well I can agree uh with some at least of what the honourable gentleman says

He is entirely right to draw attention to the fact that in construction it 's been estimated in the black spot construction report that some ninety per cent of fatalities were preventable some seventy per cent by management action

I think the uh mistake which the honourable gentleman makes is in assuming that uh one can automatically cut accidents and fatalities simply by increasing the number of inspectors

Certainly the uh requests of the Health and Safety Commission have been met uh in recent years

But ultimately responsibility for preventing fatalities and industrial injuries has to lie with those who are actually engaged in the work place 

Mr Tony Lloyd

 Will will the minister i in that case confirm to the House whe whether it is the the the case that the the H S C 's plan of action has been returned to the H S C by the Secretary of State

and is this connected with the H S C 's bid for a further seven million pounds of funding

And when the minister told the House that all their bids in previous years have been accepted recently will this present bid be met in full 

Well

let me tell the honourable gentleman that obviously the Health and Safety Commission needs to discuss with my right honourable and learned friend the question of their plan of work

uh those discussions have taken place and my right honourable friend has made it clear that uh sufficient resources to be able to carry out that plan will be found from within our own resources

And therefore the assurance which I gave the honourable gentleman 's honourable friend a moment or two ago remains true

Mr Patrick Thompson

Number two Sir

Mr Speaker the work force in employment in the United Kingdom stood at twenty-five point four million in June nineteen eighty-nine and twenty-six point eight million in June nineteen eighty-nine an increase of one point four million over the period

Patrick Thompson

Mr Speaker is my right honourable friend aware that during a similar period of time the number of people employed in the Norwich area in the city of Norwich has increased by five thousand and this at the present time is coupled with a continuing downward trend in unemployment in Norwich particularly among women

Does my right honourable friend agree that all this will be put at risk if the policies of the opposition were put into effect with the disastrous effect that would have on East Anglia

I entirely agree with my honourable friend

There can be no doubt whatever that the policies which would be pursued by the party opposite would work not only to the detriment of my honourable friend 's constituents very serious though that would be but to the detriment of the country as a whole

Mr James Lamond

Before the minister gets too complacent about these  will uh he bear in mind that within them there 's concealed sectors such as textile and clothing who 've been faced with very massive reductions in the number of employees in those sectors and in particular recently Courtaulds have been closing mills in the north-west of England

Will he see that those who are negotiating on behalf of the Government and through the E C that the multi-fibre arrangement is retained for at least another ten years particularly as it 's so necessary to keep the the textile industry on its feet 

Well

of course those matters are taken into account by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry uh in the negotiations to which the honourable gentleman refers

But what uh the country has increasingly learned over the last eleven years is that the key to success is to adapt to change and not simply to preserve existing patterns of employment wherever they may be

That is the basis for the extra one and a half million jobs uh now twenty-seven million that have been created in this country uh one and a half million more than in nineteen seventy-nine

Mr Riddick

Mr Speaker can my right honourable friend confirm that this country ha has a higher proportion of its adult population in work than any other country in Europe

Doesn't he agree with me that the greatest threat to the excellent figures which he 's announced this afternoon c come from some of the madcap Socialist policies which have been put forward by the European Commission and Madame Papandreou which would simply make it more expensive and more bureaucratic for employers to take on more employees 

My honourable friend 's analysis of the social action programme is entirely accurate

There is no doubt at all that those proposals would destroy jobs and would make it infinitely more difficult for us to maintain the record of success uh which has been uh uh in place now for these uh last several years

Clare Short

I wonder if the Secretary of State understands

and if I can help to persuade him perhaps he can explain to his back benchers that having a high proportion of one 's work force in employment is not a sign of being a developed healthy economy that Britain is backward in the numbers of our young people who are not in education and our low levels of training and that in fact Labour 's programme that places great emphasis on this will help Britain to catch up with the rest of Europe rather than fall steadily behind as we have done under the policies of this Government 

I fancy Mr Speaker that if there were fewer people in work in this country that wouldn't be regarded with a a an entirely welcoming inac attitude by the uh by the party opposite

Uh I uh believe that the fact that we have a record number of jobs in this country is something of which we can justly be proud

It gives the people of our country the opportunities for employment and for earnings which they want

Uh and uh it is shameful that the policies of the party opposite would act to the detriment of those opportunities

Sir Peter Thurnham

Number three Sir

By ending abuses of trades union power such as secondary action and flying pickets which disfigured British industrial relations for so long our legislation has helped to attract massive overseas investment to this country to create record numbers of new jobs and to reduce the number of strikes to the lowest level for more than fifty years

Fair enough

But would my honourable friend remind the public of the dangers of repealing this legislation and going back to the anarchy of trade union bosses and their flying pickets

Will he go on reminding the public that those are the policies that the opposition want 

Well

my honourable friend is entirely right to draw attention to the fact that uh any conversion by the party opposite to the virtues of responsible trades unionism is extremely short-lived and skin-deep as well

and indeed my honourable friend will bear in mind the uh comment uh of the honourable gentleman the member for Sedgefield reported in his letter in The Times yesterday where he glibly described lawful secondary action

He said it would be unwho wholly unfair to ban it 

Maria Fyfe

 it probably have

by the way they have stopped abolishing wages councils

And if this is so is this because they are ashamed of their actions and might restore the wages councils that previously existed

Well I can well understand that in a question which uh highlights the deficiency of uh deficiencies of the party opposite the honourable lady would want to talk about the wages councils

Perhaps we can talk about that on another occasion

The point aris the point the point the point ar of the point arising out the point arising out of this particular question is the fact that the trades union reforms which this Government have introduced have been overwhelmingly popular with the public and are seriously under threat as anyone who takes the trouble to look at Labour party policy in detail will see

Mr Barry Porter

Mr Porter

number four

Mr Speaker since June nineteen eighty-seven unemployment in the United Kingdom seasonally adjusted has fallen by about forty-four per cent and by just under one and a quarter million

Mr Porter

Somewhat strange that

uh

the Labour benchers find the undeniable fact that there are more people employed in this country than ever before is somewhat sad and the sign of an underdeveloped country

I fail to understand that

But perhaps Mr Speaker my right honourable friend would confirm that the more important figure is that our unemployment uh level is well below that of our European partners

And could I again join with my right honourable friend in seeking reassurance that the bizarre and restrictive schemes of the social aspects of the policy should be brought to the attention of our partners so that we can point at our record in job creation 

Well my honourable friend is uh absolutely right

We have the lowest rate of unemployment in the European Community with the exception only of Luxembourg and West Germany

There is no doubt at all that the policies which have led to our success in job creation would be substantially uh more difficult to carry out if the social actions programmes were implemented

And I lose no opportunity to point this out to uh my colleagues within the European Community

Doctor John Reid

We are informed that the demise of the no threat in the steel industry in Lanarkshire would produce unemployment figures which even the minister practised though he is couldn't fiddle 

Does he recognise that if the steel industry in Scotland and Lanarkshire were to go unemployment in the Lanarkshire area would be thirty-three per cent among males would be thirteen per cent among females and twenty-five per cent overall

If he intends to try and fiddle those figures would it not be easier for him to make representations to his colleague at the Department of Trade and Industry and ask him to get off his butt and do something to save the steel industry

Well Mr Speaker my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland has made clear the Government 's concern about the future of the steel industry to which the honourable gentleman has referred

But if the honourable but if the honourable gentleman will look to see what has happened elsewhere in the United Kingdom he will find that adjustments have taken place on such a scale as to as to ensure that the rate of unemployment in various parts of the United Kingdom which were most affected by closures in the steel industry are now lower even than the national average in this country which proves that it is possible to adapt to change in a highly successful and effective manner

Maureen Hicks

Does my right honourable friend agree that the tremendous reduction in unemployment that we see in the West Midlands owes a great deal not only to our legislative changes but also to changes of attitudes in the work place parti particularly in the manufacturing work place 

And would he not agree that the co-operation of the workers now to become multi-skilled not only makes them more flexible and viable in the work place but also adds to the career potential of those individuals

Now would he also like to add his good wishes to two companies in my constituency who this week have received the Queen 's Award for Export and Technology namely Lucas and Yale

Questions to the Secretary of State for Wales

Question number one

Mr Ray Powell 

My right honourable friend the Secretary of State met health authority chairmen on the tenth of July and more recently at a briefing seminar in Cardiff on the nineteenth of October

He intends to meet them again early in the new year

Mr Powell

I thank the uh undersecretary for that reply and I wonder whether or not during these discussions they discussed the development of phase two at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend

In nineteen eighty-three his uh honourable friend the Minister promised me that phase two would be developed immediately on the completion of phase one

I don't want like the summit in Europe last weekend a no no no from the Minister

I want a positive reply because the people in my constituency two a quarter of a million people waiting for more than seven years and trying to do with half a hospital

Isn't it about time this government fulfilled some of the promises that their Ministers have made

Well

I appreciate the uh strong strength of feeling of the honourable gentleman and indeed of many of his constituents on this issue

and I also note how pleased they are with the new hospital which they do actually presently have

Uh

I would also point out that the question of the phase two is one for his own uh district health authority uh which has decided not to put it in its current ten-year programme 

Mr Kim Howells

Is the Secretary of State aware that uh a rumour circulated in south Wales that guidelines have been issued by the various health authorities which dictate that if patients suffer heart attacks over the age of seventy they should receive less priority treatment than those who suffer similar conditions under the age of seventy 

I don't think the honourable gentleman should listen to such rumours 

Yes Mr Wyn-Griffiths

Can I ask the Secretary of Sta the the Minister the Undersecretary to reconsider uhm his reply on the issue of the Princess of Wales hospital phase two because uh whilst the health authority have to make decisions on the capital spending programme the truth is that despite the extra money being put into the health service in Wales it has not kept pace with the rate of inflation and as a result this hospital promised in nineteen eighty-three has not yet been completed

And I would inform the Minister that the consultants of the hospital do feel that they have been betrayed by the Welsh Office

and wouldn't it be uh a a sign of real faith and uh in the health service for them now to declare that the extra funding will be provided so that the health authority can go ahead with this hospital

I think the honourable gentleman i is uh underestimating the extra funding which he mentioned which has meant that the increase in real funding that is after inflation in the health service in Wales has risen by about fifty per cent under this government

I would have thought too uh that uh the uh consultants and others uh he mentioned would also be pleased with the uh uh treatment centre and the amount that was spent on that in Bridgend in the old hospital

Uh Barry Jones

Mr Speaker does the uh Minister know that uh this year the waiting list in Mid Glamorgan has increased by thirty-two per cent and that since nineteen seventy-nine Mid Glamorgan has lost six hundred and seventy-nine hospital beds which must be lunacy

And will he acknowledge that the Royal College of uh Nurses in Wales is very concerned about underfunding and about the situation regarding waiting lists when all they wish to do is to deliver their professional care to more and more people

They are very very concerned

May I warn the Minister that uhm the people in Wales are losing patience with his policies towards the health service

These policies will lose him his seat and his government power

The honourable gentleman must uh have a very cool mind when he considers that under his government the increase in uh treatment of patients of wa in patients uh was six per cent as compared to some thirty-four per cent increase in patients under ourselves

and out-patient treatment fell by three per cent

And in point of fact he mentions the waiting list in grid Mid Glamorgan

I think it 's worth pointing out that in the uh to the year thirty-first of March of this year it reduced its in uh urgent in-patient waiting list by fourteen per cent reduced the number of urgent in-patients waiting one month or more reduced its out-patients waiting list by six and a half per cent or one thousand one hundred and twenty-two and reduced the number of out-patients waiting three months or more

Uh Michael 

I meet and have discussions with carers and their representatives throughout Wales frequently in the course of my ministerial duties and most recently last Friday at the launch of the Upper Afon Valley Elderly People 's Project 

Mr Speaker is the Minister therefore aware of the worry amongst carers at the undermining of the principles of care in the community

Would he accept that there is now inadequate support for carers in the community

Would he admit that his strategy for community care is to depend on carers without providing for carers

and would he accept that it 's totally inagdequate inadequate to provide the sort of answers he has given regarding care in the community and that there is no confidence in a system where finances are hidden within the revenue support system and that there is now real fear of neglect in the community for both carers and for those for whom they care 

I 'm I 'm very disappointed the honourable gentleman has repeated this parrot cry that he doesn't trust local councils with the extra money which they 're receiving through the revenue support grant in order to carry out community care

I would have thought that it was the uh flexibility given to councils to provide care in the best way possible that he ought to be trusting to

In point of fact of course he ought to appreciate that this government is absolutely committed to its community care proposals a and we and we

he knows perfectly well that a pro uh that resources are already being provided

and he will also know of the increased uh support given uh in the uh announcement last week by my right honourable friend the Social Security Secretary 

Mr Ron Davies 

Mr Speaker I 've had a number of discussions recently with the farming unions and the government has taken a number of positive steps to help the uh Welsh livestock sector 

Would the Minister confirm the figures being used by the Farmers ' Union of Wales which indicate that farm incomes in the hill areas have  been reduced by thirty-seven per cent over the levels which applied in nineteen eighty-six

Does he understand that if the Prime Minister has her way and brings about a further thirty per cent cut in farm support there 'll be a catastrophic effect on the  unemployment on the environment and on the culture of rural Wales

In the light of that will the Minister take it upon himself personally to intervene to see that alternative measures are put in place to offset the worst effects on those who are will be hardest hit 

First of all uh Mr Speaker I thought the honourable gentleman 's own party supported the thirty per cent reduction

uh it may well be there 's been a change in policy

I think if there has he owes to the house to make that clear

It is it is now it is now agreed that there should be such a cut

Discussions are continuing as to how that cut should be implemented on nineteen eighty-six levels

So far as the the uh Welsh farming industry is concerned I have constantly made it absolutely clear that a healthy agricultural sector is absolutely vital for the future economic environmental and social health of Wales

We have taken a number of steps including the advance payments on sheep annual premium the increase in the suckler cow premium and of course the cost of beef intervention which last week was running at about six million pounds in that week

So the government is doing what it can to assist this very difficult position



My right honourable friend will be aware from his meetings with Pembrokeshire farmers of the serious concern that is felt in the farming industry at the present moment

Can he give the house an assurance that if the GATT negotiations are successful and there are phased reductions in subsidies over the next few years that these will be properly managed incremental and that other alternative that other alternative means of support are given to farmers especially in the field of environmental improvement 

Mr Mr Speaker of course I will very carefully consider what my honourable friend has said

I think he is right to highlight the uh very serious situation which would arise for Welsh agriculture if we were to enter a trade war and thus see many of our better export markets destroyed

That certainly would be a catastrophe for the Welsh farmers

and I certainly obviously am keeping very closely in touch with with these negotiations which I very much hope will be suc uh successfully concluded

and he is of course absolutely right to say that any changes must be gradual and incremental

Richard Livsey

Will the Secretary of State indicate what representations he 's made to Brussels prior to the cutback at the weekend announced of only one third of the farms being included in the less favoured areas in Wales

and indeed two thirds of those recommended by the Welsh Office were excluded

Could he tell us what representations he made to avoid that 

Well gentleman will be aware that uh with the with my right honourable friend the Minister for Agriculture we had worked out what we felt to be a very reasonable bid a very reasonable bid to the European community

I have yet to receive formal notification of their decision but I believe the bid was realistic and achievable and I very much hope it will be successful

What I would urge him though to do is not unless the press report is incorrect start contacting in particular the French to urge support for their attitudes in agriculture because I don't think that 's going down very well in Wales

Mr Bill Walker

Does my right honourable friend agree  does my right honourable friend agree that the livestock sector in Wales as indeed in Scotland and other upland parts of the United Kingdom is an essential part of our strategic plans

Order order order

It 's the United Kingdom parliament uh

Mr Walker

Yes

does my right honourable friend agree that the livestock sector in Wales and as in Scotland and other parts of upland parts of the United Kingdom is an essential part of our strategic planning so that we can supply the food and resources to meet these island 's requirements and the problems lie within Europe where they cannot reach a decision on matters that are fundamentally important

I 'm very glad that we get uh that level of support from my honourable friend uh from a Scottish constituency

It is vitally important that everybody realises throughout the community how important a healthy agricultural livestock sector is for the future of Wales and for the future of Scotland

Barry Jones

Mr Speaker will the Right Honourable gentleman admit that the small family farm is struggling desperately that financial disaster stares it in the face that he cannot expect our people to suffer in silence when deeply in debt and cut to the bone

Mr Speaker isn't it the case that the Right Honourable gentleman has no coherent policy whatsoever

What we want is for the right honourable gentleman to use the full weight of his office

We are getting tired of a cosmetic approach an oversanguine approach

There is a crisis and he must act now

I completely uh agree with the honourable gentleman uh in the importance of this subject but I did not detect an alternative policy coming forward

I believe when he examines these issues he will see he he will see uh that the important uh factor to bear in mind from the point of view of Welsh agriculture is that we must continue to support the family farm in Wales

We have very efficient farmers but that is why we have so much to lose from a trade war and I was very sad that he made no expression of opinion on that important aspect

Questions to the Secretary of State for Employment

question number one

Mr Dafydd Wigley

Number one Sir 

This year around six thousand seven hundred people with severe disabilities are benefitting from the sheltered placement scheme 

Is the Minister aware that there are some two hundred and seventy thousand people with severe disabilities who are in open employment another hundred thousand who are looking for employment and that compares uh to only six and a half thousand that he just mentioned that are being uh offered opportunities in the sheltered placement scheme

In view of the success that Germany is having where there 's some ninety thousand people in such a scheme will he consider introducing the levy type system that exists in Germany to penalise those employers that don't offer opportunities to disabled people 

Uh Mr Speaker the honourable gentleman is referring to the figures that are in the Employment of Handicapped Report and they are very encouraging

They show that very very substantial numbers of people with severe disabilities are in fact in open employment

But of course we do need to continue to provide uh special placements for for for others

But the honourable gentleman refers to the situation in Germany

We are not persuaded that this is going to be the right approach but we certainly are looking at the whole range of ways of supporting people with dis disabilities in employment

Thurnham

 encouraged by the survey showing that nearly a million people with substantial disabilities are in employment

Does doesn't that add support to the campaign for for the new logo for firms employing uh disabled people 

I think my honourable friend is absolutely right

We think that the most effective approach to supporting people

There 's no disagreement uh anywhere in the House

It 's very important to help people with disabilities into employment

The most effective way of doing that is through persuasion a and encouragement

and the initiative to which my honourable friend refers I think is an important one which we hope many companies will take up 

Mr Jack Thompson 

Two Sir

Mr Speaker I 've discussed various matters with the T U C on a number of occasions including at the National Economic Development Council

Mr Speaker the in in view of the new consensus thinking that seems to be entering the Government 's mind will they consider will the Minister consider or the Secretary of State consider encouraging his right honourable friend the Prime Minister to to uh advocate urgent tooks talks with the T U C because of the in the potential increase in unemployment and the problems we 've had over the last eleven years with the unemployment problem 

Well there 's no evidence that the T U C have an agreed policy on this matter

Uh uh they certainly didn't uh make any such agreed policy plain at the recent uh meeting of Neddy to which I referred

Uh if anyone has any specific uh uh proposals to put forward in relation to unemployment then uh I should certainly be happy to uh consider them 

Mr Bruce

Has uh my right honourable friend uh had a chance to discuss with the T U C uh the Social Charter and how that might effect unemployment in the United Kingdom particularly the high rates of uh uh tax which would have to be put on employees to pay for the type of social uh benefits that are are paid out in Germany that are extorted at a very great cost to those particular people and the companies that employ them 

Mr 

I have uh indeed held a discussion with representatives of the T U C uh on the European Commission Social Action programme

Uh

I 'm afraid that uh those representatives of the T U C who attended that meeting uh seemed oblivious to the consequences of the extra costs in excess of three billion pounds a year uh which would be a consequence only of the part-time and working time directives which are being put forward by the Commission and the loss of jobs which those directives would undoubtedly cause 

Mr Ron Leighton

Sir unemployment has risen for seven consecutive months

and as after eleven years of Conservative government the country is being forced into deep recession isn't that a conclusive evidence of the failure of Conservative policy 

And instead of entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism being a solution to all this isn't it likely to inflict an extra million unemployed on this country 

No

the honourable gentleman the chairman of the select committee knows very well that we have two million more jobs in this country now than we had in nineteen seventy-nine  that unemployment is forty-five per cent lower than it was in nineteen eighty-six and that we have one of the lowest rates and that we have one of the very lowest rates of unemployment in the whole of the European community

Those are matters uh which are more worthy of congratulation than the criticism uh which uh uh characterised the honourable gentleman 's question

Mitchell

Will my right honourable and learned friend make absolutely clear in any discussions he may hold with the T U C that now that we are members of the Exchange Rate Mechanism excessive wage increases are the fastest possible way to increasing unemployment 

The Exchange Rate Mechanism makes it absolutely clear that employers must keep all their costs very rigorously under control uh

And clearly uh their labour costs are a very important component

so it 's extremely important uh that all who are concerned with ne wage negotiations should uh think carefully about the consequences of their actions uh and think to uh the future not simply to uh what might happen in the very very short term

Mr Roger Knapman

Number Three Sir

Thank you mis thank thanks uh  thank you Mr Speaker 

Mr Speaker my my my apologies for my my slowness in in rising to my feet

C can I uh say to the Secretary of State that if his protestations about uhm all that the Government 's done uh are right whether unemployment 's going to go up on Thursday or down

And if it 's going to go up as uh I think most people in this this House would believe can the Secretary of State tell us whether he really is intent on k making the three uh hundred and sixty-five million pounds ' worth of costs in in employment training and training for the long-term unemployed in the next financial year

or will he in fact make sure there 's more money going in for training for the long-term unemployed 

Mr Speaker I 've said previously that uh unemployment is likely to continue to go up over the next few months

But uh what I 've also said is that we have been reviewing the best way of helping the unemployed back into jobs

That is not always through employment training

Uh we can offer uh a great deal of help in other ways

and that 's why we are proposing to make up to an additional one hundred thousand places available in job clubs and through the job interview guarantee scheme to help people back into work as soon as possible 

Now Mr number three Sir

Mr Speaker this consultation exercise showed clearly that the vast majority of companies and business organisations who responded recognised that the European Commission 's proposals will add very significantly to their costs and will therefore reduce their ability to create and sustain jobs 

Mr Knapman

But can my uh right honourable and learned friend confirm that under these proposals one and three quarter million people part-time workers earning less than forty-six pounds a week will be required to pay national insurance

How could anybody employers or otherwise support such mean measures and what is the position of the party opposite 

My honourable friend is absolutely right

The party opposite uh in their their blind devotion to the social action programme regardless of its consequences uh uh seem seem totally to have forgotten the uh words which they uh repeatedly utter uh in which they proclaim their devotion to the cause of the low paid

The low paid would suffer most from these proposals of the Commission 

Mr Kirkwood

 if the Secretary of State has had any feedback from uh the C B I and employers ' organisations about the the proposed E C regulations on night working restrictions

Uh is he aware that there are some three million employees up and down the United Kingdom who presently work night hours and that the restrictions will make it very difficult for some of the traditional industries particularly in in rural areas where where night working is an essential part of their uhm re regime

The honourable gentleman is uh absolutely right

and uh I welcome his support uh on uh this uh issue

Uh his party is not renowned for uh its determination to stand up to proposals which emanate from the European Commission

Uh I hope we can derive from his words some confidence uh that they will support our efforts uh which are indeed supported by the C B I and other organisations to resist these extremely damaging proposals 

Mr Batiste

Would my right honourable friends agree that this issue highlights the necessity of having a workable and enforceable definition of subsidiarity in the heart of the Community 's constitution so that those things which have to be determined at a European level are limited to those things uh which in fact need to operate across boundaries 

In principle my honourable friend is absolutely right

But I don't think he should underestimate the difficulties which we might face in achieving a satisfactory definition of that term 

Mr Martin Flannery 

Mr Ken Eastham

Number five Sir

Staffing is an operational matter for the Health and Safety Commission and Executive who are free to deploy their resources as they choose within an overall funding level agreed with my right honourable and learned friend the Secretary of State

The Commission 's plan of work for nineteen ninety ninety-one includes a targeted increase in EMA staff and posts from a hundred and thirty-four to a hundred and forty-six 

Martin Flannery

uh Mr Ken Eastham

During the past ten years there 've been such serious cuts in the Employment Medical Advisory Service when one considers that there are eight thousand uh on average occupational deaths uh due to occupational diseases

And why is it further that uh in nineteen seventy-nine there were seventy-nine uh doctors and in March nineteen ninety there are now forty-four

And the same can be said about nurses in the occupational service

There were eighty-seven in nineteen seventy-nine and now in nineteen ninety March there are forty-nine

Why is the government not raising their priorities on this serious matter 

Well the answer to the honourable gentleman Mr Speaker is that uh my department uh acknowledges the expertise and independence of uh the Health and Safety Executive and Commission

and I hope the honourable gentleman would share that view with me

If he does then I hope that he will he will approach the Health and Safety Executive and talk to them about why these numbers have changed because he would he would be told

Uh he would be told that the reason is that they have appraised the use of the resources and have redeployed them in a way which they consider to be more effective in tackling the problems that the honourable gentleman has quite like rightly raised

So I invite him to look at it in that light to acknowledge the expertise and independence of this excellent body and then to understand why they 've made the changes that they have made

Mr David Atkinson

Six Sir 

There are no such plans

I 've no reason to believe that there is any need in England for a scheme of government assistance specifically targeted on tourism projects

Well

I mean it 's obviously important the Government puts its case

but I 'm sure the Secretary of State wouldn't want to mislead the House

I mean he must know that the National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses is passionately angry about this measure feels that promises that were made to them in the past have been breached and thinks it 'll be very destructive indeed both for sick people and their businesses

I mean that 's on the record

That is their view

And he shouldn't pretend that businesses welcome this because they certainly don't 

I don't I don't think I I don't think I made any such pretence

I sought to make a sensible or what I take to be a sensible and balanced comment uh on what my honourable friend had said

And I would say to the honourable lady uh as I 've said to my honourable friend that I hope uh later in my speech when I 'll give some examples of what might be the effect on uh uh some representative smaller employees with a a a representative incidence of sickness and then looking at what they uh they would uh uh uh as it were gain in the reduction of the third National Insurance contributions for employers which have been specially focused on those lower earning ba earnings bands below about a hundred and seventy-five or a hundred and eighty-five pounds a week

Uh

Would my right honourable friend oblige

Yes indeed

Uh I 'm grateful to my right honourable friend

Would he confirm that some of these representations that have been made were actually formulated before the operating statement uh earlier on

Yes

many of them were made before the very significant improvements that he announced in Social Security benefits and might well have a changed complexion if that were taken into account

I think it is certainly the case that uh s uh the representations for example the ones to which the honourable lady referred from the National Federation of uh the Self-Employed were made and I put it slightly more specifically were made before they had the details of the reductions that had to take place in employers ' National Insurance contributions

Yes

I think if the  uh well I the the representations I had seen I think these must be later ones

The representations I had seen if I remember rightly were dated the sixth of of November

I 'd need to check this

And of course it wasn't until the eighth

Is that right

It wasn't until the eighth of November that I gave at the time of the Chancellor 's autumn statement the full details of the rerating proposals on National Insurance contributions

And it is also worth noting that the reduction in National Insurance contributions for employers was actually rather larger uh both in percentage terms and in absolute money terms than I had indicated uh would uh uh uh would be the case at the time of the Social Security uprating statement itself

In other words the actual proposals when I had refined the detail was somewhat more generous than those that had been signalled at the time I announced the S S P proposals

And it may well be that there hasn't yet been a full opportunity to take into account uh to the extent that I would obviously wish the advantages for employers of the reductions that are to take place in National Insurance contributions which as I will say later in my speech uh total some two hundred and fifty million pounds

They 're really quite a significant sum uh taken overall

Uh

but as I have said uh th there is no doubt that small employers uh do need to have their interests taken particularly into account in proposals of this kind

I have sought to do that

And it tr it is right also I think to note that very considerable strides have been made in recent years in the improved presentation uh of guidance on statutory sick-pay which has done a great deal to increase employers ' and perhaps especially small employers ' understanding of the scheme

Moreover the development of software packages for those employers with computer pay-rolls and I accept that this is not true of all small employers but it 's true of a growing number have further eased any operational difficulties that may originally have been experienced 

Now uh uh I referred earlier in my remarks to the growth of occupational sick-pay coverage which had occurred during the nineteen seventies 

Since S S P was introduced in nineteen eighty-three occupational sick-pay coverage has continued to grow 

At first it was more selective and this is a point which may well emerge uh later in the debate

It did tend initially to apply to white-collar rather than to manual workers

But gradually as the expansion of occupational sick-pay schemes have continued the schemes themselves have become more and more compra comprehensive 

As I think the House knows

Uh yes indeed

If for the Secretary of State because on this point uh when uh his right honourable friend the former Secretary of State the member for Sutton Coldfield introduced the Social Security and Housing Benefit Bill on the twenty-third of November nineteen eighty-one he said that the latest available estimate was almost ninety per cent of full-time employees were in some sort of occupational sick-pay scheme

I think the latest estimate which he has given is ninety-one per cent through a survey that was done for this department in nineteen eighty-eight

Ninety per cent to ninety-one per cent does not exactly seem to be a great increase uh i in coverage 

It is certainly the case that the coverage of occupational sick-pay schemes is very substantial and in particular that there has been a tendency uh to bring into those schemes more uh part-time workers for example and to have schemes which provide a more comprehensive coverage uh with the result that many of those groups uh who are sometimes adverted to as people who have missed out if you like in these developments uh have been increasingly brought in uh as uh I was about to indicate

And I realise this is the point the honourable gentleman is uh is raising the research carried out for the department by an independent organisation uh I F F Research in nineteen eighty-eight uh showed that some twenty million of the workforce that is as the honourable gentleman says ninety-one per cent uh are working for employers with occupational sick-pay schemes

And as I 've said on a number of occasions for example in the uprating may I just finish this uh this sentence before the honourable lady uh comes in again uh that does I think reflect and it 's something which in my view is right and proper that there is a growing acceptance by employers of much greater responsibility to cover short-term sickness among their employees

I give way to the honourable lady

I 'm gra I 'm grateful to the Secretary Of State

We we know he chose the words in the operating statement very carefully

Ninety-one per cent of the worf workforce wor work for employer employers who provide some occupational cover

And that does not mean ninety per cent of the workforce are covered

And the honourable gentleman should know most low-paid part-time short-term workers are not covered

Nearly half workers in the private sector are not covered

It is misleading to talk as though ninety per cent are covered

It 's probably only half the population at best that are covered 

I think the honourable lady will find that the figures are rather uh uh wider than that but it is certainly right

And I 've no desire to I hope I always chose my words carefully

I certainly have no desire to mislead anybody

It is certainly the case that the position is uh that ninety-one per cent of employees work for employers with occupation sick-pay schemes

But what I was seeking to say to the uh to the honourable gentleman is that in practice the nature of those schemes has become more comprehensive uh over the years and there are fewer people who are excluded from them than would 've been the case uh in the in the past

That is the best assessment uh we can make

uh

and indeed uh it leads me

May I just before the honourable gentle

It may b may be helpful if I if I  complete the next set of remarks in my speech

then I 'll gladly uh give way to him

A particularly striking feature of the report which as I say we commissioned in nineteen eighty-eight is the growth in coverage in manual occupations 

That has grown from sixty-two per cent of employees in nineteen seventy-four to eighty-eight per cent in nineteen eighty-eight only five per cent behind coverage in non-manual grades at ninety-three per cent 

The report also indicates that the majority of schemes eighty-three per cent in the private sector top up S S P to full basic pay and that overall nearly three quarters of all employees receive their full salary

That 's three-quarters of all employees uh in these schemes receive their full salary when sick

That is a very encouraging development and does very clearly demonstrate the extent to which employers have increasingly accepted responsibilities in the field of short-term sickness

Now I give way to the honourable gentleman if he wishes to come in

I do indeed uh uh

This whole bill is premised uh on the view uh that uh occupational sick-pay uh is now extremely wide and is increasing

That is the whole basis of this Bill

Will the right honourable gentleman face up to the point that my honourable friend was making to him uh that forty-four per cent of private uh sector schemes do not have occupational sick-pay and indeed uh more than a maj more than a a a majority uh fifty-five per cent of private uh sector pay schemes with more with uh uh fifty-five per cent of private employers with less than ten employees do not have an occupational sick-pay scheme

The ninety per cent figure he keeps talking about is totally irrelevant

It is grossly misleading

and will the right honourable gentleman accept that there can be no justification for a Bill where the premise uh is does simply not exist 

I I don't I don't accept that for a moment

In the first place I think a figure as striking as ninety-one per cent uh of employees working for employers with with occupational sick-pay schemes can hardly can hard can hardly be said can hardly be said to be less than striking

In almost any other field including uh uh some of the electoral matters with which uh the honourable gentleman and I are concerned a ninety per cent figure would be taken as extremely high 

And secondly and secondly even even with many employers who do not have what could be described as an occupational sick-pay scheme they may well uh have a practice of continuing to pay people for some significant amount of time when they are sick

So I don't think that I anything that I have said can be described as misleading

And indeed I think if anything it is the way in which the honourable gentleman is seeking to minimise the extent to which there has been an improved acceptance by employers of their responsibility towards short-term sickness amongst employees

The way he 's seeking to minimise that I think is far more misleading than anything that I have said 

Thanks then for giving way because I do believe this point is crucial

If the Government is saying it 's going to change the whole basis of National Insurance on the basis that people have got cover or that ninety-one per cent of the people have got cover then we need to be clear about that figure because we profoundly disagree with that figure

And I would just put him to him the one example

If there is an occupational sick-pay scheme at the work place it may well be that the only person receiving that occupational sick-pay scheme could be the managing director

and none of the other workers could be receiving anything at all in the way of actual benefits

Isn't that the truth of the situation

So it 's not the people that are covered but the work places which could imply that the people themselves are not actually covered nowhere near the rate at which he is suggesting and basing his argument

Well I I have to say that in in some sense I 'm drawing some encouragement by the use from thi from the encouragement of that sort of line of argument in this debate 

Uh

if the honourable gentleman can produce to me uh well I 'm I 'm tempted to say one but certainly any significant number of examples of occupational sick-pay schemes uh confined to the managing director then I might give some credence to his argument

But I beg leave to doubt whether he could find a single such scheme uh let alone any significant number

Uh

would my right honourable fr friend agree that whilst we still have a disappointing number of young people over the age of sixteen staying on to further education it 's vital for the career development of young people and also the needs of our economy that we offer each and every young person who wants it a tailor-made training which truly assesses their individual needs hopefully much as there is the need of industry particularly skill shortages and most of all guarantees them a good qualification which will be welcomed in the workplace and be

I entirely agree with my honourable friend

The combination of new youth training and the training and enterprise councils uh offer us the best possible prospect of achieving the objectives which my honourable friend has identified

Mr Leighton 

Would the Secretary of State please try to do better this year in protecting the budget of his department than he did in last year 's autumn expenditure round when several hundred millions were lopped off of the expenditure on E T and Y T

And in particular will he uh note that the London Borough of Newham feels cheated along with twenty os other local authorities who wanted to co-operate with the government on T B E I and has now found the cash cut back substantially

Does he not realise that investing in the technical and vocational education of our young people is the best use for public money 

Well

the honourable gentleman who follows these matters closely as Chairman of the Select Committee will know that over the last uh four years funding for training has increased by sixty per cent in real terms at a time when unemployment has halved

That 's the context in which uh this year 's settlement has to be seen 

Mr  Mitchell 

Mitchell

Can my right honourable and learned friend confirm that two members of the England World Cup football squad first acquired their footballing skills under a Y T S scheme 

Can  can he ca  can he confirm  can he confirm  Mr Speaker can he confirm  Mr Speaker can he confirm that the same opportunities under youth training for people young people to develop their World Class footballing skills will also be available 

My honourable friend is entirely right 

David Platt and Paul Gascoigne who combined to score the goi the goal which put England in the quarter finals of the World Cup  were both Y T S trainees 

Mr Speaker I am confident that youth training will enable the England World Cup team to do even better in nineteen ninety-four than it did in nineteen ninety 

Mr Blair

Tony Blair

Will he confirm that even after the recent Cabinet discussions and despite the chaos caused by the cut in the youth training budget for this year he still intends to cut next year 's budget by over a hundred and twenty million pounds

What went wrong 

Did he lose or did he simply not fight 

There is no chaos as the honourable gentleman knows perfectly well

And as I said to his honourable friend the Chairman of the Select Committee a few moments ago uh and as he knows perfectly well uh spending on training has increased over the last four years by sixty per cent in real terms at a time when unemployment has fallen by fifty per cent

That is a measure of the Government 's commitment to training 

Mr Michael Stern

Number six Sir 

The number of work permits issued to Hong Kong nationals during the twelve-month period ending on the thirtieth of June nineteen ninety was eight hundred and sixty-eight 

Mr Stern

I 'm most grateful to my my my honourable friend for that answer

And could I take this opportunity of congratulating him on on his latest appointment

That is very nice

Could I ask my honourable friend to offer some reassurance  uhm to those that are concerned of the total number of permits to be issued under the British uhm Nationality of Hong Kong Bill

That the permits by means of people coming to this country and applying for permits once here will not be used as a means of circumventing the provisions of that Bill 

Well I think I can give my honourable friend the assurance he seeks

The strict conditions of the main work permit scheme will not be relaxed for Hong Kong citizens

And of course under the main scheme work permits will continue to be issued to only to Hong Kong nationals who 're recruited by employers for employment in high level jobs for which employers are unable to fill from resident labour

Mr Madden

Will the Minister confirm that come the  single uh Common Market that three hundred million E E C nationals could and I emphasise could seek employment in this country without the need to obtain a work permit

And against that background does he not agree that the number of work permits issued to Hong Kong nationals pales into insignificance

Well Mr Speaker of course uh European nat Community nationals will be able to seek jobs in this country and British nationals will be able to seek jobs in European Community countries

Sir Geoffrey Dickins

Is my honourable friend aware that a few years ago there were a lot of illegal work permits issued from his department

Has he been has he been in the department long enough to know for certain that this practice has ceased 

Well  I thank my honourable friend for that question

When I 've got my feet under the desk uh may I say when I 've even seen the desk I shall certainly look into his point 

Mr Peter Archer

Number seven Sir 

Mr Speaker Convention A Hundred And Eleven was adopted by the I L O in nineteen fifty-eight

Every United Kingdom government since then has declined to ratify the Convention and the present Government has no plans to do so

Mr Archer

But is the Government proud of the fact that standards in this country are so far below those of other countries 

And is their reluctance to ratify this convention possibly connected with the findings of the committee of experts that the Government is in breach of those I L O Conventions which it has ratified 

Certainly not and Convention A Hundred And Eleven has nothing to do with standards

Uh indeed the act of Parliament which is expressly inconsistent with Article A Hundred And Eleven is the Race Relations Act of nineteen seventy-six passed at a time when the right honourable and learned gentleman was Solicitor General 

Mr Coombs 

Is my right honourable friend aware of the growing level of concern about the difficulty faced by ex-offenders in obtaining employment

Will he undertake to look at this matter with a view to improving the regime under which they seek jobs 

My honourable frien friend raises uh an important uh matter uh and uh one indeed which uh does give rise to concern

Uh

I entirely accept his concern

and it 's something which we are taking forward with the training and enterprise councils in a positive and realistic fashion

Mr Lloyd 

Mr Speaker can I congratulate the Secretary of State on his productivity today which is uh enhanced over on previous question times

Can I can I ask the Secretary of State simply this

The the uhm does the Government have any difficulty with those parts of the I L O conventions on employment which allow for greater disclosure

And in particular would he accept that the concept of disclosure would mean that the report by the H S E 's Accidents uh Prevention Unit into the Channel Tunnel where so many people have died and where there is clearly uh uh a real problem with management should be published should come into the public domain to make sure that we can have a sensible and rational debate about the quality of safety on that particular project 

Well the honourable gentleman will know that reports of the kind to which he refers are compiled by H S E in reliance on the full co-operation of employers and it 's very important if that co-operation is to be uh continuing and available in the future that confidentiality should apply

Uh that is why it 's unlikely that that particular report would be published

But the honourable gentleman will know with the recent action taken by H S E in relation to the Channel Tunnel

Mr Tim Boswell

Number nine Sir 

Between December nineteen eighty-eight and December nineteen eighty-nine the number of self-employed people in the United Kingdom rose by nearly two hundred thousand to reach three point three million 

Mr Boswell

Thanking my honourable friend for that reply and congratulating him on his translation would he confirm that that is the tenth successive year of increase in self-employment and that the figures are now some three quarters higher than they were when this Government took office

And will he take it from me and my own experience that it 's a very satisfactory way of employing oneself and serving the customer 

Yes

indeed I think my honourable friend has made the point uh better than I could because we know that the the main hope for the future in terms of the wealth creation and growth in employment is precisely the growth of the self-employed sector

We have demonstrated as a Government that this is something that we welcome and that we encourage

Our track record is excellent and we intend to maintain it in that way

Clare Short

I don't suppose the Minister 's had time yet

but if he looks at the figures for income of the self-employed he 'll find very large numbers of them have very low incomes indeed

Given the stress his government places on self-employment is is he willing to look at the possibility of securing better standards of protection against unemployment sickness and indeed levels of income for the self-employed most of whom are very low paid workers indeed 

Uh

the answer I think must be no  because the great strength of the self-employed sector is precisely that most of these people do not want the kind of intervention or interference or even pseudo-protection that the honourable lady suggests

The self-employed are vigorous uh self-maintained people

and they want simply to be allowed to get on with wealth creash uh wealth creation and job creation unencumbered by the sort of things that the honourable lady 's asked for

Mr Butler

Does my honourable friend agree that the number of self-employed people would be much higher had the Inland Revenue not engaged in a campaign of classifying whole groups of people from self-employed to employed 

Uh well

Mr Speaker on my first day in this job uh I m welco welcome the sort of advice that my honourable friend has given

He 's given me a broad hint as to the sor sort of directions I might look in in order better to discharge my responsibilities

and I 'm very grateful to him

Mr Jack Ashley 

Number ten 

Mr Speaker Sir the Conservative document Employment and Training for people with disabilities which was published on the twenty-ninth of June sets out various options for encouraging the employment of disabled people

I shall be considering what action to take in the light of the comments we receive

Mr Ashley 

Uh is the Secretary of State aware that good intentions and guidance may influence good employers  but it won't affect bad employers who discriminate against disabled people  and that is why the United States  is enacting legislation outlawing unjustifiable discrimination 

And as many workers in Britain who are disabled suffer discrimination why can't we have the same kind of legislation 

Well

Mr Speaker we see very considerable difficulties in the way of uh following uh the path which uh the United States government has uh chosen

but that is one of the uh matters on which we 've consulted in the document uh

and I certainly wouldn't want to prejudge the results of that consultation in responding to the honourable gentleman this afternoon

Mr Speaker  I subscribe entirely to the recent statement by the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster  that nothing demonstrates more dramatically the collapse of moral consensus in Britain today than the prolonged and at times bitter debate over issues of love and life marriage and the family 

Equally important are the profoundly moral arguments over the origin of life  the status of the embryo and the freedom to experiment on and then destroy human life in its first fourteen days 

Medical ethics is now a contradiction in terms 

From the time of Hippocrates until the early post-war period  doctors took the oath 

They don't do so any longer  because it 's become a farce  the oath contained an explicit undertaking not to cause harm to a child in the womb 

Until quite recently the medical dictionaries and textbooks made it plain that human life began at the moment of conception 

Not any longer

Recent editions are evasive  not because of any advance in medical science but because specious ex post facto justification is sought for abortion  and now for experimentation on little children 

That is why that is why they need to be taken together in this bill 

I am I 'm most grateful to the honourable member

Would he explain how of these ext the the remarks that he 's just made about little children will actually take place

I I didn't quite understand that

I 'm I 'm I 'm coming to this

Yes

I 'm coming to this

One of the real worries about allowing research on embryos within the first fourteen days  is that it could lead to wider forms of research than are intended by parliament 

As an example of how the abandoning in law of the basic medical ethic can lead to unforeseen consequences we only need look no further  than the Abortion Act of Nineteen Sixty-Seven 

Nor need I look further than my own city of Sheffield  where the percentage of termination of pregnancy continues to be considerably higher than the average for England and Wales  and the section on handicapped children Section Four is invoked  for less than one per cent  of all those numbers 

Nor is there anything illogical in combining legislation on abortion and embryonic research  despite the objections heard in one of the opening speeches 

For a human embryo is a human embryo whether it is in a test tube or in in utero 

A rose is a rose not only by any other name but no matter where it is  and at what stage of its development 

It is not illogical therefore to view the human embryo as the kind of thing that should neither be killed in certain circumstances nor used for certain research purposes

Would the honourable gentleman give way for one point

Would he not agree with me that it 's totally incongruous that today we have in National Health Service hospitals and others doctors fighting to save the lives of children born at twenty-two weeks for parents who desperately need them and further along the corridor they are doing exactly the opposite for a child at twenty-six twenty-eight weeks

Yes

It is it is it is more than incongruous 

it is downright immoral 

The vital decision

Well  I hope didn't hear someone sniggering at the mention of the word moral because they 're going to hear it a good deal more before I sit down 

The vital decisions that we reach

Morals can't be confined to individuals 

Morals don't arise from individual preferences

They 're not based on utilitarian consequences

I suggest my honourable friend consults the meaning of the word 

The vital decisions we reach on human fertilization and embryology and subsequently pregnancy termination must affect how we regard the status of each individual  his or her human rights the treatment of the handicapped the fate of the senile and the terminally ill 

How we treat human life at any of its stages is of the highest moral significance

Once we 're convinced that we have the right to determine when life becomes human and when it ceases to be so  then we stand in danger of creating a society that is potentially self-destructive 

We need to proceed with the greatest care therefore  for embryo research is a complex issue which involves the whole spectrum of medical scientific ethical  and moral issues 

It also abounds in myths and partial truths 

The first is the notion that freedom to experiment on human embryo  is necessary to help infertile couples 

But is this so 

A recent article and correspondence in The Lancet on benefits of in vitro fertilization  raised important questions about the cost of I V F  its benefits and the ratio of cost to benefit 

Other critics of I V F point to its experimental status its uncertainty  its as yet unappraised risk factors and the divergent rates of success 

This doubt was raised in a report of the World Health Organisation 's regional office for Europe entitled Are In Vitro Fertilization and Embryo Transfer of Benefit to All 

There is a remarkably  lack of scientifically-based assessment of rates of success worldwide which has led inevitably to doubt as to what are the real success rates 

There is also growing doubt as to whether further embryo research is the best way forward  and even increased recognition that assisting fertility does not depend on I V F alone 

For example microsurgery  for women the growth of services for male infertility and new techniques of molecular biology demonstrate that the lack of destructive experimentation would not ipso facto impede the improvements in the treatment of fertility 

There are other methods coming along we 're assured as good or  now increasingly better provided they 're not starved of financial of human and material resources because of the  I V F programme that we all welcome

Of course we welcome results in the I V F programme where we 've met them 

I 'm  godparent to such a child an adorable child

And I know what great joy he 's brought not only to his family but to so many of his parents ' friends 

The second myth is that embryo experimentation is necessary in the fight against inherited genetic disease 

yet it now seems clear from the booklet issued by pro-research group Progress entitled Freedom to Choose that research on the embryo as far as genetic diseases are concerned  is directed not at cure but at prevention 

The public has been misled therefore into thinking that embryo research will produce cures for diseases like cystic fibrosis and Down 's Syndrome and most members present must know this from their postbag 

Will those in favour Madam Deputy Speaker of human embryo research  give the House one example of what they have discovered in research into genetic diseases which they could not have discovered in another way 

Research must continue however as a matter of the highest priority into improving the quality of life for handicapped people 

One of the more consoling aspects of our present dark age is that we now give much more attention to the mentally and physically handicapped than we did even twenty-five or thirty years ago 

On all sides we 're aware of the enormous love and care that a mother and father will have for a handicapped child 

And so I hope that we won't make heavy weather of this particular point during the rest of the debate 

No one who saw Songs of Praise a week ago from Saint Mary 's Cathedral Middlesborough can have failed to have been touched by the spirit of Dominic who has Down 's Syndrome  and inspired by the devotion of his mother Mrs Nora Jones for whom Dominic is all the more as she said precious

In fact she said

and I 'm quoting her

and I have the transcript 



The third and probably the most mistaken and dangerous notion is that the medical and scientific establishment is not violating the sanctity of human life but taking welcome advantage of the newfound uh possibility of researching into fertilized cells before they attain human status 

A unique biological event occurs with the conjunction of egg and sperm

I 'd have thought that everyone was agreed upon that one

The contribution of modern genetics has shown however that the genetic code is really a fundamental organising principle

and there is a radical unity long before the fourteen day stage 

Yet at this stage some honourable members insist and I hope the my honourable friend won't mind my quoting her from the house magazine recently 

My honourable friend said 



Well she 's not alone in that view

It was quoted often enough in the recent debate in the other place

She 's in good company 

But at what stage uh Madam Deputy Speaker in our lives 

all of us present in this chamber were indistinguishable little globules made up of a few cells 

who could have predicted  who should have determined why or whether those globules developed into the different individuals that we are or which globule would develop into which individual 

I 'm very grateful to my honourable friend for giving way

Does he and other members of the house who 've campaigned with him in this issue  agree that ultimately the arguments are about the balance of morality  and that one has to balance the theological view which he has put against the potential benefit to people who if in the absence of further embryo research would end up being disabled for the rest of their lives or other children yet unborn who would not be born because of the interfi infertility of their parents

Two points arise

A calculation about morality really is an incompatibility is it not

It 's a contradiction in terms

And again my honourable friend doesn't understand the meaning of morality

Last week on a visit to Israel I found that the Israeli government was well aware of the dangers of her becoming militarily involved in the Gulf crisis

Uh

while she does of course have every right to defend herself will my honourable and learned friend urge the government of Israel to continue to show the considerable constraint which she has so far shown

and would he confirm that were Saddam Hussein to attack Israel the consequences for him would be very serious 

Uh Speaker we have taken every opportunity to impress upon the government of Israel the need to exercise the maximum self-restraint

They have done so and they deserve the gratitude of this House

Miss Dunwoody

Would the minister when he 's talking with the isqui Israeli government make it very clear that he has noticed those remarks by the P L O leadership which said that they have regarded the whole of the land of Israel as being their birthright and that he will not be either misled confused or in any way uhm  diverted by those who try to excuse Saddam Hussein 's inexcusable invasion by dragging in the whole question of the Israeli settlement 

I can promise the honourable lady that I will not be confused or misled in any of the respects that she has mentioned or I hope in any other

name

 is my honourable friend aware as the Right Honourable member for Ardwick said it is because the the most of the world and particularly the Arab world perceives double standards being employed by many countries towards uh occupation and illegal occupation of neighbouring territories uh that uh there is now an increasing danger of public opinion in countries like Egypt Jo uh Syria and Lebanon uh outstripping uh the aggravation uh which is uh not inherent in the attitude of those governments towards the current conflict in the Gulf

and if we are not careful we 're going to find some of our allies in the present situation totally separated from public opinion in their own country 

Hear hear

And as regards Jor and as far as Jordan is concerned will my honourable friend make Her Majesty 's Government 's position clear as follows that if either Iraq or Israel invades or uses Jordanian territory our attitude towards any such incursions would be the same as our attitude towards Iraq 's incursion into Kuwait

Speaker our attitude towards Israeli policy in the occupied territories is wholly plain and I have taken the opportunity of stressing our policy both to the Israeli ambassador and to their deputy foreign minister

They know well that we regard their occupation of the occupied territories as unlawful and that they should withdraw

Suppose you hadn't been able to raise finance at all  for one reason or another 

What do you think would have happened 

If we hadn't been able to raise finance then I would 've informed Mr Sainsbury and we 'd 've had to have been a we would have had to pay rent to R C Ward

We couldn't 've fulfilled our part in the original purchase 

Such a concession from the Midland Bank which I was saying did not come to fruition



This was by Mr Pete 

Is that right

A a gentleman from the Midland Bank

I don't know his name

A gentleman

You don't know his name

No

A gentleman from the bank came down to see you

That 's right



Uhm

He asked you to produce accounts and trading records

He came to our premises

And we gave him uh trading records bank statements et cetera

And did he make it clear that he wasn't putting in any money

No Sir

He took away all the uh pieces of information which we gave him uhm

And in fact we were subsequently for informed afterwards by him that uh they wouldn't be willing to lend us the money

You said you they would be willing to lend you the money

No Sir

They wouldn't be

afterwards afterwards they said they wouldn't be able to give you some money

After some time afterwards 

Did he give any indication why he wasn't willing

No

Was it a surprise to you that he wasn't willing

No

No

Is it fair to say that your company has not been enormously profitable

In that first year of trading we made a loss 

And you your own bank was National Westminster Bank 

And you already had a very substantial overdraft arranged with them

We did 

So you then sought to raise finance due to A S Consultants in fact

Mr Haddock uh arranged through his solicitor that A S C Consultants would a arrange for the finance for us

Uh you knew when Mr Pete came down that uh Mr Sainsbury 's original suggestion was that Midland would provide the finance for the whole deal

That 's correct 

And you knew that after you 'd been to see him he was perhaps willing to lend you money

he wasn't happy with your business

Correct

Was it not obvious to you the idea of there being a single loan for everybody in the shape of R C Ward at that stage would really have gone by the board

No Sir

I understood that uh R C Ward had already obtained uhm information from the Midland Bank that they would be willing to lend R C Ward the five hundred thousand

It was not conditional  on on my understanding it was not conditional that the other members of the units actually borrowed their money from the Midland Bank  although it was advantageous to do so

Yes

But what I 'm getting at here is is is that the Midland won't lend to R C Ward unless they 're satisfied with everybody 's finances

Did you understand that

No

I understood that R C Ward had gone so far down the road that they had an offer of finance from the Midland Bank and through Pat Hanson 's efforts

Maybe another one or two people

But certainly I was on the of the understanding that R C Ward were able to make this deal because it was a self-financing deal 

And it didn't strike you as anything odd in in that that the Midland Bank as far as as you say should should just lend money half a million pounds to R C Ward simply on the strength of the value of the property without examining the individual accounts

Given their connection with Mr Sainsbury and I 'd understood they 'd had very satisfactory re uh relationship with Mr Sainsbury uhm  I don't see that the Midland Bank would 've had any problem 

But in fact in the case of the Midland Bank 

You didn't know about that

I w I was not aware of that Sir

No 

And then you say you went off to see A S Consultants

Do you remember when that was

Uh it was uhm certainly before Christmas

I couldn't give you the exact date 

Would you look at page forty-three A 

You see that that 's a form

That 's an A S Consultant 's  form

It 's got your details on it

Turn over to page forty-three B

It 's dated twelfth of January nineteen eighty-eight

And uhm is that your signature 

On forty-three B it 's Colin Haddock 's signature I have

I think there may have been a mistake in the copying

Would you look there  either on forty-three C or forty-three D

Forty-three D

Yes

Forty-three D

That should be forty-three D

but don't worry

That 's your signature

Yes Sir

Dated twelfth of January eighty-eight 

Could you explain why it 's not until the twelfth of January nineteen eighty-eight that you 're signing forms to A S Consultants saying that you want to borrow money 

I do

Sorry

I should 've I should 've given you time to look at the forms 

Take as much time as you want to look at them

The form isn't a form in relation to one particular financier

It 's a general application

Yes Sir

Yes

And you said you first got in touch with A S Consultants before Christmas

Now I ask you if you could explain why it 's not until twelfth of January that you signed that application

Uhm I believe we went twice to our uh A S C Consultants

Uh we paid a cheque on the first occasion and also on the second occasion so totalling something like two thousand four hundred pounds as an arrangement fee

Uhm  I haven't got the uh uh information with me but I can actually bring to Court uh the copy of the date of the cheque

But certainly it 's my understanding we went before Christmas to see A S C col Consultants in the first place 

Did you know 

Right

So let me ask you this

Were you aware that that there came a time when a deposit had to be paid by Ward for the property

No Sir 

You didn't know anything about that

No Sir 

Did you know that Ward had secured the property had got the contract

I was not informed of anything other than the original meeting

There were some conversations with Mr Sainsbury popping in and out of our premises urging us to arrange finance

And I I informed him that it was already under way with A S C Consultants uhm

But I was not aware that there was a need to actually come up with any money

I am not aware until in fact this court hearing that there was in fact a deposit paid in December 

Did you not know that Ward in December had actually got the contract

No Sir 

Were you not interested as to whether the scheme was going ahead or not

I assumed that as I heard nothing from Mr Sainsbury apart from urging us to arrange our own finance that everything was going ahead as normal 

At the time of the original action plan of course it was all dependent on Mis Sir Philip Harris agreeing  because at that stage was there any impression of putting something to Sir Philip

I 'm not quite u sure I understand your question

I 'm sorry

It 's my fault

At the time of the original meeting when the actual plan was agreed your  the whole scheme was dependent on Sir Philip agreeing 

As I understood it Mr Sainsbury hadn't had a discussion with certainly Harvest Vack and Field to arrange the necessary finance for R C Ward to continue with the purchase

Yes

But but but obviously Sir Philip hadn't signed the contract to that effect because Ward hadn't signed the contract

The whole purpose of meeting was to decide whether it was worth going ahead at all

So at at the time of the original meeting the whole thing was too unsettled for it to be able to proceed at all

At the time of the original meeting nobody had any idea of what would happen 

Yes exactly

Now what I am asking is why were you not interested to know whether the scheme was going to proceed

Of course I assumed that as Mr Sainsbury was popping in and out from time to time that the scheme was proceeding anyway 

And  you knew that the whole thing had been arranged with great great urgency

Yes Sir 

And Mr Sainsbury was discussing the situation with you regularly 

And he was asking after your finance

Yes Sir 

Do you not think that it would 've been better if there 'd been slightly more haste in your discussions with A S Consultants 

We we acted as fast as possible

We we actually I wasn't aware that we did we had to come up with any money until the third of February

We had been to see A S C Consultants who had informed us that as far as they were concerned everything would go ahead

We 'd parted with our cheque

We 'd signed all the forms

And we went off to the exhibition in Germany fully believing that when we came back we would be the owners of the property at Unit Eight Mill Road 

I 'll come on to when you went off to Germany  shortly 

In your statement on page three the last but one paragraph you say 

throughout the seventh of January Mr Sainsbury discussed the situation

and particularly mentioning the urgency to arrange the funds as the completion date was drawing nearer inquiring how your own negotiations were progressing

Yes Sir 

Didn't Mr Sainsbury make it perfectly clear that he was expecting you to have finance ready in order to complete at the completion date

Uh as I understood it the completion date was to be the third of February

Yes

He 'd said that you had to have your finance by the third of February

Yes Sir

Yes

He made that clear

Yes

And you didn't say that 's not what we agreed

No

As far as I was aware the completion date would be the third of February and we 'd taken all action necessary to actually arrange the mortgage offer before that date 

Well did you understand from Mr Sainsbury that if you didn't have the money by the third of February it would cause problems 

Not uhm in the sense of fantastic problems regarding the initial purchase from Harris

But certainly we would 've had to have come up with some payment of the interim period between the third of February and as it now transpires the date we found out that we 've we couldn't proceed until about the seventeenth of February 

But I I was aware that we had taken all action necessary to arrange finance for the third of February the completion date 

As far as you 're concerned you were aiming for the third of February completion date

and that 's what Mr Sainsbury was urging you to do

As you know Sir it 's an elaborate procedure

We 'd filled in all the necessary forms and had gone away in all innocence believing as we 'd parted with money as well that everything would go ahead on the third of February

And in fact I gave Mr Sainsbury a letter before we went away saying that he should contact Martin Hector in our absence who 's our solicitor 

Do you remember when you first told Mr Sainsbury or his solicitor

Hi his solicitor was David Sherwood

As I understand it Sir yes

Did you not know that

I didn't know that at the time Sir

So you didn't speak to Mr Sherwood

But you must at some time have told Mr Sainsbury who your solicitor was

Yes

And in fact it 's written in the letter which I gave him before we went away who whom he should contact 

That that was in January when you were just about to go to Germany

Did you not tell him before that who who your solicitor was

I don't recall telling him unless he 'd actually asked 

So I am going to show you the the correspondence that goes between between the solicitors

And the first one is at page twenty  turn up 

You see that 's from David Sherwood and it 's addressed to Martin Hector  at Knightsbridge and it 's dated the eighteenth of December nineteen eighty-seven 

It says

completion of term on the first of February when your client it actually says Colin Haddock with regard to your long lease on Unit Eight

So  at that date Mr Sherwood had got the the name but you don't think it was you who 'd given it to him

It may well 've been Sir

I don't recall actually giving the name

It might 've been Mr Haddock

It may well 've been 

You and Mr Haddock kept each other closely informed about about this this matter

We were in telephone contact daily

Yes

Mr Haddock wasn't down on the site regularly

Uh Mr Haddock lives in High Wycombe and we are in Brighton which is some seventy odd miles distant

I see

But you are on the site

Yes 

That 's that 's the letter which goes from Mr Sherwood to Mr Hector 

Had you been to Mr Haddock 's solicitors before

Oh yes for some time

Yes

Mr Carter your full names please

If you wish to be seated you may with My Lord 's permission 

As long as you keep your voice up 

I 'll stand I think thank you

Yes

Uh Keith William Carter 

And you produce your report of the twelfth of June nineteen ninety is that right

That 's correct 

What experience do you have in dealing w with  finding employment or considering the possibilities of employment for various disabilities 

I  For the last fifteen years I 've been involved in the area of education training and employment uhm specifically looking at the  employment and education training needs for those with a disability

I 've a degree in Sociology and a Master 's in Industrial Sociology and I 'm a member of the Institute of Employment Consultants 

Now you 've carried out an investigation I think in to consider the first of all what Mrs Hawkes would have earned had she resumed her career to its full extent

Yes

That 's correct

And then considered alternatives uh

I don't want to take you through your report in any detail

but may I summarize i in this way that the view you formed set out in your report is that if she went back to music in a sort of more or less full-time way including teaching and other aspects of it she would earn of the order of twenty thousand a year gross

Yeah

And each out of those figures is set out in the report

Uh I don't think in making that assessment you took into consideration the possibility of the extra payments musicians receive for videos and things like that

No I didn't

We we looked at concerts concerts uh with rehearsals

Yes

 videos are few and far between

Uh  I 've not

But I would have included that in the recording sessions one-word-sotto-voce

Yes

Now on our page  nine  uh your page seven  you considered the possibility of her returning or becoming a school teacher yes

Yes

And have you had an opportunity of discussing with her what she is doing  what she 's proposing to do

Uhm yes

When w we interviewed her for preparing the report she was uhm making enquiries uh with Croydon College

Uh

I now believe that she 's made further enquiries

and the there 's a prospect of her starting a course next academic year

Yes that I believe 's in January

If she became a full-time teacher

Uh again you set out the salaries on page ten 

And I won't dwell on those for the moment

I 'll come back to them in a minute

Uhm then you considered in section four two of your report the sort of income she could expect doing clerical wor work of that nature yes

Yes that 's right 

Now in relation to the course that she 's proposing to take  would that qualify her to teach in a school

No it wouldn't 

Would it permit her to undertake  or give instruction in further education classes

Yes it would

I the course she wants to follow is a City and Guilds Seven Three O  which is  an in-service provision  or induction provision for those who have existing vocational skills and want to enter further education 

Do you see her  assuming she completes the course  do you see her doing full-time work in further education

I think in the present climate linked with her disability that finding a full-time tenured post will be

A full-time what post

Uh tenured one-or-two-words-very-quiet

Tenure

Tenured yes

Uh so you actually aren't a member of staff

Rather than a a permanent than a

Uh

because of the concerns over funding in further education further education first of all uh posts tend not to be done on a tenure basis but on a year-by-year contract 

Mm

The prospects of getting a full-time or tenured post would be very very difficult 

However it would be possible to obtain hours at different colleges uh making up part-time work 

Quite clearly you are of the view Mr Carter from your report that assuming she can find employment there are jobs that she 's capable of doing 

Yes

When you consider that she might be able to do hours of further education would she earn as much  in respect of those hours as she would in respect of the allowance you gave for clari for clerical work 

Yes it 's  probably most likely it would be a sliding scale coming up to those that I 've suggested

Uh she would need to apply for uh isolated available part-time posts apply for them and win them

Uhm

and then m maybe when she 's actually in post be able to pick up one or two other hours

Yes

But I don't see it exceeding the earnings that 're suggested in my report

Which earnings

The uh 

In fact in 

We don't have a

In the report page fourteen the hourly rate is seven point six to seven point nine 

Yes but I

what I

And in paragraph



What

Assuming she goes down this route and is able to build up a number of part-time uh teaching posts what d' you think she 'll earn

I would say  between four and five thousand pounds 

I wouldn't really want to put it much higher than that

Is that gross or net

Uh gross figures 

Now one or two other matters I think I 'd like to talk about

This 

The green card scheme 

First of all to what companies does that scheme apply 

The 

Well the 

It uh I can't answer the question

Well may I put it in a different way

We 've heard that companies that have a certain number of employees are supposed to take people who have a green card a certain percentage of people who have green cards

That 's right and my confusion was over the question

Those with employers with more than twenty in the workforce should have three per cent registered disabled 

However the decision of whether you hold a green card or not is down to the individual

Yes

I 'm sorry

I don't understand what you mean

There are a number of employers My Lord who will take on people who have a disability

Uh

Uhm who not necessarily hold a green card

But we can forget about that because she does hold one

Right 

Now dealing with that situation with her having a green card  employers that have a workforce of more than twenty employees are supposed to take on three per cent people under a disability

Yes

Yeah

Now first of all  does one need to have a disability of a certain gravity to qualify for a green card

N no it 's uh down to the D R O 's discretion whether a uh an individual is recommended for a green holding a green card

So in fact I have seen cases with people with dermatitis who have green cards

Yes 

Furthermore  can you help us by your experience of this in respect of employers who do have on their staff employees with a green card

What is your experience as to whether or not they take on those employees who have a green card as opposed to continuing to employ people their own workforce who 've developed some disability and obtain a green card

The employers in in the country that actually are up to quota is minimal both in the private and public sectors

The difficulty is that there 's no anti-discrimination legislation to go with the quota scheme so if the employer doesn't do it then they don't do it

There 's no chastisement given 

Really

And in fact uh Rosie Barnes is supposed to be bringing private motion bill in the next session to actually suggest that there should be anti-discrimination legislation

D' you mean there are no sanctions at all

There are in the Forty-four Requirements for Disabled People 's Act

Uhm however it 's uh a hundred pound fine is the maximum uhm and in the time there 's only been six prosecutions under it 

And I think you can give an example Mr Carter 

 local authorities 

In your experience bearing in mind three per cent is the requirement or obligation what sort of percentage in your experience do local authorities have uh in their workforce

Well

they vary greatly

but one per cent

Uh and the local authorities do make an effort and have an equal opportunities project

Uhm one per cent is uh i i is a good record in the the local authorities 

What I was asking you to deal with is the situation where  in relation to that one per cent or three per cent or whatever it is 

if an employer  has already got a workforce  and one of his employees requires a green card for some reason he 's sprained his back or loses an eye  would that person that employee who acquired the green card go to make up the one per cent or three per cent or whatever it is

Yes in fact it 's not

The the secondary ruling is that the a a a an employer that has more than a hundred in the workforce

then something in the chairman 's address uh in the annual statement has to be on those terms uh activity with disability

So often a a a memo goes round asking for those who have a disability to come forward uhm so that the the percentage is uh is perhaps artificially high

But the specific answer to your question is that an employer is more likely to keep someone on and to include them in their percentage uhm than take on a new outside uhm applicant 

Uh uh it 's obligatory is it to have something in a company report

If you 've got more than a hundred in the uh workforce

I 've never noticed it

No

Uhm

It 's usually hidden 

Not on the front page is it

All right

We all must 've read these things but I can't recollect ever having seen a reference

I suppose I was looking for something else and just passed over it

Indeed I

Yes 

Now assume Mrs Hawkes goes into the labour market as a one-armed person

and assume her to be in a good state of health apart from having the disability that she 's got limited use of her arm 

How difficult is it going to be for her to find employment 

I think it would be very difficult both because of a combination of factors of her lack of transferable skill and her her disability  and the fact that she has no proven work record

So an employer in competition with a high number of others will have to take a risk on whether Mrs Hawkes can actually cope with with the job 

What do you think her best bet is

In terms of 

I I think she has to

In fact she was asking us to help with her her future

She doesn't know where to turn uhm

And I think based on her past skills and experience teaching uh is something she enjoys and would really like to do

uh

However breaking into it I think will be really difficult

But as the work pattern will be somewhat similar to her work pattern prior to the accident where a musician has a number of different tasks then part-time teaching I think would be the first step 

The second uh approach I I would make would be

Despite having criticised the local authority for not uh taking on as many disabled people as they should they do over and above the private sector have a more opportunity policy

so that would be my second uh suggestion uh that she should look for uhm employment or apply for jobs with the local authority uhm  within the general clerical sphere 

And indeed there may be areas of work where her people skills she obviously has people skills uhm w would come into their own

However that type of job wouldn't be above a a a scale two on a local authority uhm which would be uh my second

the best she could hope for would be eight thousand two hundred per annum there

What I 'll do is I 'll conclude the witness 's evidence  uh 

I I suppose I could do it at the end of this morning couldn't I

They are not they are not screaming for it 

OK 

Thank you very much 

Yes 

 

Mr Maynard could you assist me with  one or two matters  as to  other persons who 've been mentioned in connection with this matter 

As far as  Wilson is concerned you told  us yesterday that he was not charged and proceedings were not brought against him

That 's correct

Yes

As far as Lodge was concerned were proceedings pursued against him

No 

There were two other things that our friend name Wilson was almost straight away

He was My Lord

Yes 

Was he in custody at any stage  in respect of this or other matters 

When you say or other matters do you mean in connection with this particular uh case or other things any things

My Lord  if the answer had been yes he was I would have then asked why  in connection with this matter

Yes Fair enough

Was he in custody

He was in custody for  the twenty-first to the twenty-second of August

After that was he released

Yes

He He was arrested by the police  I think at the time our trial was going on at Lancaster

So in June or July of nineteen eighty-five

Yes 

Was that in respect of alleged drug smuggling 

Yes it was 

Was that from the North Wales coast

I don't know 

Did it concern the Defiant 

That I don't know

Sorry

I don't know 

It was not a customs matter

It was a police matter in this My Lord 

Archer  Archer has been mentioned  two Archers 

Were you aware of their identity

Yes

Had they been observed with Lodge and Wilson  dealing with the Defiant  in June July nineteen eighty-four

They had been part of the crew that went to Brest

Yes 

Were proceedings brought against them

Yes

They were 

In respect of that trip

I don't know

I don't know the details of that case 

Were they arrested and kept in custody together with Lodge 

At the same time  at the police unit

Yes

Yes

I don't know 

So as far as the Archers are concerned you know there were proceedings and you know they were held in custody but you don't know what it was about 

I think it was it was the same thing as Lodge whi which was a conspiracy to

I think initially they were arrested for conspiracy to supply drugs

Yes

I think eventually they were charged with a conspiracy to import 

But that was a police matter

I had no dealings with it

Thank you 

As far as Watson was concerned  you had his  interviews when the decision to seize the vessel was taken on the twenty-second of August

Yes I did 

Could I ask you to look at certain passages of his interviews

My Lord  the first passage is at page two twenty-nine

Thank you very much indeed

These two uh These two statements are in fact in the correct order in the file 

Uh when you start

Yes

I 've got that page

Page five of his interview 

Yes My Lord

Have you got two twenty-nine Mr Maynard 

Now in the long answer that he gave half way down that page  he said  towards the end of that answer when my father found out about this lot he gave me a good hiding 



Is that right

Yes

I have

Yes 

He was saying to you to summarize without going through each and every part of this interview  that he had agreed  together with his father to provide finance for Walling 's visit to Africa 

He had said that

Yes 

They had formed a company

Can I Can I just correct something  there 

The original finance had nothing to do with his father 

I think there are two stages of finance here

Certainly

Well let 's just deal with the one that has to to do with Mr Watson himself

That 's the initial stage of finance 

And there was clearly an intention to set up a company  to transport or to import and export machinery 

I think it was to export machinery from the U K to

to export machinery

That had been what he wanted to set up 

It was set up but it never traded

That 's correct 

Would you look please at  page two thirty-three  page nine in the interview My Lord 

Top of that page 

You had asked him did you receive your payment from Walling 

Yes

I received one thousand pounds in cash  but nothing like the fifteen thousand pounds I was promised 

And you said in lieu of the money did Walling give you the drugs to sell

Yes

But I had to hand over the money to Bardell 

It 's plain there that Mr Watson had been promised a substantial amount of cash  fifteen thousand pounds but had been paid nothing like that 

Yes

As part of the drug smuggling 

I accept that he was telling you that it was clearly to do with drugs

But he was also making it clear to you that  he had been promised a lot of money and received very little

That 's correct

 say that he has been paid not in cash but kind

Yes

He was given drugs in lieu

Yes

Now as far as Watson was concerned when he appeared at Lancaster and pleaded guilty  was he already in prison serving a sentence of imprisonment

I believe he was at that stage

Was that for  handling stolen goods

Yes

It was 

Vehicles I believe 

Do you recall  what the length of that sentence was

No

I don't 

Was it in the nature of a conspiracy to handle stolen goods to your recollection

I can't help you with that I 'm afraid

But it certainly involved motor cars

Yes

It did

I I 'm pretty sure of that 

Did he plead guilty  to being a party to the conspiracy charge in the indictment  that is the conspiracy to import drugs on the Defiant 

Or did he plead guilty  uh to  conspiracy to supply cannabis

I I think there was only ever one charge against him which was conspiracy to import 

I think My Lord I wonder if I may assist there

I think we did have  a document 

However many charges there were did he plead guilty to conspiracy to import 

My Lord it was in fact conspiracy to evade a prohibition

It was count one  of the indictment

That is correct

And he received a sentence of eighteen months

That was an imort importation charge

Yes

Thank you very much 

And then he was sentenced to eighteen months ' imprisonment suspended for two years

That is correct

That sentence being passed in November nineteen eighty-five

Yes

That 's what I 've got in front of this bundle isn't it

Yes

It is

Yes 

As far as Payne is concerned  I don't think you have any details available to you of his previous convictions

It was very very minor from memory 

That 's your recollection of it

Yes 

What

Very bad

Very minor

Very 

Very minor I beg your pardon I must 've misheard you

Very minor 

Mr Payne in the interviews  has made a full confession as to his part in a conspiracy to import drugs on the Defiant

Yes

He has

At the trial he pleaded not guilty

He did 

Which clearly was a plea that was inconsistent with the admissions that were in that interview

That goes without saying

Yes 

Did he give evidence 

No

He didn't

No

I think Mr Maynard to assist His Lordship the trial was aborted  after a as I recall three defendants had given evidence 

I think that 's probably right

Not including Payne

Payne was well down the indictment

Thank you

Yes

He was 

Can you recall whether there was a trial within a trial  in Payne 's case

For Pay for Payne

For Payne

There wasn't 

Were the police officers attacked or w w was w were you attacked in cross-examination

Did you interview Payne

I can't remember

No

I didn't

Was the officer who interviewed Payne attacked in cross-examination on the grounds that the interview was all  uh

He wasn't

He wasn't 

I think to I think to be fair  certainly my recollection was that it was accepted that the words had been said

one-mumbled-utterance 

That 's your recollection too is it

Yes My Lord

Thank you very much

Mr Maynard  summarizing the evidence you gave yesterday it was to this effect  that you and other customs officers knew of Wilson 's involvement with that vessel between  March nineteen eighty-four and August nineteen eighty-four

Yes 

That involvement extended to carrying out substantial works on the vessel

Yes 

That was one of the factors you took into consideration in deciding he was the owner of the vessel

What gives at the start

Please don't think I 'm commenting adversely

But what gives the date as March

His admission in interview

That 's when he started having 

Yes

Thank you very much indeed 

Now the voyage was in the summer wasn't it to Brest 

The voyage to Brest was in July

 

Along the river

Maybe it 's uh a l l l local voyage

Along the river

And in his interview he also mentions going to the Scillies

Yes

To the Scilly Isles

Inshore waters

No

That 's that 's the same voyage as Brest

Thank you

Midshore waters in other words

Yes My Lord 

The customs officers had been observing  the movements of the vessel  for weeks before  the seizure in August 

In fact

Let me put it this way 

Initially observations on that vessel in in March and April were by police in South Wales 

Were the customs aware of those observations

It was cu g Yes it was done in conjunction with Operation Ocean Man

So there was cooperation and communication between the police and customs officers as to observations 

Yes

Police and customs

Uhm during the latter part of July  whilst we were waiting for  the  Lady Harriet to return to U K shores  police and customs kept the Defiant under observations 

And the Lady Harriet we know was away from May until the end of July nineteen eighty-four 

Yes 

These observations

I am only talking about the week or ten days as we were waiting for  the  Lady Harriet to return

It 's not continuous

No no 

But during the period March to August nineteen eighty-four  customs officers were aware of Wilson and Lodge and Archer and their involvement with that vessel 

Not Archer

No

I We didn't know who Archer was

Wilson I 'm not certain

Wilson 

Now  you were satisfied as at the twenty-second of August nineteen eighty-four  that Wilson was the owner

Yes

And you served notice on him 

Correct 

As case officer for the preparation of the criminal trial you would have worked in conjunction with counsel representing the crown

Yes indeed 

Why was it then Mr Maynard that the criminal case at Lancaster in June nineteen eighty-five was presented to the jury on the basis that after the Defiant returned to Milford Haven in February nineteen eighty-four it appeared to have been largely abandoned 

This was explained by Mr Kaye at the trial

My Lord

I want to hear what the witness says please

Yes

Please go on

It was explained by Mr Kaye who was  prosecution Q C at the trial what had happened in this case  in that I had briefed  the original customs solicitor Miss Hands 

Unfortunately she handed the case over to Miss Jenkins 

Miss Jenkins wrote the brief to Mr Kaye 

Miss Jenkins did not mention the details of the Defiant 

At the opening for the case I was not in court

I was in another court case in Edinburgh 

So I didn't hear the opening 

Yes

Is that the explanation 

You have seen the case summary  a document prepared by crown counsel for the assistance of all at the trial

Yes I believe I did

In that case summary it is made plain and you could see a copy if you wish  at paragraph fifty-four that what crown counsel were saying was that the Defiant appeared to have been largely abandoned

She was still there in August when found by customs officers with her name changed to The Wild Duck

You will have seen that in the summary

I 'm sure I did see it

Now if you saw that in the summary whether or not you were there at the opening why didn't you correct the position with counsel who were engaged to prosecute

Because although I read something I did not pick that point up

Pure and simple

But it was an important point wasn't it Mr Maynard

Clearly it was an important point

It is crucial because your case or one strand of the customs ' case was that the vessel had come back in February nineteen eighty-four with Wallings Payne and others on board 

It had been largely abandoned and stayed there at Milford Haven until Mr Neil went on board on the twenty-fifth of August nineteen eighty-four and found traces of cannabis

So  Mr Lehrer if I can take you back please to page one  of the the uh agreement 

The uh meeting which you had on the second of July nineteen eighty-six which was referred to as the meeting talked about with Mr Lampitt

Uh 

At that uh meeting he was uh he told you that his premises were in Hammersmith 

I think or you knew that his premises were in Hammersmith 

Yes

Uh and then as you told us his uh  h he he was interested in uh a business which was within a twenty-five mile radius of Hammersmith

Ish yes 

Well you didn't say ish earlier

you said twenty-five twenty-five mile radius

Yes sir

Uh and uh  that  uh his interest uh was to reduce costs effectively by bringing in whatever business there was within the twenty-five mile radius into Hammersmith 

Yes 

And uh  as the resource of  as a result of that of course we know that you sent out uh this agreement 

Uh d think you accept do you not that  your entitlement to commission only arose  or only arises if an introduction which you made proceeded to the transaction  proceeded to the purchase

Yes 

And what Mr Lampitt told you was that he was interested in acquiring a business  whereby he could bring that business  into the centre of London in effect

Mm 

There was no discussion uh and you don't tell us about any discussion which you had whereby he said that he was interested in acquiring just a percentage of a business

Uh his interest was to bring the whole thing lock stock and barrel into Hammersmith wasn't it 

Yeah

Uh uh possibly

Yes

Yes 

Your  page three of the bundle  uh  was not a precise date 

I think a pound sign on a typewriter or a word processor 's generally  uh a shift three or a shift four key do you know that

I certainly have to

But it looked as though it indicated looked as if  uh  at this note of C four O six was sent out very shortly after the meeting you had with Mr Lampitt 

I don't know

I don't know

Well it was sent out in July nineteen eighty-six

We know you had the meeting in July nineteen eighty-two

That 's very plainly introducing a company which had its premises in Dorset and was not in accordance with the requirements of Mr Lampitt

Uhm uhm

Uhm 

Mr Stuart wanted to see it 

Did you deliver a note to the address of Mr Lampitt 

Yes

But uh uh I already had spoken to Mr Stuart I think

I don't know the date of this letter

I see

But why is it that there 's no reference to the letter of Mr Stuart 

I don't know

But I I started sending them usually to them uh uh as it came in 

This is a particular company uh

this is not just a janitorial

This a chemical company uh a well-known chemical company Atom uhm well-respected and it is a worthwhile thing to look at uhm

Uh I mean I see but  I thought your evidence earlier was that Mr Lampitt 's requirement was for a company which was in the purely janitorial field

Yes 

There we see at page four C four one O  and that we know as Ferndale 

Yes

And it very much looks as if that document was sent in or about July nineteen eighty-six as well

Uh how where does that come from 

My Lord it doesn't come from anything in writing  uh I

I 'm putting that

I 'm simply putting that to the witness 





 it 's the very first point My Lord 

Uhm well can I put it can I put it more clearly to you Mr Lehrer

You are you unable to tell us whether that was sent in July or not

I can't say

You can't say 

Uh then uh then what we do see at page five  is a letter dated the twenty-fourth of July nineteen eighty-six again addressed to Mr Lampitt on this occasion and no reference to Mr Stuart



Yes 

Uh and uh we have I think you probably accept that C four O two and C four hundred uh are not within a twenty-five mile radius of London  but uh

Oh uh yes they are uh

Carlton Cleaning certainly are

Carlton Cleaning

Can you tell us where   its premises

Uhm

Actually Carlton Cleaning his premises were in Essex his office-cleaning division which I sold that to Rentokil but his actual janitorial house operated in the London area 

He had a janitorial house in the London area Carlton 

He operated uh a great deal of uh deliveries and hi his business was in the London area

Thank you 

 can you help us with the pre precise address of that

No I can't

I haven't

  certainly more than twenty-five miles from uh Hammersmith 

But but it 's deliveries not  premises deliveries

Uhm I think that uh deliveries are important not particularly where exactly the premises are

Well I thought you agreed Mr uh  Lehrer that what was required was a business within that sort of radius uh that could be moved lock stock and barrel into London 

The de the delivery uh pattern of lorries is very very important

It 's more important actually than the geographical position of the warehouse 

Uhm uh

OK I don't think that 's ever referred to in any of these documents or in any of I don't think that 's ever before been referred to or in any of the conversations  between you and Mr Stuart or you and Mr Lampitt

Oh Mr Stuart was very pleased to look at these

He thought they were uh what he wanted to see

Well they 're addressed to Mr Lampitt though aren't they

Yes but we hadn't uh we hadn't yet on the computer put Mr Stuart 's name on it

That 's all

I see 

The the next  next what occurs I think is that if we look at the diary entry  uh at page seventy-two  there is the  reference in your diary at that point on the ninth of September nineteen eighty-two ninety nineteen eighty-six  uh to a telephone conversation with Ferndale Business Services

Uhm

Yes 

I think according to your evidence Ferndale Business Services got in touch with you having seen  an advertisement in one of the papers

Well Ferndale I wrote to 

Ferndale you wrote to 

Do you have a uh  do you have a copy of that letter

No I uhm  I direct-mailed them

I don't keep copies of all my direct mail I I have them on uh computer and I direct-mailed them

Uh but they responded to uh one of my letters 

Was it not the case that they responded to an advertisement that you placed in the trade press 

I have an a I have a a permanent advertisement in uh all of the uhm cleaning magazines which explains to people that I specialise in uhm selling companies in the janitorial and the cleaning industry

It is possible that they may have seen my advertisement as well

Yes 

At all events Mr Hook uh telephoned and as you say there was a meeting set up for the eighteenth of September  nineteen eighty-seven

Yes

Yes that 's right 

Which you had 

The uh 

At that point  Mr Hook  on behalf of Ferndale had indicated to you that he was interested in further expansion of his business  had he not

Well Hook said one thing and uh th th the other guy said something else

They both were at almost at conflict with each other

Well let me concentrate on what Mr Hook said

Yes

Uh didn't Mr Hook say to you that at this point that he was interested in further expansion  of the uh Ferndale business did he not

Yes 

By further expansion he meant  the acquisition of  other companies

No 

He didn't mean acquisition of other companies 

But he meant enlarging his business 

Well most people say they want to enlarge their business when they talk to me

But really uh they 're wanting to sell their businesses

They th they they come with the thing that they are going to go national but how much could you get for this business in any case

Uhm Mr Hook certainly wasn't in any uh mind to me uh uhm a buyer 

If he had been a buyer I would have sent him a contract for buying

Uh well he said he didn't come to you as a seller did he

Yes he did

He came to you

Well  he came to you seeking to expand if you agree with me

Seeking to

He

That was his guise

He wanted uh he wanted to expand

But in actual fact he was interested in anything that would allow him uh to uh to expand

I mean one of the things would be to buy and then go and work for someone  or merge with someone that was uh bigger and had the uh financial ability to to to move him forward

Uh let me go over this to when you were taking this slightly doubted sequence chronologically but later in your evidence which you were giving earlier in chief  you refer to a discussion you had with Mr Stuart  when you agreed or apparently Mr Stuart agreed that Ferndale had been overexpanding in your words 

Was it was it not the case that uh as at  September nineteen eighty-six when you saw Mr when you saw Mr Hook  uh that he was and Ferndale was in the process of expansion and that was their interest

It was not he was not interested in selling the business

Uhm

Uhm

They were interested in selling the business it was very clear

If they were interested in expanding why would they have taken me to a hall somewhere uh uh into a quiet table uh and sat there

If they were interested in expanding I would 've thought uh they would 've put me in the office there and let everyone see that they had Michael Lehrer there and they were buying businesses 

Uhm Hook was selling 

Did you 

Did you  obtain 

Uh you take notes at that you took notes at that stage bu but you don't have those notes now

No I don't have them no

When did you when did you get rid of those notes 

Oh long long time ago uhm

Long long time ago

It 's very clear  when you 're sitting with uh  sellers uh what they 're talking about you don't have to take a lot of notes on on o o on what they are talking

You know what the man 's saying

He 's telling me his turnover

He 's telling me he 's expanding and he 's he 's called me to sell he hasn't called me to buy 

Well he 's certainly not called you to buy uh to sell his business lock stock and barrel has he

Yes

He certainly wasn't intending to do that

Most of the people who talk to me don't admit to the truth which is that they are really selling

They talk about expansion but they 're really talking about selling

I don't mean everyone but a lot of people first time who don't know whether to buy or sell advise me

And uh I said well uh uh in his case he didn't ask such a thing

He merely was talking about his particular problem financial problems

Mr Lehrer are you I want to be clear about this are you telling us that this is your interpretation of what he was telling you or what he was actually telling you

That is what he was telling me uh

He was telling you that he wanted to sell his business lock stock and barrel 

Uhm yes that he would like to go in with someone else and and carry on working and things 

Well that 's just not right is it

He was and I think you would agree with me at the outset looking at expanding his business  at that time not selling it

I didn't hear it that way

I am sorry 

Is it possible that you interpreted what he told you in much the same way that you interpreted the request from Mr Lampitt  by sending him information about  chemical companies in Dorset and other companies in West Sussex and you were just hearing from Mr Hook what you wanted to hear uh and leading him in the way that you assumed  that he was selling to you rather than in fact what he was saying to you

No 

I say to you that I don't send uh  special businesses to people without me requesting them 

I send out a sheet of paper every month with the businesses that are for janitorial sale at the moment the latest list and they ask for them and I send them

I don't do it because uh if if if Stuart 's people ask me for something I send it

Why did you think they might have the slightest uh need for an injection of a large sum of money

To expand their business

They might be in financial difficulties 

Why does anybody need an injection of cash

And if I had a lot of money injected into my business I would expand my business

Doesn't mean I 'm in financial difficulties  hopefully not anyway

 the idea is to 

doesn't necessarily mean it 's in financial difficulties

No no My My Lord

I I I accept that I went too far with the with the question in suggesting rather more than intended

Uh  but uh wa wasn't your attitude that uh uh that if you waited you uh you may as well be able to do business somewhat later

No not at all

There was no intimation of that whatsoever 

Now uh  another another matter

You in your evidence you seem to talk of taking over one business and perhaps only one

I I I I suggest that uh if y you were quite prepared to to uh be interested in any other business if if they uh added up to whatever you you wanted as a whole to add on to your business

Is that right 

Initially we were looking for one business with a turnover of a million pounds

We were not looking for two or three businesses over a million pounds at that point

Well two of the

Mr Mr Dearer put it graphically

He said half plus half equals one

So if two businesses with half a million pounds turnover was were available that would be the same as or similar to a business one business of one million pounds turnover

It would only be similar





If you 've ever tried running a business it 's very difficult particularly

I don't know if you ever tried running a business but it 's very difficult

Two businesses to run is a lot harder than one I tell you 



Did you  these two businesses which are are merged

and that is in fact what you you went through with me

Yes indeed 

Now uhm  in nineteen eighty-seven you said there were no negotiations with Mr Hook 

And none with Mr Hunt either 

Did you see either of those two gentlemen on any occasion in nineteen eighty-seven

I think I said earlier that I

When was that that meeting

No not to my recollection

But certainly not in the context of which we are talking

Well I 'm not not interested in the context of that

I am asking whether you uh saw either of those two gentlemen

The answer therefore is no

You said earlier not as far as you remember

Could you have seen one of those gentlemen in nineteen eighty-seven

I might have seen Mr Hook across a crowded room somewhere but that was it literally

Not to speak to

Did you attend meetings together

No

As I 've said earlier this the reason he appeared at that meeting was because he was in fact he 'd worked for the company who had now made him a distributor

We had been a distributor for fifty years for them and he appeared on his first occasion at the meeting 

I wasn't aware that he was a distributor of any size with any other business with which I was attending the meeting 

Well for instance did you uh attend any uh janitorial industry meetings  together

No 

You are quite certain of that are you

Yes

As a  as a comment about the janitorial industry I was not interested a at that point in time of attending anything that was los loosely described as an industry meeting other than with my suppliers 

Yes

And uh when you met Mr Hook that would apply to Mr Hunt as well would it

Didn't see Mr Hunt at all

I never met Mr Hunt in fact until about April nineteen eighty-eight 

So uh re regarding that meeting in uh at the end of nineteen eighty-seven the contractors ' uh uh meeting uhm you spoke to Mr to Mr Hoo Hook did you

Yes I did

As I spoke to nearly everybody there

It was literally an open meeting

We were all in a room

Did Mr uh did you or Mr Hook make any reference whatever to the uh the  the uh the the the the matter of uh the negotiations in in nineteen eighty-six

I would think that is most unlikely

It was pro

Do you think quite

What did you say

No it was most unlikely I said

It was common knowledge in our industry

Our industry is not a very large industry

It is a very uh insular industry and everybody knows everybody

I 've been in it twenty-nine years

And I think it 's fair to say I know the managing directors of the fifty biggest companies in England

And it was well known at that time because we advertised it if that 's the right term to the to the uh people at large that we were looking to acquire businesses

So many people said are you still searching for a business to acquire 

Mr Hook could well have been one of those people

So Mr Hook might 've said at this meeting for instance are you still uh wanting to acquire businesses

He might well have done but so might  twenty-five other people



How on earth is this going to help me

They meet at the meeting 

he suddenly says

yes

and then he rings up two months later

alternatively he rings up two months later out of the blue

 terribly short point that one

My Lord I I I hope uh 

It 's it 's just that uh th this evidence has been uh adduced uh

No the evidence was indi adduced

And now you say well what really can you remember what happened at this meeting and he 's doing his level best to be polite and search as best he can something which happened three and a half years ago

My question to you is how on earth is it going to help me in what I very shortly have got to decide

Well of course My Lord it 's on the periphery of the material

This is why litigation goes on so long

Long opening speeches very detailed cross-examination about irrelevant detail and a huge bill for the loser 

I do that

I 'm I 'm delaying a bit because I was hoping that this witness 'd be out of the witness box before lunchtime

But uhm how much more have you got to ask him 

I don't want to rush you but I am terribly keen that uhm we concentrate on what is material to a very short matter issue I have to decide 

My Lord not very long

Very well 

So uh  in January you you 're telephoned

January nineteen eighty-eight you 're you 're telephoned you say in your office

That 's right

And uh how d' you uh 

Uh Mr Hook said that uh  that uh  there may may be a way forward

Now d' you discuss the

what was the manner of the way forward at that stage

No not at all

He described to me in general detail his business e g where he operated from how many people he had and who the directors were

Yeah but you knew all that already didn't you

No I didn't at that time because it was twelve thirteen fourteen months later

It could 've all changed

I didn't know his turnover because the accounts I had were originally nineteen eighty-five were now up to nineteen eighty-eight 

And uhm so you wanted to see some accounts then

 first thing you need to do is give us an up to date set of accounts

And he hadn't so he had to wait a bit because the end of year accounts hadn't yet been ready 

Well  the thirty-first of December  seventh of January

and he was obviously not 



Approximately I think two months later by his accountants

And uh they were the accounts for nineteen uh eighty-seven ending eighty-seven

It 's page twenty-two twenty-three  

And you were satisfied with those weren't you because you already had the earlier accounts didn't you

I wasn't satisfied with those accounts any more than I was with the first accounts personally

Well

No but I mean uh you you

In order to

If you were going to take over a company you would want to see how it had fared over a number of years wouldn't you

We asked for three years ' accounts

I believe that that is what in fact we eventually got

Well did you

Look at page twenty-two and twenty-three

Do those uh refer  to the accounts for the year ending thirty-first of December eighty-seven

Yes they do

Well it 's just that that 's not three years

No I said eventually I said we got for three years

Eventually

But you already had the eighty-six accounts hadn't you

Last year we what we had was eighty-five 's accounts

Well it it it

All right uhm

I hadn't had eighty-six 's because I hadn't had correspondence with the gentleman

I I see what you mean

It 's page uhm seventy-seven

one which is accounts for the  thirty-first of March eighty-six and uh ninety-one

the other one which admittedly is is the end of eighty-five

Uhm uhm

That 's what I meant to say

But those are the accounts we got eventually for three years backwards

Yeah but you you 'd already had seventy-seven and ninety in uh your first batch of negotiations you 

How would I have had eighty-six 's accounts in nineteen eighty-six

How could I have had nineteen eighty-six 's accounts in nineteen eighty-six

I am unclear on that 

If you look at page seventy-seven 

Yes

K.C.F. name 's accounts for the year ending thirty-first of March eighty-six

That is one subsidiary

Yes I know that and page ninety is is nineteen eighty-five accounts or ninety-one

That 's for the group

Because of the differences in their e accounting years  we had not had at that point any accounts for the Ferndale Group nineteen eighty-six

E exactly

but did

you did have  up to March eighty-six

Yes that one little item within the bu the business though

So you didn't need to ask for them again did you

I don't know if you 've ever done been involved in acquisitions but

and you deal with people like Touche Ross

they want every account that ev that anybody 's ever had for three years back

I didn't make this decision

The account that Touche Ross following their request for more  more information was we must have three years ' accounts before we can even discuss the matter with you to advise you

So we had to pursue it to get three years ' accounts

I d

When the the previous negotiations floundered I 'm not at all sure that I would have kept or anybody would 've kept nineteen eighty-five 's accounts

It was a dead duck and so we would have passed on to the next bit 

So you 're not sure whether you you uh you had them or not

I was saying we were the last

Touche Ross would 've asked us to obtain three years ' accounts so they would consider them

Whether I got them in nineteen eighty-six or nineteen eighty-seven m would not 've made any difference to Touche Ross



For the moment I 'm not asking what Touche Ross were interested in

You you arranged without Touche Ross 's involvement is this not right for uh the accounts for nineteen eighty-seven to be sent which were duly sent uhm

No it was with Touche Ross 's involvement

Well w was it in fact three three in the afternoon

Uhm most probably

If I wrote this uhm a week later I would 've remembered the time better than I do now definitely

It most probably was about three 

And uh  you say that you you didn't see what did the damage 

No that 's what I was told

B I came back

People who saw the steps taken out had told me what they saw of the steps and what they saw sticking out

I see

That 's their description not mine

I should have most probably made that clearer at the time 

At any rate di did you uhm g go down to another step or did you in fact uhm  go to the bottom do you say

Uhm  my feet touched what I presume was either a step down or the bottom

I 'm not being 

I can't remember exactly now but

But you only had one hand because you 'd got a cigarette in the other

No I was holding on with both hands but the cigarette was in my two fingers

I mean  I don't think that made a difference 

Now y you you told My Lord that uh at first you didn't realise you 'd cut yourself at all

No I didn't 

And the only reason you were getting out of the pool was in fact to go and get a replacement cigarette

Yeah that 's right 

And after you 'd got out of the pool it looked I think you described like a cat scratch 

Uhm yes that 's right 

And it was only  then that it i it uh the the the wound opened

Uhm as soon as I took my leg out of the water it fell straight open 

When you got out on that occasion did you use the steps or did you hump yourself up onto the side

Uhm

no

I put my leg onto the top shelf    pull myself out on the steps



Yes

So you did use the steps to get out of it

Yes I did

I hadn't understood that before

Perhaps I uhm didn't pick it up 

But uh you weren't at that stage uh  worried about anything except the fact that you needed another cigarette

Because I didn't feel any pain at all and I didn't even realise as I said that my leg had been injured 

So you weren't looking for any broken pieces or anything at that stage

You were more interested in uh  getting back to your packet

Well yeah I was just getting back out 

I mean I didn't realise I 'd hurt myself 

Yes

I realised I 'd fallen

I just got back out

I didn't

But

So you weren't in fact that stage uhm  concerned to see whether or not the the step had broken as you tr trod on it or whether it had was lying at the bottom or not

I didn't tread on anything

I put my first leg on the top shelf or the second shelf whatever you want to call it of the stair

As I went to step on the next shelf it was not there

and I fell really hard as if I fell down a step in the dark and missed it 

No I think you missed the strongest point

You Because you didn't know you 'd been injured  you didn't uh look round and say

whatever 's happened to that step 

is it lying at the bottom of the pool

Yes

No I didn't look round

No I didn't

I didn't stand down on anything either  to break anything

so I when I got back out again it looked as though it had broken 

But I didn't touch anything to break anything 

No

And y you you couldn't  remember  now whether or not you other people had used the steps in the  hours that you 'd been 

No they didn't

everybody was just jumping in

Nobody bothered with climbing in

It didn't look too good

Did you quite a lot of people use steps to get out don't they

Uhm yes

But I can't remember whether they did or not that morning

I don't think so

Everybody was just in I think the quick way

The welcome party was

I think it was about half past ten

Is that right

Uhm

uh

I can't remember now

but if that 's what time it was I w I attended it 

And uh  how long did that go on for

Because they were giving away free wine it probably went on for a reasonable length of time 

At least half an hour

Anyway at least half an hour

Suggest it ma may have been a bit longer than that

Most probably but I

At least half an hour

But at any rate you 'd been uh  by the pool if it was three o'clock for for several hours

Yes

And uh  was the pool pretty busy

Very busy 

You saw the pool being cleaned when you arrived

Yes

Was that done on a dai uh uh a daily basis so far as you were aware

Uhm I don't know because after that I never was up early in the morning to see it 

Have you uh  taken any advice about uh  protecting your leg it would be the scars with against sunburn  using a stronger

Just to wear sun block but it doesn't really work

It 's the actual heat that affects it

If I get very very hot and the sun 's directly on it

It does It 's more sensitive than my ordinary skin and ordinary skin would get too hot and burn 

I have to cover it in the shade 

And uh the  the the rep Gail who came with you to the ambulance it would 've been the ambulance I think was was helping to try and control the bleeding and the scar wasn't it

The deep cut at that stage

Uhm she was just holding my hand 

And by the time you got back uhm  the hotel had already r removed the steps

Yeah 

The notice in relation to the person you say was Darren refers to either he or she

Couldn't wa Was there some doubt in your mind as to whether it was a lady or gentleman you 'd spoken to or who spoke to you

No I think it was a gentleman

And uh when were you aware of his name

Uhm when I asked him for his address before I left the holiday 

And it was that particular person that uh you understood to be saying w w w the uh the step had been missing for a week

He was with about ten friends and they all said the same thing except they all gave me their names

Uh he gave me his name and address to be the lead of the group if I needed them for future reference

But uhm we couldn't trace him

But they all said the same 

Yes I 've no further questions 

Uhm may I have your full name please Miss White

Uh Lorraine Jacqueline White

Can you keep your voice up again please

Lorraine Jacqueline White

I 'm afraid it does involve a bit of uh shouting

What is your address

Sixteen Shields Road Whitney Bay Tyne-and-Wear 

And were you in the  Club Eighteen-Thirty party that went to the hotel Sanfora

Not at the same time as Miss Hoffmann

I was already there 

How long had you been there before the day of her accident

Uhm just the night before

Well I uh got there the early hours of the morning 

So you ar So you arrived the day before did you

Well she uhm Heidi got there at seven

I 'd got there uhm  two two o'clock in the morning 

All right

I see

You 'd come at two o'clock in the morning

she came at seven o'clock in the morning 

Yes

And uh  uh on the morning of uh the accident uh were you by the swimming pool

Yes

The afternoon of the accident you were you about the swimming pool

Yeah 



Had you been to the welcome party

Yeah 

Did you see anybody doing anything to the swimming pool that morning

Just the cleaners in the morning uhm  taking any leaves that shrank off the uhm top of the pool 

What time of the day was that

About seven o'clock 

And at what time of the day would were uh the holiday-makers allowed to use the swimming pool

From nine o'clock 

And what time of day d did you go to the swimming pool 

Yes I went down

What 's what time roughly

Oh we went for the welcome meeting first

Uhm  that was about ten o'clock half past

And then round the pool after that 

And when you arrived at the swimming pool were there other people there

A few but not many 

And uhm were you present at the time when Miss Hoffmann had her accident

Yes 

What did you see of that

We were all round by the side of the pool

Uhm  I saw Heidi get out  go and get a drink and I saw her climb in miss the step and then it was just  lot of commotion after that getting her out 

Did you uhm uh have a look at her when she came out of the pool

Yeah

Did you see the cut

Yeah 

And uh  did you have a look inside the pool yourself

Yes we all had a look round

Uh there was nothing there 

There was nothing there around the area of the the steps

No

nothing in the pool or  round about  on the outside 

At some stage the steps uh were removed

Did you see that happen

That was later on in the afternoon 

Uh roughly what time was that 

About how long after the accident 

Half an hour or an hour maybe 

And could you see what it was that had c could 've caused the accident to Miss Hoffmann

Not really uhm

I just take it that it was a piece of metal sticking out  from the side where the step had  not been broken off 

Did you actually see the step being removed

Did you see somebody carting it away

No

I saw somebody uhm a workman there

I didn't actually see him take it away 

Uh

is that something you saw this piece of jagged metal or something you assumed must be there

I assumed that it must 've been there to have caused the uhm  the accident 

OK OK

And did you see what happened to those steps

No 

And uh  were you involved in taking uh Miss Hoffmann to the the medical centre or not

No I was going to but I 'd given Heidi my T-shirt and I wasn't allowed on the ambulance with without a top so uhm  Gail went with her 

Did you keep her company at all for the rest of the holiday

While we were there

But I had booked up for the whole trips this whole two weeks so I we were away from the hotel quite a lot 

So just so that I have it clear in my own mind after the accident had happened you had a look to see if there was anything down below

When you looked at that time you said there was nothing there

Did you look at the set of steps themselves

Just noticed that there was a step missing but I didn't actually examine the steps 

Yes thank you Miss White

That 's all I wanted to ask

The uh  Club Eighteen-Thirty holidays as as one can tell from the brochure are holidays specifically designed for young people young single people

That 's right 

And they 're sold to them on the basis that they 're going to have uhm a good time

Yes

And it 's expected uhm that from time to time uh they may uh themselves have slightly more to drink than is wise 

I mean that happens doesn't it

I 'm sure it does with all holiday-makers 

Yes

But when you 've got a large group of single people uh in a hotel like this round the swimming pool  with drinks available people do sometimes uh drink more than they should

Yes

They do but it 's not something we encourage 

And the result of that is that from time to time people may not be quite as responsible and careful as they would be on other occasions

Yes 

Now I I I 'm concerned in this case to a ascertain from you what  precautions you take as the head representative for the safety of those who come on the holidays

Do you understand

Yes

Uhm

Uh fi

first of all uh  do you as the head representative uh accept your own uh obligations so far as your own duties are concerned for looking out for the safety of uhm the guests 

It 's obviously something uhm

If we we actually lived in a hotel

us three representatives lived there as they do in most Eighteen-Thirty properties

and they 're there on the spot

and obviously if there was something like a chipped tile in the pool or dangerous steps or whatever then we would repair that and fix it

So in that way we do look after people 's safety if it 's brought to our attention 

As a a Club Eighteen-Thirty representative do you have any training

Do you go on a course  to tell you what your duties ought to be and what you should look out for and

Yes

We do 

Yes

And uh does that involve any training with regard to safety measures that might be appropriate at hotels

They do obviously on the training course point out or make suggestions to us things to look out for while we 're in the hotels

And the company encourages you when you 're at on duty to have a look round or a walk round 

Is it part of your responsibility or someone else 's responsibility to check whether the people who 're running the hotel appear on the face of it to be competent and up to the job

That would probably be the responsibility of the area manager in a particular resort 

And who was that at this time

It was a gentleman called Steve Cutbush 

And just to have some idea of uh how it works what sort of age would the area manager be

Is he uh an a young person or  uh someone like me elderly

D probably around early thirties probably 

But you have no personal knowledge of what steps Mr Cutbush may have taken uh to check this particular hotel out

I don't I 'm afraid 

With regard to  the basic safety of you know fire escapes and the electrics and things like that does it fall to you as the head representative to check that out

or to someone else

What normally happens is in the beginning either the area manager or the resort manager would make the initial check

and it 's really up to us to keep maintaining that while we 're there to keep a look out for things and bring them to the attention of the management and the hotel if we come across any problems 

Well now things in a hotel may break from time to time may they not

Yes 

That 's true 

Yes

And uh obviously if they do break as happened here injury may be sustained

You 'd have that in mind would you 

You 'd be aware of that possibility

That there could be a possibility that would happen 

And therefore would you think it important to uh uh have some sort of system to see that uh where there was a risk of danger that something was done before an accident happened 

I think after the initial check 's been made it 's important to keep on and maintain a check on it

But uhm with the nature of Club Eighteen-Thirty what happened is we lived there and we ate there

we didn't leave the hotel apart from accompanying guests on excursions

and we were there all the time to look for things like that as well as part of our everyday job 

Now you say that uh there was somebody who was a maintenance man 

Yes

Wh who who was that

Was he an Englishman or a a a 

No

He was Spanish 

And how old or young was he

He was in his late forties I would say 

He used to come into the hotel uhm quite often and just have a a walk round a wander round 

Did you personally uhm take any steps to see how reliable a sort of man he was 

No

I didn't 

You don't know do you whether the hotel had any system at all for checking the fittings round the swimming pool

I don't I 'm afraid 

It wasn't part of your job to inquire of the hotel whether they had that system 

I think that was probably done at the start of season when the initial check was done

But no I didn't 

And if there was supposed to be some system for the maintenance man to check the swimming pool out you certainly didn't yourself  check to see if he was doing his job did you

No

I didn't 

This is uh a as we 've uh as you 've told His Lordship uh a hotel where there could be up to  uh a hundred and forty  boisterous people on holiday at any one time 

Is that right

Yes 

That 's right 

And over the course of a season  they may or may not one doesn't know but they may uhm use the swimming pool to a substantial degree

Is that right

Yes

Large numbers using it every day

People normally do

Yes 

Pool would be very popular I guess

Yes

Yes

In a hotel of this sort particularly

When it 's absolutely right in front of the hotel like that

That 's right

And is the the sort of regime one where people would go out on uhm excursions during the day and then come back and spend the latter part of the afternoon probably uh around the swimming pool

The excursion programme we operated had three day excursions

And they were like full-day excursions so it wasn't coming back in the afternoon

they were away for most of the day

But the rest were in the evening 

So there 'd be some people there throughout the day and then going out on evening excursions and other people who might be out all day

That 's right

The majority of people actually went out on the excursions 

Now over the course of the season  the steps to the swimming pool might be used a very substantial amount mightn't they

Yes

They could be 

And uh one of the  there may be different hazards than this but one of the hazards where steps are used a lot is that they may gradually work away from the wall

That happens to swimming pool steps doesn't it

I 'm not sure

I 'm not that familiar with them to be honest

You 've never yourself gone around checking the steps

No

I 've checked them when I was in the pool obviously which was almost every day and coming out  and uhm the the steps were OK

If there 'd been any problem with them then I would 've noticed 

Well

I appreciate that 's what you say

but  if anything should be wrong with swimming pool steps   as we 've seen in this case it 's a potential source of injury isn't it

Yes

Yes 

And was that one of the reasons why when you were in the pool you used to check the steps to make sure they were safe

Yes

As well as it was easier for me to come out via the steps 

But you don't know how many days it was since you last went into the pool before Miss Hoffmann 's accident do you

I can't remember exactly

Within two or three days

but I can't sp specify which day 

Now you presumably well

you say that uh when you used the steps that you checked them

Do you check to see whether uh there is the possibility of the steps beginning to break in the way that they must have done here

No

I didn't 

So they 

Y you 've heard the evidence that 's been given  that uh that there was probably  there appears to have been a step missing

Yes

Yes 

And you weren't aware of that until after the accident had happened were you

That 's right 

When the accident uh  happened you were called to the pool side

Miss Hoffmann was still there was she

Yes

She was

And were you made aware that it was uhm a severe injury to her leg which was caused by the steps of the swimming pool

When I was called I was more concerned with Miss Hoffmann rather than what had caused that in the beginning and to make sure that an ambulance was called

Uhm and that was really my main concern at that time

But uh uh Miss Tarburn at the time when you were called to the swimming pool there was one of your guests with a great gash in her leg

Yes 

uh did you not make any enquiry at that time I appreciate that your first concern was for her health

did you not make any enquiry at the time as to how on earth this had happened

Well

when I went out to the pool to Miss Hoffmann 's side another guest another holiday-maker at the time at the pool had come up

and they were filling us in with details but very brief details as to what had happened that she 'd climbed out the pool and that she didn't realise anything was wrong with her leg until someone until the blood started obviously after she 'd come out of the water

Can we look at it this way

When were you first aware that the uh cause of the injury was a s a fall when using the steps to get into the pool

Probably not until I was talking to Miss Hoffmann I would say probably at some point uhm on the journey to the medical centre or at the medical centre

Well

at the time by the swimming pool when you were being filled in with some of the details  did you not appreciate that it was as a result of something sticking out a piece of metal or whatever uh in the in the steps that 'd caused that injury

uhm I knew that someone said it actually happened in the swimming pool but Miss Hoffmann 's leg was obviously in a mess and we were trying to look after her rather than get all the details together 

Because what had happened to her whatever it might 've been might 've happened to another guest

I mean I appreciate you wanted to get her off to hospital but at the same time something had happened to cause a severe injury and that might happen to another guest

Yes

That 's right

Did you leave any instructions with one of your reps to see what had happened and sort it out

That 's something because when I when I went out to the pool there was another representative there

and I thought that he was going to stay and do that

Uhm and I think that 's what happened from there

He went back in and reported it to the section

And that 's how they came out and removed the steps

But who was that

I think it was probably Tony Trafford  who was another representative in the hotel 

Yes

So you did leave some instructions then for something to be done to remove whatever the source of danger was

I didn't give specific instructions

The representative did that automatically 

So not only are the did the steps go missing but the the one rung that was absent uh

you 've heard the evidence this morning that that couldn't be found at the scene either

Yes

I think you were formerly an officer in the Metropolitan Police from nineteen seventy-seven till nineteen ninety

That 's correct sir

I think that uh for nine years you were a traffic control officer

That 's correct sir

Do you have any qualifications in the actual examination of vehicles

Yes I was qualified to examine vehicles  as well as uh reconstruct accidents to uh intermediate or advanced level

And uh I think you attended an accident on Vauxhall Bridge which befell on the twenty-third of October ninety eighty-eight towards uhm six o'clock in the evening

I did sir

Do you have a note of uh your findings at the scene where that happened

I do sir

I made a note at the time and afterwards



Yes you can you can refer to your notes whenever you need to

Thank you Sir

Officer I think that uh you examined that uh Ford Cortina make of car which you found present at the scene of the accident

That 's correct

It was driven by Mr Paul Lipofski

And uh what damage did you find to that vehicle

There was extensive rear damage sir considering that the boot lights bumper both rearside panels suspension rear axle doors

Uh there was s slight damage to the front bumper lights and grille

and there was a

Just just a just a just a point there

Slight damage to the front

Yes to the front bumper lights and grille Sir

Yes

But the main da the main damage which I recorded

It was a total loss

There was a uh a crease in the roof panel by the struts which secured the rear doors sir 

Yes I see

And uh  did you examine uh any other vehicles at the scene

Uhm I may have examined them sir but I did not make a note of them at the time

No

Did you consider uh what uh uhm speed the impact between the Cortina car and whatever had hit its rear had occurred

Uhm

based on my information that the Cortina was stationary uhm because of the extensive damage including the crease to the roof which uh it denotes that the actual uh body shell had been damaged itself rather than just panels

I estimated impact speed of twenty to twenty five to thirty miles an hour 

Yes

In order to make that assessment did you examine any other vehicle

Uh no Sir

Did you examine the scene of the accident to see if there were any signs of the wreckage

Yes there was an amount of debris in the uh lane in which the accident occurred but there was no visible skid marks at the scene uh uh uh

Which lane was the debris found in

Uh the centre lane of three 

Thank you very much officer

Mr Gardiner I think you 're a consultant surgeon in spinal injury at the National Spinal Injury section at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury

Yes

I 've uhm  read those reports

You can take them as evidence in chief if that 's convenient to everybody

My Lord it would be convenient

Mr Gardiner I 'd like to ask you just one or two things  

We have in in this case uh two accidents one upon the other

Uhm the first accident was an accident involving the uhm front of the vehicle

Do I understand you to be saying that in such an accident uh a passenger would be thrown uh first of all forwards and then backwards

Yes his neck would be a hinge

Body would be but his body was restrained so in this instance his head would go forwards on his neck

Yes

And uh I think you can  duty of looking at the informative notes from the uh treating admission treating hospital which would be the Charing Cross Hospital

Well he initially went to the Westminster but then on to the Charing Cross where surgery was performed

And uh the notes show that uh  there was a tear in the posterior longitudinal ligament

Correct 

Am I right in thinking that that is one of the two substantial ligaments which keep the uh discs of the spinal cord in place

Yes

And uh  can you say whether that uh injury would 've occurred whilst somebody was being thrown forward or whilst they were coming backwards

If it occurs in isolation and the anterior ligament is intact then that is a flexion injury namely when the head is going forwards  conversely

Could you just say that again

I 'm so sorry

Yes if the anterior ligament is intact and there 's injury disruption to the posterior ligament  then this is incurred in a flexion injury  when the head is moving forward 

If the anterior ligament is damaged in addition  then it could have occurred in an extension injury with the head moving backwards 

Yes

Yes I see

In this instance the anterior ligament according to the surgeon was intact 

 what 's what 's the other injury

Extension

Extension

Yes

Thank you 

Yes

Now the ligaments having become torn the the uh disc itself is capable of and is not restrained by that ligament and is capable of movement  and uh was being extruded so that it compressed the spinal cord

Correct 

In order for the disc to be extruded what type of force has to be applied to it 

It depends on how complete the rupture is

and it depends on the consistency of the disc 

But the more the force the more likely it would be to be extruded 

And uh that extrusion would it take place on a flexion injury or an extension injury or could it take place uh on either

On either 

Uhm 

After the first accident which has been described  there was a second accident involving the rear of the vehicle on the top of the passengers which was described as a much less violent accident 

Am I correct in thinking that uh that would firstly cause uh Mr Tull 's neck to go backwards and then to go forwards

In other words the movement of the opposite  in the opposite order than they would 've been in the first accident

That is correct assuming his face was pointing forwards 

Assuming his face was pointing forwards

If he had fallen to one side and his neck was twisted then it could move sideways rather than back

Yes  I understand

But he said  said that he had started to go over

Did you hear his evidence

I did yes

And it was with that in mind that I say that e the exact direction

In the normal course if you your head is pointing forwards in the car and you 're hit from behind then your head will extend backwards and then go forwards 

But of course if your head isn't pointing forward that would not be 

Yes I see

Yes I understand

But could you help me with this Mr 

If the person being thrown about sustained spinal injuries  could the  spinal chord 

Yes

So that any movement in any of the four directions uh could 've caused the disc to be extruded into the spinal cord

Yes 

Is any of those more likely than uh any other type to have caused the extrusion 

Well it depends on the magnitude of the force that would have applied at that time 

A greater force is more likely to cause the disc to be squeezed out than a  a small force  and therefore from what I 've heard more likely with the first episode than with the second 

All I can

You you do turn completely away from me

It doesn't make it very easy 

Yes try and  audience

Most likely that what

I 'm sorry

I think it depe the uh the disc could have extruded either during flexion or extension or a lateral movement provided the disc was brought under some pressure

The amount of pressure that the disc is brought under will depend on the amount of force of the movement causing the pressure 

And uh the first impact was of greater magnitude than the second 

and therefore it is likely that the force exerted on the disc was greater  during that time and more likely that it extruded at that time rather than subsequently

During flexion

Cor during the flexion extension of the first accident

Yes

I understand

Yes

Because you will have an extension uh following the flexion

When the ligament was torn his neck would then extend his head would extend back on the neck and then the disc would also be brought under pressure at that point

I see

Yes

Thank you

Mr Gardiner thank you 

What what you 're saying really is that uh the uh amount of force applied in respect of the two accidents is the only thing which uh enables us to form a view as to which accident actually caused the disc extrusion 

I think with the evidence to hand this is the only thing I could go on yes 

Thank you Mr Gardiner

Mr Gardiner  it is very unusual isn't it to sustain an accident of this sort  as a result of a deflection of the head going forward in this way 

When you say that d' you mean of the disc extrusion

Yes 

Yes it 's uncommon to

When you say perhaps you could clarify your question

I 'll put it a bit more clearly  observation

The question wasn't very clearly phrased

Uhm in fact we know that there was a rupture don't we of the ligament 

Now it is very unusual isn't it to get a rupture of the ligament as a result of a mere forward action of the head 

I I I still don't understand your question

Are you saying that it could 've happened in some other way

I 'm not suggesting that for the moment

No

I 'm just suggesting that the mechanics of this are very unusual  that you get a rupture as a result of the head going straight forward like that 

Well  when the head goes forward you usually do not get a rupture

But you would only get a rupture when it does go forward unless of course you have a a gross hyperextension with the anterior ligament going as well

Does that answer your question

Well it does to some extent because in fact  uhm if we look at the pleading in this case it is intriguing that this man has suffered a fractured dislocation of the spine at the C five level 

Is that in fact a fractured dislocation of the spine at the C five level in this case

There is no as I recall and I need just to go back and confirm it with the notes and X-rays I have not seen any evidence of fracturing 

Dislocation

It was not dislocated when the first X-ray was taken

It might have been dislocated during the process of the accident and then relocated

Yes

I have to ask

and I don't want to  because uhm Doctor word has looked at the notes this morning and can't find uhm any evidence in the notes of a fractured dislocation of the spine at the C five level

Yes the the problem

Yes when you talk of a fracture

Fracture of course is breakage of the bone

Yes

I haven't seen any evidence of that

Dislocation means a displacement of one bone relative to another  which might have happened at the time of injury but was not in evidence when he was operated on 

What we have what the surgeon found was

he confirmed what was found pre-operatively which was that of protrusion presumably from a disc which he confirmed at operation which had extruded anteriorly  and had extruded through a torn posterior longitudinal ligament 

So it wasn't dislocated in the sense of being displaced one bone relative to another

Uh you were telling us on Friday what advice you would give to Manulite if they were uh the owners of the brown wall

Just want you to alter the scenario very slightly

Manulite are still the owners of the brown wall  occupied by a tenant of theirs

And you get instructions from Manulite

Go off and do a schedule of dilapidations for this job 

And you come to the brown wall  and you see the condition in which it t stands as described by uh your client 

What d' you say in your schedule of dilapidations 

Do I have the benefit of P C Ninety-four when I do the inspection

You know all that we know about the wall 

I would refer to the covenant in the lease concerning uh the ob the tenant 's obligations

Full repairing lease 

I 'd ask the tenant to  either rebuild or underpin the wall 

Yeah 

Now  can we  uhm  move on in bundle five  two eighty 

that was  uh  when you sent  the report to Scott Cooper and Fox and Harrison isn't it 

Yes 

Right

Yes

And that was when you told those two what had been decided about uh  work to the wall 

Yes 

And then on the same day page two eight one  uh  you  send an update to Gareth Thomas don't you 

And after the five items you say the work that the above now progressing as our discussions on Wednesday and Thursday which would be the third and fourth of February

Right 

Yes 

And then  in the uh next two letters page  two eight two and two eight three  uhm  the uh clients Manulite  uh make it plain that if you were talking about underpinning rather than cosmetic it was cosmetic that they wanted 

Yes 

Uhm 

Now we come to two eight four which was Mr Harrison 's uh  reply to your letter of the fifth 

Uhm 

Now  how did you react to receiving this letter Mr Bailey 

That as we uhm  were going to carry out cosmetic repair  my client was  going to be asked to produce an indemnity 

And that you regarded as quite unacceptable  did you

Yes 

And uh did you therefore decide  simply to press  on with the instructions that Manulite had given  and to resist any attempt  by or on behalf of the people next door to secure any wider remedy than that

No

I wrote to Mr Harrison explaining to him the situation 

So are you saying you were prepared to discuss  negotiate  and amend the proposals

Yes 

Well we 'll see 

Page two eight five 

You get 

This is another memorandum of yours isn't it

Yes

It is

And you get a phone call from Scott Cooper

I suppose that 's Ian Scott Cooper is it

I believe it was

Yes 

And uh having recorded the matter  and given  certain advice to Mr Scott Cooper as he was concerned  you met uh  Mr Scott Cooper with Mr Hargreaves on the site

Is that right

That 's correct

Yes 

Uhm

just let 's see what the uh condition was at the time by reference to the photographs 

We speak of brickwork being removed to allow uh rebuilding 

Can you pick a photograph that uh shows us the position 

For example  uh does forty-nine show us what was happening there 

Yes

I believe it does

Right 

Uhm so you then went having seen the uh wall you went to see the Scott Coopers

No

I don't believe that 's correct

Yeah

I think I went straight to see the Scott Coopers

You think you went straight in 

But uhm  was the uh  theme uh of Ian Scott Cooper  the same as he was telling My Lord in the witness box

cosmetics are not repair

and we want the wall repaired 

No

The theme was that uhm Mr Ian Scott Cooper wanted the underpinning works carried out

Yes

Because  I I 'm putting it to you he was saying that cosmetic treatment is not the same as repair 

No

I don't agree

I daresay you don't agree

Was what Mr Scott Cooper was putting to you  his view that cosmetic treatment was not repair 

No

I don't believe he put it in that way

No 

And uh  you and Mr Hargreaves explained on the matter of underpinning that it wasn't simple  would necessitate removal of their rear wall  as underpinning alone wasn't a practical proposition and so on

In other words you 're saying if you 're going to do anything more radical than cosmetic treatment you 've got to take this wall down and rebuild it 

That 's the effect isn't it

I felt so

Yes

Yes 

And then uh  you mentioned a very high risk of disturbance to other areas of the property uh currently undisturbed 

Uhm 

That 's rather overstating it isn't it uh  Mr Basnett

The risk surely is not to the part any parts of the property that were built on proper foundations but merely to those parts that were founded above the level of peat

Wouldn't you agree

No

I don't agree 

Then uh  you added 

Uhm 

Now why did you say that the loadings would be greatly reduced

Was that guesswork or were you relying on something specific 

I believe the roofing scheme res resulted in the reduction of the loading the loading  coupled with the removal of the first floor store 

Uhm 

Did you apply your mind to the question of whether the load from the first floor extension  uhm bore upon the blue wall 

Yes 

You assumed that it did

Sorry

And you assumed that it did did you 

No 

You assumed that it didn't

Yes 

So as regards the blue wall  you were really taking the view that the roof structure that was being put on again would be lighter than the roof structure that had been taken off

Yes 

Did you realise that uh the redesign of the roof meant that in terms of roof loading  the blue wall would be carrying a substantially greater part of the roof than before 

Sorry

Could you repeat the question

Did you realise at the time that because of the redesign of the roof  and I 'll add to that because of the uh purlins that were coming to rest on the blue wall  the blue wall would be carrying a greater part of the roof load  than it had under the old roof

I didn't treat the walls in isolation

Oh I see 

If you had realised at the time  that as a result of the uh  alteration work to number fifty A  the blue wall would be carrying a greater load than before  would your attitude to the Scott Coopers on the twelfth have been different 

Could you repeat the question please

If you had appreciated that as a result of the alteration work to number fifty A  the blue wall would be carrying a greater load than before  would your attitude to the Scott Coopers on the twelfth have been different 

It would 've depended been dependent upon the uhm  th the size of the increase in the load 

It would 've been dependent on the size of the increase

So I suppose your answer is possibly but you 'd 've had to give it closer consideration

Would that be fair

Yes 

Yes 

Uhm 

Then there 's the discussion about ownership of the party wall

and we 've if we look at page two eight six 

You point out that our client that 's Manulite was also looking into ownership of the wall  and later that afternoon Gareth Thomas confirmed that the deeds were signed and therefore in view of the construction there the wall could probably be considered a party wall 

That was was that Thomas talking to you or you talking to Thomas 

This therefore in view of the construction 

No

I can't I can't remember 

There wasn't something that uh you said to the Scott Coopers was it on the property 

Sorry 

Uhm you weren't saying to the Scott Coopers as the construction suggests  that uh  this wall isn't owned by you the Scott Coopers 

The reflection of what I said is at the bottom of page two eight five 

Yes 

Well we can see what you say that you said 

What were you trying to put across

That we had supports already in the wall

Yes 

Well no doubt 

But uh that went to rights against the wall and not to ownership didn't it 

Yes

I was more concerned with the support

I see 

Uhm now in the very last sentence when you point out  to the Scott Coopers that the wall had in fact originally extended across part of the width of fifty A  are you talking of the green wall as was or of something else 

I believe I 'm talking about the green wall

Yes 

Uhm 

Then back on page two eight six you got the message that the Scott Coopers wanted you to stop work until their surveyor had inspected

Uh  had you realised before this meeting that uh the Scott Coopers ' surveyor hadn't yet been to the premises 

I didn't think he had been

Mm 

Pretty reasonable suggestion wasn't it for uh work to halt so that the two surveyors could get together 

It wasn't put like that 

Wasn't put like that 

So uh  if it had been put like that you might have taken a different attitude

is that what you 're saying

Well no

My attitude was  in that particular instance the fact that uh th the media w uhm brickwork had been taken down in the corner of the blue and brown wall 

I know that I did I did not want to leave it open over night

In fact the repairs were already in hand 

You could 've sheeted it over or something 

No

No 

But the state of the wall was all your doing your decision wasn't it Mr Basnett 

You were the chap that had it  uh  knocked down to that point 

The state of the wall was as we found it 

The state of the wall was just as you found it 

Uh but the brickwork  in the corner  state of repair

Yes 

That 's what I 'm putting to you

The state of the wall  uh the state in which you found the wall was the result of the work that you had directed to be done to the wall  wasn't it

Yes

Uhm 

What was the point of the last paragraph 

You pointing out a void to the rear of the premises that belonged to Scott Cooper and it was in poor condition 

The contractor was concerned about the condition of the covers that were in that area

I 'm sorry you 've dropped your voice

The contrac contractor was concerned about the condition of some covers  over a void in that area 

The condition of some covers

Yeah 

There 's a void there which was covered over

But uh this wasn't even on the uh Manulite property was it

It was on the retaining wall the return wall

No

No

We didn't know whose property w it was on

We thought it was on Scott Cooper 's property but then we found out it wasn't 

Uh well

I won't spend time on things that don't carry us further 

And then the next thing that happens  is that your arranged meeting with Mr Harrison takes place

And we 've got your note on page two eight seven haven't we

Yes 

Uhm 

And in the second paragraph  you say  nothing 's been done to the party wall to increase the loading

But  there are your clients from Scott Cooper 's at once claiming there 's been internal damage 

Did you question  that the crack to the main retail wall  had been caused by the building works in some way Mr Basnett 

I may have done but it 's not recorded here

No 

And the fact is  uhm you could see for yourself that the crack to the main retail wall  uh wallpaper must 've been caused in some way by the building works couldn't you 

Yeah

Quite possibly  

And then uh third paragraph you discuss the rear right corner the corner with the blue and brown walls 

And Harrison says you wanted to carry out purely cosmetic treatment

And yet uh you had damaged  uh the property next door

And you were saying movement long standing because you 've got fractures elsewhere and by the works proposed you were decreasing and not increasing the loading

The sentence

in practice the hysteric is not infrequently a malingerer too 

Is that one with which you agree

Yes

I I would my Lord because  my cap my experience of hysteria and treating hysteria  is  that the concept of it starts with an idea 

Slater himself says that and that 's always been my

It starts with a purpose 

Now we then come back onto this concept which psychiatrists have of the unconscious 

Now I have always believed in treating people with hysteria and trying to get rid of the paralysis  that it started as a wish a desire to do something say to a paralysed arm that would prevent them which would i improve their life or alter the situation and it started a as a conscious desi a conscious wish

Now you can argue that over the course of months or years  that may have been forgotten

What may have been doctor

The original idea the original concept

Yes

When you uhm therefore say that you agree with the sentence in practice the hysteric is not infrequently a malingerer too  it must follow from the very terms of that sentence  that sometimes there are hysterics who are not  malingerers too

Yes

Yes

I mean don't bother to elaborate

I mean

if if

if if

Yes is good enough for my purposes cos I was going on to ask you

I think again one would have to one would have to put a reserved yes to that My Lord because  i i it would be a question as to how you looked at the case

I mean I I 'll give you a an ex a common example

In my life I have seen a lot of patients a large number of patients who 've had a paralysed arm 

I 've examined that patient and said to myself this is not organic 

I would then say to the patient look this this is not due to anything organic

You must have some problem

You 've got some  trouble or something of this sort

I then find that there is  an impossible situation in the family  say an unfaithful husband or something like that 

The paralysis is to produce a is to have a purpose to prevent say the husband from going on business trips or something of this sort 

Now I would say that is hysterical

That is a hysterical paralysis 

But you can equally well say or the husband could say that that is malingering

It 's a question which side you look at it from 

So the distinction is very very blurred and it 's a question as to what the motivation for it is as I inter as I understand the situation 

And if one contemplates an hysteric who is not a malingerer  because you will agree then with what this sentence must envisage that there are such people uh why does one say that uhm there 's an hysteric  who 's not malingering

What what are you looking at in those circumstances

My Lord I don't believe that uh I as a neurologist

I think most neurologists would would uhm say the same that you that one can distinguish  hysteria from malingering

Hysteria is a gentler word 

If uh if a patient came to me and I uh they had a paralysed arm and I said it would have been uh that it 's not organic I would be very very fright I would be very reluctant to say that this is malingering

It 's just that we 

Uh of course the other problem  is that you know we might be wrong

It might not be it might be organic when one so that one is in an anxiety in that way 

But I do and uh

One of the early days of the trial I think counsel produced a student textbook  by two respected figures Henry Miller and uh Brian Matthews a professor of neurology at Oxford

and if I remember the sentence that was read out it said that hysteria could not be  distinguished from malingering 

That was where uh uh

And that 's certainly my view

Can I see this 

Where do I find that 

I mean do I get while it 's being looked for Doctor Hieroms do I get the impression that you are really saying that there 's no such thing as someone suffering from take a paralysed arm which is as good an example as any without there being a degree of deliberate  uh conscious  motivation

I am My Lord

At the onset  at the onset 

I believe that it 's a it 's a formulation in the patient 's mind that uhm

Uhm I cast my mind back to 

Just

just

just forgive me if you would just a moment 

What I 've written down is this 

I say there is no hysteric who at the onset has not have a deliberate conscious motivation

We 're speaking My Lord in terms of a of hysterical paralysis 

Yes

No one suffering from hysterical paralysis is that

is that right

Yes

Yes 

Uhm

You were going to go on  to say something about war time

Well I 

War time uhm

My experience

at the end of the last uhm war when I was a psychiatrist  in the navy we would see this uh type of case

and we were confronted

 this problem was that uh a sailor was due to be his ship was due to was due to go to sea and uh he was terrified  and paralysis of the arm developed

And it was a uh our dilemma then was was the anxiety of sufficient intensity

I mean clearly someone who was absolutely terrif terrified by this situation

it was open to to to great uh debate as to whether that was hysterical whether it was malingering whether the terror was of such intensity

Now  of course there is some com there is some uhm if I 'm talking too much My Lord

But say under hypnosis

it is possible to get a person to have a paralysed arm under hypnosis

Now there you might say there is no wish on the patient 's part

The wish the idea has been put into the mind by somebody else  but yet it comes from that individual

They 're accepting the suggestion

Some individuals couldn't be hypnotised and you couldn't produce that  but to a large proportion of the population you could hypnotise them and say to them under hypnosis  your left arm is paralysed 

You cannot move the hand you can't move the wrist you can't move the elbow

When they woke up they wouldn't be able to move

How does hysterical blindness fit into this

Well ag a a

again that is a that is a a different uh that is a different type of uh of uh hysteria and again now which is extremely rare  but which in the First World War was a a problem of great frequency

and it was the same sort of thing

They didn't the patient said he didn't see 

Yes I was about to  how it fitted in



Well again it 's it 's it is autosuggestion that uh if I might use that word

The patient is suggesting it to himself

But how did he do it at the beginning

You say that at the beginning he would deliberately and consciously although he can see say to himself I can't see  and therefore not see

Yes

Yes

Yes

And grad and gradually the idea would take over in his mind 

I mean it is certainly it is certainly a condition hysterical blindness

What do you think

Oh indeed 

I 'm just wondering how how under your uhm 

I was only wondering how it functions 

If the man can in fact see  and deliberately and consciously says  that he can't  well I mean he just can 

Now how does that convert itself into

Eventually he convinces he eventually he he

He can't see because he doesn't 

I don't understand the workings of it but I do believe that certainly the number of cases of hysterical blindness that I 've seen in my life is relatively small 

The number of cases of hysterical paralysis that I 've seen is low

I was only testing your thesis by considering hysterical blindness

Remember

I must say I find very great difficulty in the concept  that a man who can in fact see and knows that he can see  but says that he can't see in some fashion  then manages to  get himself into a state in which in practice his mind tells him he can't see

Yes

My Lord it is possible with the the treatment of this condition hysterical blindness and hysterical paralysis that you sit down with the patient and reassure him and say to him that you can do something

And I 'm sure that uh people who 've treated hysterical blindness  with with with within an hour or two they would move from a state of blindness to seeing normally

Well that bit I can understand

but I

That I can

So the converse has come about

That I can understand very readily 

It 's the idea that you start off consciously  deliberately  saying I can't see when in fact you can and you know you can and you then somehow  persuade yourself into a state of actual blindness

I think I think the the the other of course the the basic problem is the the motivation

What is the basis for it

What is the the intolerable situation which brought the individual to to this state 

As Slater tells in that second paragraph it comes from an idea 

Well an idea in my view

He obviously believes or I suspect that he believes  that that is conscious because in this first paragraph of his definition he  he has some  one has a feeling that he has some doubt about the unconscious 

The other thing I wanted to ask you before  Mr Barnett takes you on to the next stage of your evidence is this 

Dr Kendall said this

From what you 've been saying if I understand it you wouldn't agree with that

I 'm sorry could I hear Kendall again

Yes indeed 

uh the other the other I 'm not certain about that My Lord but the other great worker on hysteria

Yes please don't bother for a moment because merely I wanted to know whether you disagree as I think you might do from what you 've been saying with that passage that I 've quoted from Dr Kendall 's evidence

Yes I think I do My Lord

Thank you

Why do you disagree with that Dr Hieroms 

I  I don't believe My Lord that the mind that the mind works in toto that

I find it very difficult to believe this business of the subconscious that you can have a bit of the mind working in a mischievous way 

uh but I I just don't know uh  difficult uhm 

That 's my that 's my view of hysteria that it 's

and I repeat it that I believe it starts in a conscious way 

and that has been my experience in treating these patients  that I 've had the strong impression that when it started  they knew what it was what was going on

Now  Dr Hieroms jumping ahead a bit because I 'm going to deal in part with your report uhm to ask you to explain it

but would you jump ahead now to uhm the final paragraph of your report which will be found at uhm page eighty-six in the bundle 

Page eighty-two in fact Dr Hieroms 

I 've got my own report

The last page

The last page

Paragraph

It it it 's under opinions

Yes thank you very much

Under opinions first paragraph 

Yes

You say this 

Then you go on to say this  

Now how does that fit in with what you 've just told My Lord 

Yes

Yes

My Lord I would 

I think when I wrote my report  there were a number of unanswered problems in my questions in my mind about the severity of the accident and I hadn't seen uh records and uhm  I know that it 's a problem of uh 

I was a bit unwilling to  make this distinction between hysteria and malingering at that point in time because I didn't feel I had enough information

Which bit do you want to start with first 

Now then

Uhm 

Did you

Have you uhm requested they brick up that uh window or not 

They seem to 've bricked up few-syllables

I 've spoken to them yes

Now wait a minute

I 've spoken to them yes and you 've spoken to Sly

haven't you

Yes

Yes

Uh and uh

I didn't say anything  you know  definitely

like

definitely go ahead

and do it 

I don't think 

Maybe I did

I spoke to the men at

Because they 've they 've they it looks as if they 've almost completed their brickwork up there

They have yeah

Yes they have 

You mentioned it to Sly

did you

Yes

Well you know make up your mind before they decide to strike the scaffolding because I think it would be rather awkward to do

I know

They 've got the scaffoldings for some time yet

And they 've got they 've got some  covering up the gap

Uhm

I haven't checked

Have you had a look to see if they 've done it

No they can't have done it

can they

They might have done it but I doubt it

If you haven't given them the thumb

Uhm

No they won't do in the unless you give them an instruction  because

Uhm

Well I

Yes I

I 've only spoken to the men so far

so if you 've only said possibly to the to Salarno then he won't have gone ahead

But I 've said definitely to the men  because Salarno 

 

Oh well

Well  we 'll see where that gets us

Is it a bit

Is it uhm

Are you a bit uhm more uhm 

Is it a little easier on the dust now is it now that they 've sort of  covered the hole back up again 

Bit better  

Uhm

I 'd pointed out to them they had uh problems with the sink but uh they said they 'd look at it when they cleaned it up but I haven't looked at it since 

I 'll probably have an inspection

Well at least you made a point note of it  and if it is chipped or damaged they can replace it for you

 yeah

Just so 

Right let 's fire off 

Yes you might as well start up there

Yeah

Yes right 

You 've come to a decision on what you wanted to do 

Yes

Yes 

It was that one 

Yes

Oh you 've actually come round to that have you

Yes uhm uhm

Oh well

Oh

Am I am I I 'm that am I that persuasive

 No 

Well you may be

We 're

Well you 're so persuasive we didn't even notice it

Yes

Notice 

 Uhm and I 'll give you a uhm

I 'll I 'll put in a a thousand tray

Yes

We went up with a tape measure and decided that

And we 'll put it on a a raised platform a plinth

so in actual fact what you 'll have is a will be a step  before you step into the shower 

and so you can uh we can get access to all this plumbing because th the uhm 

Now that it 's

Well let me think

Yeah now that uhm  now that we 've got a longer tray its the waste has got to be at the front here  so you 've got to have something removable at the front so you can get to it and so they can actually sort of plumb it in properly but that 's uh 

Yeah it 'll be fine

Yes

Yeah

Good

OK 

Good 

Now how big 's that step going to be

Yes I was going to say I think  little step as possible 

What is that measurement actually

Have you got the measurement there

Well I can make the step sort of uhm  just sort of

Yeah

Well

Uhm don't know about it being little

I mean where are we going to stand when you come out of the shower

That 's the point 

Oh sorry

Yeah I wasn't thinking about that Let me just

uhm  let me just draw on the on  on the  See where it

uh  see where it comes 

On standing 

Quite

Uhm

That 's the tray

What I 'd imagined doing is yo yo we

Because it 's one step you want a reasonable platform I think 

Uhm  though I suppose  if you 're opening a door you don't want to have to sort of have to step back off the platform to open the door

But you won't uhm

Are we having a door  there

You 're going to have a a shower door aren't you

Shower door

sorry yes we were thinking of the possibility of the double

Yes

Uhm the double

The double one yeah

Yeah yeah which makes makes uhm

Makes it smaller

Yeah 

Like so 

Uhm

That 's it 

Well I th I would th

I 'd obviously s 

You won't be able to have it in such a position you are able to reach over it so you can open the door step on the step and step in

and so I mean  uh probably something about a foot deep I would 've thought you know in front of the tr the tray 

So you step from there to there and in in into the shower 

Yes 

 

Well

The only thing about

Uh I suppose that 's realistic

It 's just a question of where you stand 

Well it can be shallower than that and sort of you know just to sort of 

Mind you you 'll probably in the shower and dry anyway

But I mean where are you going to put towels uh

Uhm 

Well towels you 'll have to we 'll have

you 'll have to sort of put a hook on the wall yeah

What

a hook or something

a hook for a towel

Yeah

Or you could put one either side in actual fact  if you so want to

Because I don't know 

I 'm not quite sure how these doors operate

I don't

They might there might be a priority on one of them

They might sort of have a cover on one side so you can only open one against the other 

I don't know

Or they might just have a rubber seal in between them so you can close them together 

Who knows

But uhm 

Yes even if even if there 's a hook down here beyond the

Or two hooks or three hooks beyond the uh the doors

that 'll be plenty because you can easily reach out and grab a grab a towel  without any problem at all 

We 're not talking of any great distance  I mean

we 're talking 

Yes



Uhm

No 

Yeah yeah sort of  sort of one f sort of one foot six at the most

Yeah 

And two foot at the very uh greatest stretch

Of your arms you know at least

From inside the shower

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah 

And the shower head would presumably be on this wall

The shower head would have to be on this wall

yes

So in actual fact uh I 'd I 'd centre it so if you want if you know h two people are having a shower together  uhm in in both equally get sprayed as it were 

Yeah 

And would you do any sort of inset for soap

You can have a soap dish yeah

Well soap dishes aren't inset generally speaking 

Uh they generally uhm  gen they generally sort of in the same plane as a tile and they project slightly

Given there 's a big uhm given it 's a biggish shower they 'll probably find a corner  where it won't get too soaked

It 's quite wide

Yeah or or or or d or d or down at one end probably best you know so it 's not not filling up with water at o one

Actually the ideal place for a soap tray is under the shower so it doesn't fill up with water

Yeah

Uhm



yeah is under the shower yeah

Yes

Exactly

Quite

That 's where they normally go but you 'll 

Depending on what kind of uhm  thermostatic control you have there are uh

S some showers come with two s two sets of controls 

You have a sort of a  a water supply on off  and then you have a separate thermostat  or sometimes they 're both combined in one unit

Yeah

Uhm uhm 

So depending on how much wall space you eat up with controls  that 'll sort of  dictate where the uh where you put the uhm  the soap dish 

But uhm  I 'm going to specify something  anyhow  regarding the shower equipment  which uhm

and it 'll be pretty good quality stuff  that a builder can put a price on 

and should you want to change your mind then it 's entirely up to you

but at least there 'll be a price down there to measure the job against  you know in terms of cost

Because showers are quite expensive things

Uhm uhm

Uhm

Yeah

Yeah 

That tray 's going to

I

The tray 's going to cost about a 

In fact the chap gave me a price over the telephone 

it 's about a hundred and forty quid or something like this

Yes but I don't think you gave it to me you know

No I just gave you the size

No I I I have to phone up uh uh Aston Matthews the place in Essex Road 

Yeah

It 's worth a visit because it 's quite close to you really

it 's a bit bit of a nuisance parking down there but they are open on Saturday mornings f from sort of about ten o'clock to one o'clock or two o'clock

Uhm

Uhm uhm

Might go and see about taps and things like that

And

Yes they 'd do taps and showers 

Yes

They do everything but uhm uhm  rather than actually buy stuff from them  direct it 's just as well to make out that you might be buying from them but just to get a get a an idea of the manufacture and whoever does the job c might be able to get it from their own merchant elsewhere  which 'll save money

Uhm

Yes

Because Aston Matthews are quite expensive 

And sometimes you know it 's a bit of a bore having to drive all the way down there if they haven't given you all the parts which uhm  is what happened to the chap that did Bo Rob and Barbara 's 

Uhm

And in it wastes so much time

Yeah

Uhm and I 've actually sort of sent out uhm  phoned this chap up  and uh  in fact I spoke to his wife not to him

He 's he 's doing a job in France at the moment 

Uhm so when he gets back this weekend they 'll be able to let me know  uhm if he can do the work and price for it

He 's very reasonable 

He 's very good

You just have to speak to Rod 

he 'll give a  a reference

Uhm uhm

Right 

Good OK

Right

Let 's move on to the next thing

Is there anything else in the bathroom you want to uh 

Because what I 'll do now I 'll uh 

I 'll write a little specification for this 

I can do some pictures of uh  the dado rail and specify one or two things 

so in actual fact o every item of work can be priced 

Right

Have they taken this window out while while doing the brickwork

They just left it in position

All right OK 

No

There 's a piece of plaster 's come off the ceiling

so they 'll replaster the ceiling as well

Yeah 

Uhm I 'll have a look at that before I go just to

If there 's anything you want that they can do now I 'll I 'll let you know 

Yes you 'll keep us in touch

There 's nothing special to say about bricking out the window 

They won't take it out

will they

No no no

Just return the brickwork as it was originally because it 's uh uh

They just

The the the previous builders bashed a hole in it you know 

they didn't even make the reveals good

there 's just sort of ragged brickwork 

You know it 's most unprofessional 

The maintenance for the children that you 've worked out  uhm  is something that you and I have discussed on we discussed it on the phone

I mean 

Uhm

Uhm

It 's not actually as written down there  I don't think  uhm because  that 's right and then that uhm  we then uh  decided to knock out  holidays for some reason

There there 's a whole lot of paper on this which I don't seem to 've got

Here this this though says that Bernard will meet the cost of the children 's holidays and I will meet the cost of holidays they spend with me and we reckoned that that might amount to about fifteen hundred of this sum 

So that if you uhm  knock that out as uh  something that didn't enter into it it came down to  more like six thousand  per annum  which was then split up in this fashion 

Oh right 

This is saying seven four three six fifty per cent

Yes

OK

I mean

is it six thousand  the the figure that was agreed

or is it

Well i i i it

Yes it 's six thousand 

Right OK  so

As I understand it

 figure   six thousand

Bernard 's gone to Morag Smith hasn't he

Yes



Uhm  six thousand not seven four three six

but still split in the same way

Uhm uhm 

OK 

So you then get three thousand a year  for the children and make some contribution yourself

Uhm

Uhm 

I think uh

  this says

for each

and it shouldn't be for each 

Right yes I thought that was pretty high 

That 's why I sounded slightly disappointed 

Fourteen thousand pounds  for the children

I kind of assumed it was wrong because from what we 'd been speaking about on the telephone  uhm 

OK

I think you really do need to see how you go on that and if that a a and whether that is sufficient or not

Right yes yes

I have said that I 'll keep a note of what I spend on them

I 'm finding that totally impossible

Yeah that 's right

Well I 'm not surprised actually

It 's absolutely

I mean

what with you know  all the things that uh that are going at the moment  uhm you know trying to uh do homework on  every little purchase is to you know 

Is it two fifths me and three fifths him or is it  what we 've decided and things like that 

I I don't think I could cope  

Uhm



Uhm uhm uhm

I mean 

at the moment are you thinking of just making a list of what you spend never mind whether it 's two fifty or three fifty

That was the idea

And that yeah

Uhm

But also it 's so much  uh so unsettled  uhm where the children are at the moment

you know we 're deciding it  with luck a few days in advance  which is not good for them

I mean I r realise that that 's very worrying but it 's  I mean it 's different since Bernard 's  not at work  uh i

it 's different because uhm  my daughter is uhm giving me really prime stick  

Uhm

Yeah

Right yes

Oh you know she 's just at that age

she 's  isn't she wow

She 's just at that age

And uhm  she 's uh being  a most amazing thundercloud which is making life extremely difficult

Yeah I 'll bet

So uh  you you know what with uh her wanting to be one place or another or not with us at all because she wants to go and stay with a friend or  uhm and and you know all sorts of unforeseen  uhm little things coming up

I mean to be I quite honestly haven't given it a thought

Right well I 've I 'm  not surprised in a lot of ways

Uhm

I mean with the situation so fluid at the moment I don't think you can do that uhm 

mean if if it settles down and some pattern emerges  uhm then  I suppose what you could do instead of sort of you know constantly keeping this whole list stuff the whole time which is a real pain to do 

Uhm

when it does settle down and if you had a a less pressurised week  and say take a week and actually try and make a note of what you 've spent and then  re in thinking on top of that  of uh well is there enough money here for the children 's clothing for instance over the period of a year 

Uhm

given that things you 're going to have to buy for them like you know school shoes and trainers and football boots and you know tennis shoes and things like that 

Uhm 

Uhm uhm

Uhm uhm uhm uhm

Uhm

Uhm uhm uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

uhm uhm

Yes yes yes

Uhm

I could do that in about September  but before that I can't see it happening realistically 

Yeah

Well otherwise I mean the alternative is is is not to you know not to make a list like that because it is incredibly difficult because you know any any month is going to be different because their needs are are different in that in that period

Uhm 

I suppose it 'd be just to sort of  target various things

I mean go for six months

and see  you know see how it feels

I mean if it feels no there isn't enough here I mean we 're really sort of  scraping or Gavin is making too much of a contribution in as far as the children are concerned because that  on i inevitably that 's what 's going to 

It 's that 's what 's going to happen 

uhm

I mean it 's unlikely that you 're going to say something you can only have one tennis shoe or something you know

Uhm  and just do it by feel you know this

you know this isn't working

I think another thousand a year would  would do it

or I think another two thousand a year would do it or whatever

Uhm  and and

Yeah I know but you see it is very difficult to to to be very detailed

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm uhm

Yes yes

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm uhm uhm uhm

Uhm exactly yes

Yes yes

No yes no yes no exactly

Uhm

Uhm uhm uhm uhm 



Uhm

Uhm

What you could do though would be for instance to keep the receipts for the children 's clothing

Uhm yes

Uhm

because I think that 's an item which is always really quite difficult to assess

It 's quite large quite definitely children too yes

Uhm yes yes yes it is

Uhm  and

and I think actually it 's quite telling because if you were to do that and add it up at the end of the six months you think

oh

you know I had to 

That was more than I thought

I had to rekit  for all sorts of things

Uhm uhm

Uhm

Uhm

I think that would give you an indication of the sort of the level  o o of expenditure which uhm that 's needed 

Because I think that 's actually usually and especially with children of the ages they are  a pretty big item of expenditure

and I think inevitably people say

oh

well

I 'll just put down you know forty pounds a month or something

and uhm that 'll do it

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm uhm uhm

Uhm uhm

And I just you know  don't think it  it does actually

People always generally underestimate for the children 's clothing  uhm

Uhm

Yes

Uhm

Yes

Yes

So I mean you could do that at least and say

well that 's one item

That 's something that I 'm spending much more on than I than I anticipated when I looked at  uhm  at at these figures

therefore there must be that sort of general increase all round 

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Yes

You 'll find it will be

The other  the other thing to add into that is the business of you know if any contribution from Bernard takes into account  the difference between what he earns and what I earn 

that is completely up the spout because one you know his income  looks rocky two uhm mine is sort of roughly valued at twelve thousand a year  because that was from Lloyds

Well Lloyds was going to show twelve thousand a year but now it 's going to be more like nine thousand gross

Uhm

Right it will

Yes from

I imagine it will be from what  I 've read yes

Yes if not more 

And

Uh but on the other hand I 've been earning  well I mean not comparable sums but but I have been earning much more than I  was earning before  be because there 's been a lot of casual work around

Right 

So

So it 's go it 's actually quite difficult to estimate what your income would would be for the next  six months too

Yes

Uhm uhm

Uhm 

 right uhm

I imagine everybody 's in the same boat with sort of threats of redundancy 

Yes

well

that 's right 

and although I mean it may sound rather sort of vague

but I actually think that with that sort of thing going on  uhm  uh

OK you 've got this

you 've got this far

let 's set this up 

uhm and

and likewise I mean we just really have to keep looking at it if if the situation changes because that 's certainly what would happen uhm  you know as far as a court is concerned

if they were to make an order for maintenance and then somebody 's circumstances change drastically either up or down  uhm you know then  then they 'll vary the order in that way

Uhm

Uhm uhm

Uhm uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm 

has this actually been set up

presumably not 

He hasn't set up a standing order

Yes he has

Oh he has

Yes he has 

OK



All right OK 

Does that still make it look like a good deal for me

or  I was getting sort of fifteen thousand

Well when I was when I

What I meant by good deal was I thought that the capital was  was fine

Capital was good

Uhm

D' you think Morag  generous 

I think the maintenance is

I think she 's agreed to 

Uhm  well she might do cons considering 

I mean what

uh

having sort of run through the agreement and and trying to  check it against this uhm as to who 's having what and how and where  uhm 

and I 've got a couple of queries on  o on some of these policies

but I mean apart from that it it looks as if you 've  you know you 've split it pretty much down the middle without taking into consideration who put what in and how which I think is right  uhm  giving you aiming to give you an extra twenty thousand because of the loss of pension rights 

Of course if he loses his job although his pension rights are  static at that stage uhm they 're not ongoing

 let 's cross that bridge when we come to it

Uhm  I mean I think considering that you 've got another relationship which is a stable relationship  uhm  that that is really you know that is a good deal for you

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm uhm uhm

Because somebody like Morag could quite or somebody who was a solicitor acting for your husband could quite easily argue

well

hang on

you don't need all that capital because actually you know you you are housed and you 've got half help 

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm uhm uhm

Uhm

so it 's not as if you know one is trying to actually rehouse both of you on your own  with room for the children as well

Uhm uhm uhm uhm 

No

I don't feel keen on filling in

All right

I think it 'd be so nice to have a casement here because you could then put  well at least one casement possibly two

You can put pot plants down there

It would be nice 

Uhm

Yeah 

Well yeah

W w what about

I think I think perhaps a couple of places here

Uh solid in the middle

Oh

you mean yeah fixed fixed in the middle

Yes

Yes

I

Uh

well

that would look better I think than the

uh

uh

Couple of casements round the side there



Yes

And tops or not a top 

Tops with ventilation purposes sort of thing 

Uhm 

Two tops

Well all right then

Yeah

That 's right 

What we ought to try and do of course is replace  replace it with fretwork Gavin has over there

Just so that you can

Oh yes

That 's right 

However 

How you do that for eleven hundred plus

Can you

No problem

You must you must you must have templates for around here of course hence 

No

I don't have templates

But I mean I can take the dimensions and I know what that is and I can just size it all up

My joiner would be delighted to spend a couple of days in our workshop fabricating that for you

I 'm going to like that

OK

All right

Three thousand

Well let 's say eleven hundred 

Well no but uhm 

See

We 've got them here on the left

Yeah

Yes

Yeah right

And I can make them

It 's purely and simply the cost

Yeah yeah

Yes

I mean I 've got a client at the moment

They 've just been burgled 

And they have a a a very nice oak  uhm front door which is uh

the blank is about seven foot by three foot 

And uh because the door was smashed i it 's debatable whether it can be repaired

Yes

The repair cost for this door is twelve hundred pounds 

And that 's just to sort it out

A new door is just over two thousand 

And they can't believe it

And in fact this is my  my joinery shop that priced it to me 

But those are the sorts of prices that we are looking at just to do  the panel work

And in fact theirs has got a round head on it 

And it 's got some ornate work in the middle 

And the labour on that door is two thousand pounds 

Mind you the materials are pricey 

You know it 's uhm

Labour is expensive

You 're paying  these days about a hundred and twenty pounds  charge out with any company for a carpenter or a bricklayer or whatever

And these are just  working minimums

I mean

it 's then plus plus 

Uhm  so i i if you look at forming these windows  as  a week 's work then there goes six hundred pounds  in labour 

And then add on the material and the V A T and and the expenses and the rubbish and so on

And and that 's how we build up our estimate 

And I 've not mentioned the small working item called profit which covers my salary 

But even builders have to make a profit 

So w you know you have to decide within the  uhm volume of your budget  as to  the final result that you want to achieve

Yes

Yes

Yes yes yes yes yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm sure yeah

Yes

Oh no

Uhm

Yeah

So uh I think the answer is

could you give us a quote for a double casement

I mean I think we forget the pretty fretwork

Yeah 

Well it 's it 's not it 's not so crucial up here

I mean well actually it is

I mean where there 's a sort of upper storey  it 's all a bit higgledy-piggledy I mean you know

I mean it just cuts out light quite frankly 

I did suggest to Mr Kingsworth earlier in conversation that it might be appropriate to be less precious  about the  aesthetic  layout on the back of the house  whereas the front is obviously much more important 

Now  uh there are people who wouldn't hear of it

They would insist on ripping this out and putting back the  th th th the original box sash windows and saying forget the summer holiday and forget the winter holiday  and forget everything else because that is what they want 

Uh

but I 'm always very careful not to spend clients ' money  unwillingly or unwittingly and to talk them into things which they may prefer not to do 

Uh

but equally I don't want to be saying to you well have this when really you do want something else

So it it 's not my job to talk you into doing anything

but just to

Uhm

Uhm

Yes yes

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm Uhm yes

 there is this

Telephone

Uhm right

Uh where 're we going now 

Right

OK 

Shelf on the top front room OK

Shelf 

You 'll have to bring it with you

I 'll bring it don't worry 

Did you have any further discussions with Furwell on the  layout of the room because what I my last discussion with him  we said we 'd have a shelf along here

Uhm what he wanted

That 's right

Yes

No

Uh he uh he didn't talk to me 

So actually we 'd 

So this is within the bay underneath the sill 

Yes

Within the bay 

Well that 's the question was it

I mean it would be nice to be underneath the sill because that would look nicer

Too low 

But it would make it too low I think

Well the other the only other alternative is is is to fit it  on top of the sill and make it into a false  window sill in itself leaving leave the no th the nosing underneath  to give it the rear support

Yes

 I mean that gives all the rear support which makes it a much easier job anyway doesn't it

Yes

Oh yes

I would 've thought

I mean it you will need a couple of extra supports I would suggest don't you

How wide do you want it to be then 

How deep

Full width

I see

Full width

the whole of the

Sorry the whole width of the window 

Yeah

Yeah

And depth 

And depth would be pretty well  haven't you  could go just inside

Right up to

The bay

Well it would want to 



I mean you want to get a standard size don't you so it would be  oh eighteen 

What would be a standard size

Well i i u the the standard sizing wouldn't worry

But I mean about twenty inches

Right

So if we 're looking at about twenty inches  uhm 

Let 's just take the length 

Oops 

Uh one O five nine

Oh it 's a metric nine

That 's interesting 

Uhm 

Yes so it 's it 's nine foot in length  which is over the size of a standard board

So if we were for example going to use a ply board and cut it out of that that would be eight foot and we need nine 

So

By

It doesn't come in three metre lengths

Well 

not in the width unless we went for something like white melamine

Yes

Now if we use that  and filled in across that would probably come in a three metre length

In fact it would probably come in a four metre length

Yes



Yes

Yeah

So if white melamine is what you 're after there 's no problem 

Problem

Uhm

You hate it

A little bit

Well you 'll also have a problem in that

Actually it would be nicer to have a decent shelf

It will sag as well

and that 's why we 'd put in  several full-width brackets that need to be fairly solid 

Oh we 'd have to put supports

I 'm not too sure 

I would want to be saying probably on that width  guessing the weight that you 're likely to put on it you 'd probably want four brackets along  almost at eighteen-inch centres

Yes 

And supported at the ends of course

Th that wide melamine board does sag

Sag

that 's true

Yes it does

Yeah

What about a

and if it were ply if it were a thick ply

or

Well again we 'd have to join it 

I 'd probably suggest that we join at the centre  so you 've got two four foot six pieces uhm 

W w it would be butt-jointed so you 'd have nothing  uhm by way of a hump in in the middle  and we 'd secure it underneath

So that would be all right

It would want some sort of a front edging on it  which would be  some sort of a nosing  uhm 

What do you intend to use the shelf for 

Uhm

Uhm

No

I would agree yeah

Would be nicer wouldn't it 

Computer kit  desk

Computer kit and mucking about making  

So it wants to come flush off the front

And it wants to be set level

It doesn't want a reverse fall or a positive fall or anything like that on it

Yeah fine

That 's right 

Yes

Level uhm

So

Exactly level

And the height is probably just about right although i its

It 's a wee bit low

It is slight slightly

It is

twenty-eight thirty would be standard but to bring it up above the sash windows is going to cause a problem  so 



Agreed

What about putting legs on it and making it more into an enclosed table type of arrangement 

And come across here let 's say at this point with a supporting strut underneath and a leg

First let 's try an angle bracket

Well angle brackets are going to need to come almost to the bottom of the uh wall there

No

Well no it wouldn't

It 's just to put a piece of wood there and piece of wood here  wood there

That 's how it was done in 

It was very effective

Yeah yeah yes

Either or

Yes

Sorry 

No no

I 've got to get a fix for it 

Feels fairly lightweight

Yeah

That 's true

It does doesn't it uhm

I mean a a there 's a head at this  the standard building construction that these are built to should give me  a stud at sixteen-inch centres 

There 's no guarantee that in this wood there will be a stud at sixteen-inch centres

 so high

Yeah

That 's correct

Well legs would be all right

The choice is yours

I just think this size of legs would be all right for this kind of space

Yeah

Wha how many legs would you think we 'd be talking about with ply

Well the ends will be OK uhm 

If we put in ply  as a shelf I 'd put one centre and then  one centred in the two halves 

So that would be three lengths

And then a batten along the wall  which

You want to get something in front of the backup shelf

So that would be OK

And then  I think I would want to set  just a simple nosing of  uh quadrant or uh uh something like that just to give it a rounded edge and to protect the plywood  finish

That 's right just a simple nosing

In between

Yes

Oh sure yeah

Yes 

So I mean can I how can I compare

Cos like most people I 've already got car insurance and everything else

how can I actually compare what Endsleigh have to offer me in real terms in terms of car insurance to who I 'm with at the moment 

I mean

cos the company I 'm with which is

I don't mind telling you it 's the Co-op 

I 've been with them for years and years and I 've  I mean I 've had of couple of claims where people have driven into the back of me

And although it 's not my fault they 've I 've always had to claim 

You know it 's a no claim thing rather than no blame 

Right

Ah

Well hang on a second

The point is that I 've not lost my  discount because

OK

Oh right

Is that because it was protected though

No 

No

It was because it was their  they actually said it was their fault you see so that they paid all the costs and everything else 

But I mean with those kind of things they were always very very good and very prompt and very quick  uhm

How niggly are Endsleigh about kind of coming to ins inspect cars or actually giving you a good

Oh right

Oh fine sorry

Nothing ever happened

All right

Mmm

It 's pretty quick because I mean we are we are although we 're an agent we 're not we 're not like a broker like Swintons or the Co-op

We will actually although we sell a lot of other people 's insurance we do all the work for it ourselves

We do all the claims work  and everything

So I would actually claim through Endsleigh

Precisely

Through Endsleigh

You 'd only ever speak to Endsleigh so if you 've got a problem you just come in here

You don't you never talk to the insurer

We do all the  the stuff for you 

In fact we hardly talk to the insurer to be honest  cos

uhm

That 's really good

That 's unbelievable

That 's a really good quote

Mm 

OK Ross

Thank you very much

My pleasure

Thanks again

I 'll send you out that

Third time lucky

Yeah

We 'll get there

Good luck

OK

Cheers

Thanks Ross

Bye

Hi

Hi 

Uhm  I want to hand in a claim form  

The only thing is I am fairly certain when I moved I 've moved risk address

When I moved I changed it

I 'm fairly certain I did that but it 's not changed on here

Oh yeah

Right

When did you inform us

In November

End of November

Right

I 'm not s you know

I don't know what 's

OK

You would have had you would have had a new  form if we had the change of address so presumably it 's not on there uh 

Right

The other thing is two-or-three-syllables current cost price but I 'll do that now

I haven't been down for a an estimate yet

Yeah

All you can really do then is just is just put down the same names as they were on the form with the new address

We 'll change it now

But uh if you informed us that 's fine

You are sure you informed us

Yeah

Right

Yeah

Right OK

I can't believe I wouldn't have done cos

You 'd be surprised 

Uhm yeah just put down that you informed us of the address but it 's not been  acknowledged as yet and uhm 

Yeah

And just put down the cost prices

and we 'll bung it off

and they 'll get you sorted out

Right

So in in there

Right 

Uhm if there 's any problem we 've got like the tenancy agreement for when we moved

Right OK

That 's that 's OK

They may they may ask to see that just out of interest

Right OK

So 

This would have been say the first of December when we moved 

Right

Cost prices 

Right

That 's it

 that 's the receipt for the  goods

Fine

No problem

It 's the only receipt I 've got anyway

Yeah

OK fine

I 'll bung all that up to  head office and they 'll take it from there

I 'll get them in touch with you in a couple of weeks time

Right

OK lovely

Cheers

OK 

Thanks

Thank you

Hello

Hi 

I wonder whether you could uhm give me a quote on uhm a motorcycle 

Uh the thing is I 'm not a student 

Does that make any difference to you

Yup

Right

No 

We don't treat you as nicely but ah we can still quote you 

Sure sure sure sure

I 've actually had a previous uh quote from  somebody else  uh Norwich Union

 if you want to see it later

It 's up to you

Right

No problem

No problem

What 's your name and address

I 'll need that to access the computer

OK

It 's uh Dinas Powys

Dinas

D I N  A S  P O W  Y S

And that 's 

All right I was I was looking for the full the full thing  cos we need we need the whole

Yeah

Oh I see

Do you

Yeah

OK

It 's fourteen Bridgeway Road 

Bridgeway

Yeah 

Dinas Powys

And that 's Cardiff is it

Cardiff

Yeah 

OK 

When is your renewal date

Uh well it would be now

Uh I 'm not insured at the moment

OK 

OK

So it 's C F six is the  where you 'll actually be keeping the bike

Yes

It will be

And the bike is

It 's a seven fifty Kawasaki Seven Fifty turbo 

And the year

Uhm  eighty-four

A registration

And value

Uh two thousand two hundred

And do you keep it in a garage

No

It won't be kept in a garage there I 'm afraid

It 's covered in a driveway

OK

And do you want comprehensive or third party fire and theft

Third party fire and theft

Not using it for business or anything

No

Not at all

No 

And your age is

I 'm twenty-seven

And you 've got a full motorbike licence

Ten years

Ten years 

And your occupation

Uhm I 'm a chef 

On licensed premises

I 'm afraid so

Yeah

No accidents claims no convictions

No

Have you any no claims bonus

Yeah

Thirty per cent

Thirty is it

Could I just have a quick look at it just cos companies tend to differentiate quite a lot

Yeah sure

Yeah

I realise that

OK

Whatever you want to have a look at 's there really 

Mm

I was looking for something here 

Nigel you couldn't give us a hand could you 

Thanks 

The quote that they sent me there was only third party only

Oh right 

Yeah 

This has got uhm

How how long have you actually had motor motorbike insurance with these people

Uhm  I 've had motorbike insurance with them for quite some time actually

Uhm for the same bike this would be my I believe my f fourth year

All right

OK 

Yeah this would be the fourth year I think

Yeah this would be my fourth year coming up

Right

Well

what we 've come up with

third party fire and theft three nine one fifty

Gee whizz

Mm

Three nine one fifty

Yup

Oh my goodness

Oh shit

Well we deal with one literally one motorbike scheme and that 's it

We deal with about forty insurance companies for motor  vehicles

but motorbikes we 're down to one

so we 're that limited in our choice

It 's through Lloyds 

mm uhm

Yeah

Good God 

It 's a tremendous amount of money that

Suppose

Yeah

It 's uh

Beyond me at the moment

They 're not cheap at the moment

See what would come up

third party only 

The thing is motorbike  premiums have gone up ridiculously recently

Mm yeah

A lot of people like Norwich Union aren't quoting any more on certain risks

Yeah 

Mm

It doesn't make a lot of difference

It 's a Group nine

That 's what I was doing 

Is it just expensive or is it the job or is it you know

Yeah

It 's just the bike and the fact that it 's expensive at the moment

Just as expensive thing to insure just now

Yeah

OK well did did you want to ask for the car

Yeah

Well I 'm not twenty-one yet

but I will be in July

and I want to insure a car in my  name

And it 's a Polo Thousand 

Right

Right

What 's your name and address

Oh Jane Lawrence 

Lawrence

Right 

At the moment my address is two hundred A  Monkton Street

Monkton

M O N  K T O N

Mm

Monkton  Ramsgate 

And the postcode is

Uh C T twelve  four J N 

Right 

Have you got a daytime telephone number at all

Uhm  O eight four three  eight two one  O four nine 

It is my parents ' address

It 's where the car is at the moment 

And it 's actually this is a car you 've got at the moment

Yeah

It 's my Mum 's car at the moment but I will be having it in July so

Right 

And you 're a student

Yeah

Yeah 

I won't be then though 

I graduate this year

Ah right 

So what are you going to be  do you think

uhm haven't a clue 

I may well end up being a student for another two years

so still a student

You don't know

Right

OK well if you are I mean this this student thing

We obviously do very cheap rates for students anyway so uh

What 's the car

It 's a Polo  Thousand 

And the year

Uh it 's B reg so it 'd be eighty-five

Eighty-six  

And the value 

A thousand or so

I imagine so

Yes

Do you keep it in a garage or on the road

It 's in good condition

At the moment it 's kept in a garage and on a driveway

OK

And it 's right-hand drive

Yeah

And you 're going to be twenty-one did you say

In July

Yeah

And how long have you had a full licence

Uhm  three years

And ah  OK if we call you a student just now uh 

Yeah

That 's right yeah

No accidents claims convictions

No one else to drive

Yeah

No

Oh  there 's my boyfriend

He just came about this

Right 

Not sure if that would be

He 's twenty-eight

Yeah

Twenty-seven

Twenty-seven

And he 's got a full driving licence as well 

And it 'd just be third party fire and theft

Yeah

Yeah 

This is your first insurance in your own name

Yeah 

Uh that 'll either be nine hundred or eleven hundred for the engine size

Do you think it 's which one do you think it 's going to be

Oh Tony is the Polo a nine hundred or eleven hundred

No

It 's a nine

Nine

Yeah

Nine hundred

I thought so

Two hundred and thirty-two fifty 

And that 'd be third party fire and theft for the year 

Uhm that 's rating you as a student uhm

OK

Does it go up or down

It goes up  if you 're not

It goes up

Oh

yeah

cos we 're the  us being a student insurance company we give you a massive discount

We

If you 're a student as well any other quote you get which is better we will guarantee to beat it until the end of June

and then it 'll probably be extended to be honest after that 

So uhm  we can

Yeah

Right OK

And that 's with uh another driver

That 's a named driver

That 's right

If you if you took him off actually it 'd be about a hundred and ninety

Right

So

If he had his own insurance  would it help 

Usually be able to drive 

you 're only

Is that the case 

If he has he got his own motor insurance rather than

Uh not car insurance

No

Not car

No

No

Yeah

Uhm 

you 're better leaving him on then if

Yeah OK

I suppose fully comprehensive is out of this world

Yeah

To be honest on that kind of car it 's not really worth it

Really

Mm

Cos mean if you have

It 's an eighty-five car or whatever

not worth that much comprehensive

You 're going to pay  you know a lot of money for it

Yeah yeah

I think my Mum said

it 's  no claims

and

Comprehensive insurance

Yeah that 's right

Once you build up the no claims it 's easy enough 

But that 's it

I mean give us a call

I 'll send the stuff out to you 

Uhm give us a shout when you 're ready to insure it

We can see what we can do for you

If even if you aren't a student we can still quote you a good rate on it 

OK

Well hopefully I will be again next year

I don't see anything

That 's lovely

Thanks a lot

OK thanks bye

Thanks a lot

Cheers

Bye

Membership of the board

This could be controversial

it may not be

Uh I I would appreciate very much your views on this

Uhm the first is the academically-related staff matter

Uhm 

here we agreed that academically-related staff uh should be able to attend our meeting

but there 's been such uh documentation uh which suggests that uh we might allow some to be permanent members and some to be invited on an ad hoc basis

Uh  and uh it 's really for us to decide

The first step though is to discover who is within the faculty on an academically-related scale

When we had a head of departments ' meeting last week I circulated a piece of paper and several people have returned it to me

Uh there may have been some people who weren't at that meeting who didn't get the piece of paper

If that 's the case would you like to pick one up

and all you have to do for your department is fill in the name of any academically-related member of staff

In that way we 'll at least know uh how many members of the uh departments in the faculty have academically-related staff

At the moment we have no idea 

My guess is it 's a fairly small number probably ten to fifteen  but would you agree that we decide this finally when we know the numbers  but at the moment the arrangement is that such academically-related staff can come 

What are examples of such staff

Well uhm I I 've just taken here

There 's a departmental administrator in history who is on an academically-related scale

Uh the History of Art department has one uh member of staff who 's on an academically-related scale

uh the Map Librarian in Geography is on an academically-related scale and  there are three in English I think

I 'm not quite sure if that 's right actually

Uhm and that 's so far

Oh and Doctor Cockle uh from uhm Classics Greek and Latin of course

He is a member of the board already and quite rightly so and very frequently comes

So that 's the kind of person 

Well it it isn't it wasn't clear from your enquiry if you already knew about research staff who are of course academically-related

Yes

it 's not clear to me whether this injunction applies to those on contract rather than aren't

Uhm uhm I 'm afraid I don't know the answer yet 

Do you

No so people should put down members of research staff

Uhm

Yes

I if that 's relevant yes

Hmm absolutely

But at the moment we 've made a decision and I 'm not proposing to change it until we have other information

My guess is that we 'll probably agree that academically-related staff should be allowed to attend but uh

The second item though is uh a more substantial one

Do we have any uhm students here

Wel welcome

Sorry I didn't see you down there

Good

Uh

the uh matters related to  appendix  one  in which  the total number of student representatives on faculties is said to be forty-nine for reasons that are not clear to me

and these are distri if these are distributed uh pro rata amongst the faculties this faculty instead of having seven student representatives would be expected to have sixteen reflecting of course the enormous size of this faculty I repeat the largest in the college

Many people in the college wouldn't realise that

Huge numbers of students vast numbers of students far too few staff and uh uh so on

Now  I 'd appreciate your your views on this

and I 'd very much like to hear the views of the undergraduates uh th the the students because there is one clear issue

and I 'm sure we 'll agree on that 

We do expect and hope to have some postgraduates here at Professor Leber 's initiative with the postgraduate society and uhm its consequences have led us to encourage postgraduates to participate in our affairs

so however we many we decide on I 'm sure we 'd want some postgraduates as well as undergraduates 

Yes

Yes well you 're very welcome and uh it 's very nice to have you with us 

I my own feeling here and I 'd very much appreciate your views on this because I I don't have a fixed idea at all

but my feeling is that if we move as a faculty towards uhm some of the proposals that will come up at the next faculty meeting but which I 'll mention later that 's to say we recognise some groups of cognate interests within the faculty then I would have thought it sensible that we should have representatives from those groups

Clearly uh sixteen does not allow each department to have a representative uh because we have more than sixteen departments

so we 're going to have to have some kind of scheme which allows reasonable representation

and uh my suggestion would be that we leave this until we 've decided how we wish to uh structure the faculty but to ask if people have views they 'd like to put forward now 

Yes 

H how do you feel because uh as at the moment I think you are nominated by the union aren't you

Or how 'd you come to be elected

OK that 's in your case that 's fine

 within the union  through the E&ampersand;R officer who knows really rather than hold an election it has to be very strict it has to be organised

Uh

we did feel uh union council was two or three weeks ago when this was put to us that uh the increase from seven to sixteen uh was actually a very good idea

uh

however I think we 've got to make more effort more more of an effort to actually encourage students to come and to uh fill the places if we 're going to in increase it

D' you have

What

You say that it 's sort of a customary processes of consultation and we were familiar with that in the faculty of arts

but the uh uh uh

If we 're going to have sixteen presumably we have to have some sort of system to get a reasonable representation of students across the faculty don't we

That 'd be a good idea

yeah

but if you ask the union to appoint the students to come along uh  th the E&ampersand;R officer who 's in charge of it doesn't even want to have to organise a big election or anything like that

and in this case because everything was done in a bit of a rush uh then she just appointed people she knew who were active in the union and who came into the faculty of arts 

Quite

Any other views

Presumably if we 're going to distribute the students in this way according to pro pro rata according to the student uh distribution in the uh college we ought to be doing the same thing within the faculty should we so a big department has more representation than a small department

Yes

Right

Well I I

I can see that this is a an issue that I ought to go away and come to you with a formal proposal on

and I 've no doubt that we 'll all have our own views

We clearly want as good a student representation as we can get

We welcome it

We 're not uh unhappy about it

It 's just a question of how we organise it and what the numbers should be

So would you allow me to take this away and  try and come up with a scheme

and uh I 'll delay it if I may until beyond the next faculty meeting because I think our own structure and proceedings might be a little bit clearer then 

Good

Thank you very much

Uh section one items to report uhm agenda item four course unit proposals

Uh these are still being dealt with uh  by the Dean and the uh Tutor uh till we get our teaching committee

Uh they 're in appendix two any  objections

We 're hap happy ourselves 

Course units in Classical Archaeology

Uhm now  there isn't any uh uh set document on this

Is there anything uh Reggie that uhm you want to say about item five 

Simply that uhm the courses as at present existing will use the former course unit degree

so really it 's simply a notification of change of intent

So there 's no change of uh position

Is that OK 

And then item six is for report

Adam Sedmark has mentioned

that is to say please urge uhm your students to uh uh apply for access funds by the deadline

It 's uh it 's rather absurd that we should have this special fund and that we shouldn't use it when so many students are clearly in finan some form of financial stress

Uh Professor Hombridge









No it 's not a new regulation 

See see what value faculty meetings are to you uh

Is it a fact that  is it the practice now

It it it 's been a requirement for some time

is it the practice now

It 's been a requirement for some time 

This conversation is official so 

Quite some time eh 

I hope Professor Greenbaum is analysing it syntactically 

And  as Ivan said please encourage your students to to go to access funds

It 's very important

Uh eight is report

Nine is report too I think an interesting document which uhm Professor Greenbaum initiated and which I hope everybody uh will have had a chance to digest

Any comments of those that have seen the report 

Yes

Uh  access funds no longer apply to E E C students

No longer

No longer

No longer apply to E E C students 

Shall I comment on section nine

Please

Uhm

that there is a s a standing interest group uhm in computing in humanities which you may or may not know about

Uh unfortunately U C L tends to be very under-represented on it

I go along periodically

Tap the uhm 

I 've written to them asking them to suggest sensible proposals for computing in humanities

and this special interest group is due to respond to that

and it may be of interest to you



Yes indeed I mean firstly I 'm afraid I don't know you

Sorry Dave Guppy Computer Centre

Dave Guppy in the Computer Centre

Right

Uh this humanities group

is this a university group

Yes

OK

It 's

It has an official status in the sense that you may or may not know that computing centres were grouped into so-called coordinating centres of which the Bloomsbury Computer Consortium is one

and at that time it was envisaged that there could be special interest groups uh which would formally represent a special interest

and I think a an on ongoing seminar in humanities computing which has existed for a number of years chose to have changed itself into a special interest group in order to benefit from some kind of official status

Now supposing members of this faculty would like to participate in that

Yes

What do they do

Could you give us a sheet of paper that we can circulate with the next minutes for example

Certainly

Please

I can tell you what their programme is

I mean Professor William Vaughan uh at Birkbeck you see

Who was here of course

That 's right uhm

Now can I ask how many people know about this group 

Well it it 's quite interesting that we have made

We discussed extensively our needs for computing but we 're clearly not taking advantage of some of the possibilities of exploiting that potential uh uh an and need

benefitting that need

I 'm choosing my words carefully because we 're being recorded but you know what I mean

Putting it more accurate it 's a it 's a st a standing issue about this meeting that U C L which ought to be in the forefront and well represented is conspicuous by its absence

It seems to be a great pity

That 's a very helpful contribution thanks

Can you if you could give us a sheet of paper we 'll certainly circulate it uh to everybody who 's uhm

and then you can respond as as is necessary

Thank you

Uh item ten s section two Dean 's communications

What I 've done here I hope you don't entirely disapprove is try and limit the time taken on this item by putting it in writing

Uhm shall I sort of 

I mean there are sort of two well there 's lots and lots of things but we don't want to make a weekend of that

Uh 

I guess 

what we have in mind is whether we can  whether there 's sort of sensible scope for our  working together 

And in terms of  software I suppose concordance of software  can we

uh

I mean I sh I I I I suspect that our requirements are  are fairly sort of t t typical anyway 

But if we can sort of  feed in  our bid our papers  to s sort of try to ensure that whatever whatever software  you develop uh  is something that you know we could utilise

Right

Well I mean our s our corpus is could become very large indeed  if our plans go forward for the for the raising of the funding for the language centre ww are talking about very big money 

And  and and also we 're talking about multilingual  data 

But so I so size is  I guess size is a bigger problem actually than funding  







I mean or I 'm I 'm forgive me for being so terribly unclear about lots and lots of things

But  i is your

Well  my sort of scenario is that we have this database uhm  which we use in the dictionary compilation  which is aimed to be what and I think Ted Briscoe calls a uhm lexicographer 's work station

You know he 's got this phrase he I think that 's his phrase 

Now by a lexicographer 's work station as far as I understand it and as far as I 've sort of envisaged it the lexicographer can work uhm writing definitions and have access to data about specific lexical items or groups of lexical items on the screen in a sort of window-like manner 

Uhm

and interactively instantaneously virtually you know so that if you say

oh I 'm

I 'm defining adrift

give me adrift please

and then we get the citations for adrift

and you know perhaps a more sophisticated system would say

well

spoken citations and written citations and  citations from North America and citations you know  whatever 

Now is that achievable do you think 















Uhm  the the slight problem is uhm you you say you want it according to different categories as

Well not

That would be a second level thing though

Sorry go on 

Uhm no th that would uhm

I just don't know anything that could do that at the moment 

The first the first requirement is catered for by by tons tons of packages

Right

which is

just give me adrift

Yeah 

Yeah

The the the one that says give me adrift but it 'll filter it according to uhm th only adrift spoken by women uhm 

But we would have to code that I guess 

We would have to basically 

We 'd get all the adrifts

and we have some slots coding slots attached to each 



Right 



You see I think of the

That 's the that is an area of difference isn't it because we look at a lexical item we say

this is American English here

You know we 've read this bit of  the New York Times and here 's a bit of American English

as lexicographers we will label it 

But to say this is from the New York Times therefore it 's American English is not very helpful lexicographically cos sort of ninety per cent of the matter is common English of the world 

Well it you could have a an Americanism tag which you 'd insert yourselves

Yes

Right I think that 's what we 'd have to do

We 'd have to have a range of tags  similar to the ones we used in LDOCE for formality level  variety etc  and meaning

You see the most imp

the thing that I really want to explore with you in as part of the language survey idea  is that we should do a we should do a kind of semantic frequency count  of  of words &agrave; la Michael West but sort of ten twenty times bigger than that and using computer plus manpower to achieve it 

Yes

You will

Uhm

Right



Wh what is a semantic frequency count

Well I mean basically uh  basically we we lack we lack reliable evidence about the the frequency of of English meanings  uhm 

Irres irrespective of the word that 's used to uh signify 

Well what I 'm well no not irrespective of the word

No

I mean word forms used in particular meanings

Oh I see yep yep yep

So I mean like entries in a dictionary if you like definition 

Uhm

we don't really have any reliable evidence about how common  the word ball meaning a round plaything  is in relation to the other sort of various ten thousand words

You 'd think we would have 

But it appears that we don't

I I think I 'm right aren't I

I mean

Uhm

Uh uhm

Cos whenever I say this to people they say oh well you know uh this has been done a million times

You know there 's the Brown Corpus and but I 'm not I don't think that Brown provides that actually

No I don't think it does either 

And the only information source I know that does provide it is was done in the thirties manually by a chap called Irving Lorge 

And was the it was the source from which Michael West developed the general service list of English words 

So what we want to do is to do a new general service list for the nineties  large scale and uhm  you know in collaboration  with with yourselves if uhm if it 's of interest to you 

Seems to me it will be a wonderful tool to have you know from all sorts of points of view 

Here at the moment we uhm

And this is one of the  possibilities that we 've considered you know when we were just deciding what software we needed to provide

But we thought we didn't have the resources ourselves to cope with uhm  things like sense disambiguation  uhm uh either manual or semi-automatic 

but we w we were interested

Well we can do that you see but we would do it manually  I think

Maybe we 'd do a pre

I mean I don

people have often talked to me about pre you know pre-scannings which would give you a quite good  sort of first shot 

But when it comes down to it I do think you need human beings  uhm assigning ultimately assigning the meanings

Wou would you and Akiva agree 

Uhm

Yes



Yeah

Right but you

but by using for example pro collocational probabilities  you can uhm  st the the computer program could suggest  the most likely semantic uhm  sen the most likely sense  for each particular word  uh which would probably save you some labour 

Right

Well that will be I mean

to have it pre-sorted with the likelihood

You know

this probably means round plaything sort of thing 

but uhm

Yeah

But we probably don't have enough  uhm

I don't know if a million words would be enough to give you that statistical  uhm information to start off with

No

We w we 're not talking about the Survey providing this

I know that

But I mean  to f to for you y you to use colle collocational probabilities to guess the most likely sense you presumably have to  uh train your your program on a sample 

and then a million 's not enough

No

Right

I see

Is that how that works then  this collocational probability thing

You you basically train 

I think so

Yes

I don't know anything about that console 

I can't see any other way you you you would get the probabilities 

Well take I mean a simple thing like the definite article occurring uh  one or two words  in front of a word  uh which tells you it 's a noun maybe  that sort of thing

Is that the sort of thing we 're talking about 

Yeah

That 's that 's how uhm  one of the ways that word-class ta uh taggers uhm  decide on a word 's word-class

Yes 

Right

You see I mean that 's fairly primitive in a way isn't it

Uhm 

I I mean I 'm I would be quite happy to say that 's a lexicographic task

We 'll code them for meaning and and we 'll hand back the data coded 

That 'll be one of the ways it 's coded 

Well it 's a big task 

but then we 're talking about sort of lexicographers toiling away for many many years doing this kind of thing anyway

I suppose

Uhm

They would just go through the text  the word and then tag

No

We 'd concordance it  first

and then we 'd take the concordanced items

and we 'd assign meanings to each word form 

And say this is this is a round plaything this is a round plaything  this is a dance  this is a round plaything  etc 

Do you know the general service list 

Uhm

No

Michael West

I think there 's a copy around though

It 's quite uh  sort of standard book I 'd imagine just 

Wh wh what 's your timescale for the development of the concordancing software 



Right

Right

Are they actually doing the work now then

Th they 're writing code or



Great

Uh uh

Can I just get it right that you you have texts right you 're going to concordance

Now what you do is you build indexes 

Is that right

You don't you don't chop the text up 

I know I 've asked you this before but I 've forgotten the answer 

You don't chop the texts up into contexts and then hold them as contexts do you 

Are are you with me



Uhm

Uhm I I understand what you do



Nobody would do that

That wouldn't be a sensible thing to do

Uh no some sometimes

Uh  the con the Kaye concordance programme  uhm Ailsa showed you in the Survey uh does that

Right s

so in fact there are lots and lots an of bits of  of little tiny bits of text  being held  which from a kind of retrieval point of view is good is good isn't it 

Yeah

Right yeah

It 's very quick

Yeah

It it uhm takes up an an enormous amount of storage space even with compression techniques 

And uhm  it it also limits what you can search for 

 uh 

iffy

uh 

You can only search with one uh  a w on  words of twenty character strings 

There 's not great flexibility but probably that wouldn't matter to you if  you were only interested in lexical strings 

Yuh

Yuh

I was going to ask Rachel actually if she could just give us a a breakdown of the questionnaire returns we 've had 

Well we 've had ninety-eight back so far uhm  of which only twenty had had started during this year

so the questions that applied only to uh the last six months only applied to seventeen people

So we 're not we haven't got a very clear picture about what 's happening  to th to the new people uhm whether they 're to the degree we 'd expect that 

Even of out of those seventeen only two had been told anything about induction courses and only three had any A U T recruitment literature

And I think one of those that was from the area A U T rep 

It wasn't actually  included

So those are two things that seem to be happening here

Uhm  they come from  thirty-six different departments

Looking at that there seems to be a reasonable spread  

Uhm

How many departments are there altogether

Hundred and one

Oh gosh 

And how many replies

Thirty-six  so far

Uhm

Not a lot

There

Of course not all departments have you know 



But uhm   uhm

You might have guessed

Uhm  the

the thing about uhm  of of these other questions which  have sort of poor results

uhm

uh

they have a proportion of people who didn't know whether anybody had got a discretionary pay rise

And I got the impression that people only knew if they 'd have got one themselves uhm

And  or if nobody had got one then

So that I mean uhm

And only thirty-five per cent of people said they never heard about the procedure for this discretionary award  uhm 

Very few people well no let 's seventeen to eighteen per cent knew about the change of title  uhm 

And just under half get invited to staff meetings 

Only twenty per cent have even heard about faculty fac fac faculty board meetings 

That 's that 's the sort of  worst things I think I 've got 

Right

Yes

What I was going to suggest was that uhm  you know i if you 're able to uh you know have a  bit more of a look at them we 've got our next meeting in College which is something I was going to put down under this is item three under any other urgent business  it reminds me

uhm

Well we 've got a our next meeting of the A U T in College on the eighth of November 

Uhm and Bill Barter and I have been canvassed for dates

so we we need to decide if anybody else should go along to that meeting

And we also ought to think about the business for it

You know I would have thought that implementation and everything we 've agreed based on those questionnaire returns ought to be one of them 

Uhm the other thing is the College is due to give us a response on our package of proposals on parental and other leave 

And uh I was going to suggest that we also raise time off for Union activity  because uh with staff who  subject to the whims of supervisors or who are academic-related and have fixed hours of work we are having problems 

So

And there is a move t in uh in Name A U T as well

We 've had a circular letter round asking if we do have any agreement about recognised time off for uh Union activities because it 's something which uh we 're we 're being encouraged to pursue locally 

So does anybody else uhm have any topics that they feel we should pursue

And  uh you know is anybody interested in in coming along to this meeting 

It 's on the eighth

I it 's a Friday at ten o'clock in the morning

We 're only allowed three reps but we normally manage to get somebody else coming along as well se specialist advice or something 

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

Uhm

What about the uhm business with part-timers

Is that do we need to push on that or

Well we  we need to uh

I mean most of the meeting is normally just looking at the minutes of the last meetings and writing them down

And uh the part-time what 's happening with part-time personnel will come up there

Peter did tell somebody that the Bartlett School have actually now introduced running contracts 

And if that is the case uh then that 's quite a good thing

But obviously it doesn't apply to the Slade which is the other uhm place with part-time staff

 

Who told you I mean Slade that they 're going to introduce per year

three-or-four-words

Well apparently uhm 

We we 've had a problem over the summer with the Slade with losing yet another person

But uhm I understand that of those who remain uh their contractual position is improved in that they 're being offered three year contracts rather than annual renewable  uhm but uh 

And Peter Dear from Personnel tells me that Bartlett have introduced running contracts

But I don't know how many people that would apply to

So we need to find out about that

But if that is the case that at least it 's moves in the right direction 

Oh the other thing is we 've been asked

A U T headquarters are trying to gather any information we have locally about part-time staff

They said they sent a circular to all local associations saying if you 've done any sort of survey or questionnaire can you send the information to A U T headquarters

So is it you Marjorie that 's got the results of our questionnaire or was it Mike

Uhm

Well I 've just started

I did have at one time and Mike had them

But I 'll check

Can you have a look anyway

And if you haven't then uh we 'll ask Mike about it

But anyway A U T are trying to do something nationally about part-timers but they rely on local activity to get them information cos part-time staff generally aren't included in the uh  in the uh U S R returns 

Right Rachel wou how would you feel if you 'd done all the analysis for this questionnaire

Would you be interested in coming to the meeting 

Uhm

Oh I 'd certainly find something that would be quite sort of valid about it sort of like 

I don't know if there 's any   

I mean

Well perhaps we can sort that out later then   

Right

Are there any other matters arising 

uhm

Oh seeing Patrick 's reminded me actually

Uhm the Institute of Orthopaedics was mentioned at our last meeting and we had a brief discussion at the Faculty of Clinical Sciences Board 

And I understand that that working party report that academic audit is only supposed to be the draft

Yeah 

Well they 've already made one 

Anyway what was said was that that report shouldn't have been so widely distributed because it was only a draft document 

But anyway it 's going to be discussed again at the next faculty board meeting in Clinical Sciences 

But that probably means  by mistake on this occasion didn't you

Well that 's good 

Right

Salaries 

I can tell you 're waking up there 

Now  with the papers to this meeting if you burrowed down to that near the bottom you will see the letter that came today to headquarters L A four four three one about the Special Meeting of Council which is going to be held in London on the thirty-first of October

And I also have here the uhm all the stuff for those people who who are going

Sort of badges and voting cards and what have you

So it 's going to be at uhm eleven o'clock

And it 's the International Students ' House opposite Great Portland Street

so it 's within walking distance of here

And uh it will finish before four o'clock in the afternoon 

So we have to decide who is going

And we have to decide if we are going to propose any amendments to the Executive motions  or a separate motion from U C A U T

We have to do it today so we can get anythi get it on the agenda to go round t to everybody 

No we can't

We 're too late 

I 'm thinking aloud 

Yes

Well I uhm when I was deciding on the date for the general meeting I I consulted  one or two people including Barbara and Ruth and Rachel

And we decided it was much better to have the general meeting 's report on what happened at at the Special Council rather than trying to get people before and after 

So if we are going to put anything up we haven't got time to send it round to everybody unfortunately but I suppose we can put something up if it 's in line with other motions that the branch has passed 

Now did anybody have anything

You one or two people look as though they have

Why

Yes 

We have modified a previous motion uhm





Have you got anything in writing

Yes



Right 





This is very similar to 

Hold on

Was this discussed at May Council



Discussed at Sheffield

W was that December



Yeah

That 's all right then because you

Yeah

Well we should be out o out in time for it

That 's right because i i in the last Council meeting it would have been out of order to bring up the same thing on successive meetings

Yeah

It 's an emergency motion like for changed circumstances 

I 'm sure you 'd go along with that

We thank you executive member 

OK

We 'll put it mixed-up bill 

Not really

It 's a cra crazy idea

It won't go through but 







Can I ask why you suggested the membership should be elected by local associations rather than by council 





three-or-four-words are elected by Council

I think there is a case to be made for it however and that is the uhm the the the thinking behind this in the first instance was to actually involve as many people

I mean y you can't have everybody on on any sort of committee but you can involve as many people as possible in terms of propagandising around the place uh  informing people as to what the issues are  when the elections are coming up 

Uhm

I 'm just uhm I 'm just thinking of what happens in other elections which the membership 

Yes

I appreciate that it 's full of problems but uh 

Uhm well be before we get into the detailed discussion of all of this have you got something else Marj

I 've got an amendment to uhm executive motion one which I 'm afraid I did in about five minutes and there 's a typo in it

Oh yeah but we 've got something in print 

Uhm  I would like to have proposed a motion to take industrial action generally about the pay claim but in view of it not being able to go to the General Meeting I think this is in line with our  local policy 

Yes

So this would follow  the executive motion which says Council resolves it then

Following the summary offer made by the U O P to A U T any informal committee over the eleventh of July nineteen eighty-one is unacceptable

Uhm

And thank you again Bob very very much for your year of office

It 's all been so efficiently organised and uh



Well the surface is what shows   

but uh  it 's been splendid

and very many thanks

Uhm  Denis can we have your report which I trust won't be too deeply technical

No after two long reports we 've got a very short one  

First we 've got this uh the format  of the accounts which goes to me 

Now this the old way of doing things

These are the only accounts  for nine months 

We had an excellent three months before this started which was really only the beginning of the Society when we had sixty members all paying a pound apiece

We had certain outgoings secretarial and we ended up with thirty-five pounds which you see is brought forward on the left-hand side

Now you can summarize this year by saying 

at the time thirty-first of December we had ninety-six people who paid up out of the hundred and ten 

One or two haven't actually paid yet but never mind

we 'll forget that one





 uh so there was a hundred and thirty-two pounds  from members but union grants came to a hundred and three pounds  which was quite useful

so  we had a total income of three hundred and thirty 

Lost a little on functions  uh

that was mainly for wines and the other the  A G M matters

Through the year we did seem to sort of

we struggled

we paid for

Uh  secretarial came out at sixteen pounds

sixty-one pounds for publicity which w I think was well worthwhile 

There 's no doubt about that

it was uh in my view the best

I usually think that advertising and publicity is a complete and utter waste of money but in a university it does mean a lot and I think part of our success has been the publicity and the timing of the publicity

Mmm

I 'll say something about that after the report yeah

The report uhm

the continuation with the What 's On was useful 

So we end up with a balance at the end of the year of two hundred and five which was quite a healthy situation and in spite of last night 's Pig and Whistle we got that money still in hand 

I think that 's the end of it

Any queries



Uh Ted altered it before

we had eighty-eight pounds since 

Thank you





That 's down here



Yes







What

Mmm

But I think there 's scope for the extra members being attracted

Mmm



But we had  hard core members and the extra people paid for a while

That 's as I saw it



We 're going to run into difficulties now because we 've already got to ten to two 

Is there a class in here afterwards



If you need to go then just go

We understand

Can we approve the accounts

How many of you approve the accounts

Yes approved yes

Thank you

And thank you very much again on behalf of all of us  for your uh  tremendous amount of background work you do so steadily  which saves us all having to think about it

Can I make two important points about losing money on functions

First of all I don't mind I don't know how to I don't mind losing money on functions and wine and things 

I think it 's I think it 's a nice gesture subsidised

Uh I don't expect to make a profit

I get to try all the wines at Tesco 's as a result

Uhm I think it 's nice for people to have it here

Uhm they pay their two pounds membership and I think that 's fine

I think it 's nice to see some of that membership money ploughed back in

And second it 's membership publicity

I think it 's so important

So many people come along because they 've seen what 's been going on in the back of What 's On  and I definitely think that that should be carried on because people do read it they do respond to it they do take action on it

so that 's definitely well worth the money 

And it 's very good plus very good idea actually  last year

It 's worked so well



Uhm  is fourteen pounds nine uhm  which  one of the things about with uh he 's uh  competition on that then and uh it it 's in the ballroom it 's  been it 's been it 's been basically approved with the What 's On in the past

Yeah

Yes

Yes

Uhm  questions to officers 

In fact we 've been asking questions all the way through



Yeah quite 



Now then election of officers and committee for nineteen two nine nineteen ninety-two ninety-three 

Uh  we may conceivably run into trouble here 

I wonder if we could uh  uh somebody would please propose for Treasurer to start with 



I propose Denis  to carry on as Treasurer if he 'll be as happy and able to do it

With friends like you I don't need enemies 

 thank you very much uh 

Well as the Treasurer Denis has been uhm proposed and seconded  and I move that we will uhm  to agree

Any other nominations



Well we uhm

Is that Jane Warren



You said Jane Weaver

I thought it was Weaver because

Maybe it is Warren just 

Bob when was that 



Last week

Oh fine

Spoke to her



OK



Yes



Uh so it 's Jane Weaver not Jane Warren

She 's doing Psychology  tall slim dark hair

Has it in a plait 

Uhm yes

I 'll put in the description down and not the name 

This is running away with me

We haven't in fact confirmed that we have re-elected Denis as Treasurer



Can I formally do that

When I said were there any other nominations I meant for Treasurer



Uhm  well  now then perhaps we should come to Secretary next

I 'm deliberately taking this out of order because we have got a nomination for Secretary and uh and and Jane has agreed to take on the  has she not but she couldn't be here today

I know



And  and so I wonder uh has she picked 



Jane

Has she been proposed and seconded





We have to have these things done properly







Are we all agreed that in the absence of any other nominations that Jane Weaver should be our new Secretary 

I shall approve of that

Excellent she has proposed herself or at least uh 



Have we got any nominations for President



No  there 's one there 's one girl friend friend of Jane who we thought probably would would be good for that post

Unfortunately she 's neither contacted myself nor Bob  to say yea or nay 

So I think we 're going to have to leave that one in abeyance actually 

I don't know if anybo anybody

Does anybody else feel they could take on the role of President or uh feel somebody they know would they 'd like to nominate 

Mmm it would take up the time but yes

Uhm 



Ted

Is there anybody here who feels they would be they might be willing to take on that job 

Well that 's I suppose uh uh

What

are we expected

  

Uhm

this is actually very worrying because if you think that I 've got  three officers to run the society I mean we really are not viable

We can't possibly just throw the whole society at Jane  and Denis  uhm 

and  I mean I think that  we can leave it in abeyance

but that 's  a very serious step to take

and  who is going to  help and direct them





Can we call a special meeting or something 

Maybe just that it 's this week that uhm there aren't enough people around

Uhm

This week is difficult because it is Reading Week 

Uhm particular individuals who might might be eligible 

I don't know

I 'll ask around

I think we must we must try and schedule this for next week mustn't we



Right

Uhm

When 's the normal handover date



Actually Monday I feel that instead of lunch we could have a special meeting on this 

Well that 's right I mean I I think we shall just have to declare that every meeting from now on until a President has been found is in effect a sort of extraordinary general meeting   and uh as we haven't got a written constitution your wish that uh uh as soon as uh a nomination appears uh that whatever meeting that nomination is publicised at shall be considered to be an extension of this meeting  uh ex officio

Is that does that suit people

you know if we haven't got



Ex officio

It 's a practical point



Mmm

In that case that that 's how we shall have to leave it

and w what we don't want is that there should be nobody attending any more Thursday lunchtime meetings for the rest of the term 

 and uh we will have to  work quite hard on people

so 

I mean Chris actually  didn't rush into our arms last year and say yes yes yes

I 'm sorry

I 've been really dying to say this 





I was terrified

I was terrified





Uhm people have to be asked

that 's the point that they 've got to take the job on

You were very diffident about it right at the beginning

and you 've done an absolutely splendid job and and grown with it 

and somebody else will do the same 

but we 've just got to uhm twist a few arms more 

Oh thank you

I mean I do know that it does take up time and I do feel that I have to be there for every activity that I set up and I think that 's probably right I think 

Uhm I don't think I can just not turn up for things but set them up

Uh I think you do need that kind of commitment and I you know you do need to know who your members are

And I think that 's all you need really just just

just wanting to be there

and just

I mean for me it 's like another extension of me going out to have a good gas 

so that that 's that that has been of great benefit to me

Although I would actually say

I think it would be nice for the person who takes it on cos I think it 's a great way of representing the college in another facet altogether

I think that has been really important really valuable

That 's true

Well what 's been useful is Bob 's contact with the Union

Yeah

Yeah he 's been a great help there

That 's a hidden asset we 've had  

Well hopefully he will guide our new secretary into into the contacts there so uhm



I mean David  he was a great uh good speaker wasn't he 

Uh I mean that 's





Let 's just get on now to section D  and item number seven which is the five committee places which we do desperately need more people to help run this society because this is one reason why people won't take on the main jobs because they they are too big for people who 've already got heavy commitments

And most mature students are in fact rather more dedicated to their work or find it takes longer or find that they can't stay up till late at night doing it when some go down to the





Well it is true yes

That 's right

They perceive themselves as that being their problem uhm 

and really half an hour a week would probably take care of a lot of these finicky jobs 

Uhm I mean it 's not that we go to the theatre every week

If somebody would be prepared to organise it once a term that would be  splendid

Everybody can make informal arrangements for other times uhm  so that I think that is something that shouldn't be too frightening and would bring in a few more helpers

OK 

End of term Easter party yeah 

Uh we will be having uh I think

I think we should get the Easter bunny back 

Yeah

Mm mmm

No voting for Social Sec for the Easter bunny 

Well when are social s secretary elections

I know that it 's a sort of bunny style

Yeah

Is Mich is Michelle in here



It 's traditional though

I think she should be the Easter bunny or

Andy would make a really nice Easter bunny

Or  or let 's think

Paul 

I think we should have Paul

Paul yeah

I think I I think Katherine would make a good Easter bunny

No I would not

Yeah

Yeah

Andy yeah

Yeah

Andy

Yeah

I think you would make a very good Easter bunny

Shall we have a vote

Let 's be dem democratic

All right all right 

All right all right

Hang on hang on hang on

Andy

Andy

Andy

Andy as Easter bunny

Easter bunny

No not me

I 'm

Can we have a vote whether Andy should be Easter bunny

All right

All right

I think what we ought to do here  is we ought to have nominations 

Now I am going to nominate Katherine

You 'll get a chance to speak in a minute

I 'll second that then yeah

Carol seconds Katherine

You vote for me and I 'll

Does anyone else want to be nominated

Shall we nominate anyone else

I will not be held to 

Yeah Andy

Not me

Yeah

No I 'm busy

Andy Andy has been nominated

I 'll be busy

You can be busy in an Easter bunny outfit

No I will be really busy that night

It 'll be it 'd just be far too hectic

Anyway so  uhm  who else can we nominate 

Natasha

No she 's done it before 

Katherine Thompson

No

Hiding down there

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah

Yeah

So this is battle of the Katherines yeah

Does en

Joe would you like to nominate Katherine

I would indeed

Right 

OK

Emma do you want to second that

Yeah why not

Right

OK 

What we 're going to have now are speeches

The m  the object of the speeches is  yeah you have to convince why you should not do it

Whoever 's most convincing doesn't have to do it

So first speech from Katherine Thompson

Come on 

It entails dressing up as an Easter bunny and wandering round giving away free uhm  Cadbury 's Creme Eggs

What exactly do I have to wear

A bunny costume 

A full bunny costume yeah

Not like not like Playboy bunnies  right

It 's like a nightmare you can't return from



Yeah

Just a big furry cuddly bunny

Exceedingly exceedingly hot this costume



What do you mean hot

As in hot as in hot

Like fur



They 're really hot

And you can't breathe and you can't smoke unless you smoke through the nose

Right

Where 's your speech 

What you have to do is you have to dress up as an Easter bunny

and you have to wander round giving away free Cadbury 's Creme Eggs 

I wouldn't be very good at giving them away though

Well you just sit on



You think you think you 'd eat them all

I think I 'd eat them all yeah

You 'd be sick down your bunny costume

Yeah 

Yeah that 's quite bad

Well all right

Why shouldn't you be the Easter bunny

Yeah

Cos I just can't Andy

I have like too much on you know

We can get we can get you a blue bunny costume 

No no no

Cos it 

Yeah OK

All right

So

It doesn't work Andy

I can't

Do we want  this Katherine or that Katherine

Yeah

Yeah

Katherine you 're the Easter bunny

It 's a living nightmare

you know that

That 's right

That 's right

OK that 's good 

So we 've got one bit sorted out

Also we 're going to have a Cadbury 's Creme Egg-eating competition at some point 

Uhm  a band 

I think we need a band

A band

The only band I can think of that will have across the board appeal  is Death Bang Party

Now we can get them back

Yeah

What about 

They 'd be good for a

Yeah that 

You haven't heard them

Would they do it

I 'm sure they 'd do it  yeah 

We had them last night at the Windeyer

They played last night at the Windeyer

Yeah it went down really well 

What do you reckon

Random Groove Movement

Won't cost us anything to have them

All right 

Random Groove Movement last Thursday of term 

And what date is the Easter party

Uhm the last Thursday of term is the twenty-sixth of June 

Wait

hang on

No

No

twenty-sixth of whatever this month is

March

Twenty-sixth of March

Going crazy

Yeah twenty-sixth of March  OK 

Good 

Uhm  so what have we got

We 've got a band

Could we have an indie disco on the third floor

We 'll do a disco on the third floor 

We 've got the bunny

We 've got the competition and we 'll be

We might have the bunny if I turn up

What 's the competition

We 've got the bunny

What 's the competition Andy

And we 'll

An Eas a Cadbury 's Creme Egg-eating competition 

Uhm  actually I think

Oh actually tonight 's endurance

I think Carol ought to leave at this point because you 're probably taking part

So you can come back in a minute

Go on

I 'm going to I 'm going to go through this 

Right have we all got any uhm any more candidates in here

Right tonight uhm

We normally get them to down pints but we had complaints from girls that competed last year that said it 's too much

So tonight we 're kicking off with a double tequila slammer  a tablespoonful of salt 

No no sorry I 've got that wrong

It 's three dry cream crackers followed by a tablespoonful of salt then a double tequila slammer then the treacle down the underwear  then one large onion followed by the maggots in the doughnuts followed by another double slammer followed by a bulb of garlic followed by a couple of green chillies  

Then we 've got a double tequila slammer again

Why don't you have some Guinness

Yeah but they 're 

Guinness

Yeah yeah

Let 's go

Right what we need now

Is something going to be going on as well as eating

Yeah this is it

We need a large kind of like psychological finale 



After all that

There will be people left after this

Seriously

We 're going to have between eight and ten competitors

you would eat maggots 

There has to be something something really really really gross but psychological 



Too easy

Too easy

We want something that

Have we got any chainsaws

We w we want something that 's going to be sort of like instil a little bit of fear at this point

 headstands

Headstands but you can't 

Hide headstands 

Cartwheels

What you could do is you could use uh

There 's not enough space 

Andy you could mix uh milk and like uh uh uh and vodka uhm you know instead of one of those tequila slammers because that 's absolutely vile cos it all separates

I think

And then slip in the sick

What like white Russian

Yeah well it all separates

You get a whole load of 

What milk and vodka

Milk and vodka

Mmm

If you do it with Pimms and milk it looks like snot though

Does it uh separate with just fresh milk

Yeah 

Cos I thought a white a white Russian doesn't separate does it 

Well

Try it

We 'll try it







It must have been off then

Yeah

It would it wouldn't separate 

Wouldn't it

No it wouldn't

No

Uhm  we need a finale something really nasty

What can we do

Why not make them snog each other 

Yeah

snog tongues and everything

That would be

Yes

Yeah

Yes that 'd be so bad

Cos they all will have vomited by this stage

That 'd be disgusting

That would be even better

Passing something between their mouths

Drink the vomit and then snog each other

Snog each other

Oh that 's really horrible

Or like pass cubes of ice around around the uhm by mouth around the group or something

OK

Oi oi do you want are you ready

You want to make it really horrible

Get a bucket

Whoever chucks up chucks into the buck bucket

and at the end

No you can't make people drink it

I I I I think we we we should we should get into this personal contact sort of thing

Try some maggots

They 've got to

 you 've got to take turns blowing a a bubble with the same piece of bubble gum and and pass it on mouth to mouth 

But they 'd probably all do that after all that kind of shit

Or what about they have to do something really nasty to each other or

or swapping clothes or something

Pass a maggot from mouth to mouth

When you 've got it in your mouth you have to put it in your nose 

You what

And then get it out of the other person 's nose 

So so what

Well hang on

So what we want to do is pass a mouthful of maggots from mouth to mouth

No 

Uhm all right we won't do that one 

What are we going to do

What are we going to do

Henry what are you doing tonight  



No I want you to compere 

I 've I 've 

All right you compere yeah

May as well

Uhm

How about pouring a pint of oil over their heads or something

We we want something we want s we want something that they really really really don't want to do

Right

Andy

Andy  uhm maggots OK

Show the maggots to them

blindfold them

then get uhm

change it

get some jellytots or something like that

I know

Yeah 

No but we did that with the doughnuts

The maggots go in the doughnuts

Yeah well Andy

No but they think they 've got maggots 

Right

We 've got a suggestion here yeah 

Basically you tie the hands of the contestants behind their back  and you have to you get an object and it 's either down the trousers or down the cleavage or something and the other contestant has to get it out without using their hands



Oh God

Yeah

Don't think many people will go for that Andy

I don I think people might go for it

I think they 'd do 

Down the trousers



It would look quite funny though

But  for a finale it 's got to be something quite 



We want something psychological

We want to fuck some heads up 

Yeah 



No

No

No

Come on

What can we do

I think they 'll be really pissed by this stage 

That 's like more of a party game isn't it

Yeah

Well we 've got a few vindictive people here 

They have to drink a pint of magic mushrooms

Yeah does it have to be legal 

No w we

it 'd be nice if we could avoid an eating or drinking type thing

now

Right OK

So you were with us before

Yes

So you 've had a policy

Yes

I had a policy

Right 

You don't know the number though

No

I don't

Right 

It 's just run out on the car 

Is it a different car or the same car or

Eh no a different car

A Renault Five 

It was a Citroen  Four 

What 's your surname

Mm

What 's your surname

Eh name

Shall I write it down for you

Ah yeah

Maybe write it 

My initial 's J 

It 's a pity you haven't got your policy number actually cos this is going to be a wee bit hard to find with this surname

I don't know quite how we 're going to how we 'll put it in on the computer 

What what what difference does that make

Well it 's it 's going to save us a hell of a lot of time because we can take all the details off the computer 

It 's already on there

Yeah that 'd be a good idea because I haven't got  uhm no

Saves you going through it all again 

What was your last address 

I think it was eighty-nine ninety 

I don't know whether I had it in eighty-nine

Mmm ninety

It must definitely must have been on ninety

And what was the address at the time

Uhm that must have been

Mmm

Yah

That would have happened after moving to Oxford

Stratford  in Osborne Road

More spec more specific

I mean street and

Osborne Road 

hundred and

Was it flat nine 

Two A 

Uhm flat nine twenty-two St James 's Square

Oh yeah that 's from the that 's the first one

OK that 's the right that 's the old one 



Damn

I knew I was going to pick the wrong one there 

I still have that as my permanent address though because it 's my my mother 's place 

So I guess it wouldn't have to be changed 

Where I live now I 'm probably only staying for the rest of the term 

So what 's your current address

Uhm

I think I 'd best just just leave it because I 'm only going to stay in it for three months

By the t end of term I 'm leaving  and that 's my mother 's place and I usually get my mail there once a week

Right

But where are you actually going to be keeping the car

Uhm  just keep it under that address

That 'll do fine

 Well I mean I 'm I 'm doing this for your own protection

I mean obviously I 'm not too happy with that answer 

That means you 're not keeping it there but you 'd rather do it for simplicity 's sake

Is that what you 're actually saying

Mm

I need to know exactly where the car is going to be 

Postcode

Oh OK I see

That 's in

We can use we can use your mother 's address

That 's fine

I 'm quite happy to use your mother 's address but we need to know where the car 's going to be

Right 

One  one five nine Maldon Street in Bow

Right so that 's E

Three

E three

Two D A

And

Right

And your mother 's address is

Twenty-two St James 's Square  flat nine 

That 's London  N nine

did you say

No

That 's S W one

S W one 

Right

And it 's flat nine 

Oh right 

Right OK and

The thing is because they never send back all mail from these college places

so it 's rather inconvenient 

Right

How many drivers do you want on this

Two

Two 

Including yourself

Including myself

Yes

Right 

And your age is

Twenty-five

Twenty-five 

Twenty-six isn't it

No

Twenty-five

Sixty-seven I was born

Oh we put you down as sixty-five 

OK

Have you got a full British licence

or is there 

I 've got an international and a European  or the German or whatever

International 

And  your occupation is 

Student

Student 

No accidents claims convictions

No

Who is the second driver



Right

So if we haven't got  for her or

So is that male or female

That 's the one here

Mmm 



D' you know his age

Mm

D' you know his age

Uhm twenty  eight or twenty-nine

Twenty-eight 

uh twenty-eight

It 's twenty-eight

And this is and this is presumably an international licence 

How long has he lived in this country

Two years 

two and a half years

And his occupation

He 's a student 

And no accidents  claims convictions 

Right well 

No

What 's the car

It 's a Renault Five

Renault Five 

And the engine size 

Is 

I wrote that down  nine five six cc

And the year 

The year it was built uhm 

It 's fourteen years old

Mmm 

Can I have a quick look at this 

No

I haven't got it written down

Oh

That 's all right 

That 's the 

That 's my brother 's so

That 's a W right 

Nineteen eighty-one 

That 's that is when you say it 's fourteen years old I mean that 's the registration plate

Is that the original registration plate or has it been changed

No

It hasn't been changed so far as I know

Right

So it 's nineteen eighty-one right 

And did you want third party fire and theft or 

Do I want what

Third party fire and theft or third party only

Third party  and theft of 

I don't own that car

so I don't want that

Third party only

Right so third party only

Third party 

What else can you have

Comprehensive

No no

Not worthwhile

Uh 

Do you know what the car is worth  roughly 

I haven't a clue

We 've had it in our family all that time so I don't really know 

I guess something like four hundred five hundred pounds

OK 

This student plan special insurance would that cover a computer and a bicycle

Uh it would cover a computer but not a bicycle 

Right OK

For both of you to drive it would be two hundred and forty-three pounds  for the year

I 'd like to have it for half a year if possible

You 'd like to have

Half a year

Half a year 

OK 

It 's not a very cost effective way of doing it mind you

Why

Well it doesn't cost you half the amount

It costs you a lot more than half the amount

Which is

Well  a hundred and thirty-one fifty

A hundred and  thirty-one  fifty

Thirty-one fifty

That 's not too

And for the year

Two hundred and  forty isn't it

Yeah

So it 's not too bad

Yeah

I think I 'd probably do the half year though because I don't know how long it will be on the road that car

OK 

Uh if I can't if I have another car I could have it run on the same insurance only if it has the same engine size right

Aah no

You have to have a totally different insurance

No

Half a year

OK 

So do you want to go ahead with that now

Mhm

Yeah

That 's fine

Right 

OK

Fill that in for me  uhm

and I 'll take you through that 

Have you a pen

Thank you

I can do that here right

Yeah

Title 

The permanent

I can put there my mother 's right

Yeah 

OK 

And initials

H

H 

What 's your address

Fifty-seven St Edmund 's Drive  Stanmore 

The one you did last time was for my wife actually  which was F name 

That probably explains why I can't find it under H 

Right 

People always say that about ten minutes after you 've looked under their real name

Yeah

Well it was for me but then you said you advised me that it was better to put it in her name cos it would be cheaper 

Yeah

F for Freddie

Yeah 

I definitely did something with this but I don't know what 

You sent us some stuff then  literature on house insurance or something

Oh did I

Oh yeah 

H  

Right

So what 's what 's the new situation then

Well  it 's just that I 'm probably going to  give up my there 's a possibility of giving up my car  and taking on my dad 's

Right

He 's going to give it to me

And is this totally different from the Escort or is this the same

This is totally different from the Escort 

Cos we 're now just going to have one car and one insurance

Right

so there 's

Right

So we 're scrapping the Escort

so forget about that one

Right

So the insurance will probably be in my name  cos I 've got  I 've got all the no claims bonus and I 've got protective discount

Right

OK 

Or the cheapest way

I don't know if it would be cheaper to do it in her name

but I don't think

No

Not if

not if we 're using your no claims bonus 

I 've actually had the full no claims bonus  for five years

And for three years I 've been given the option to protect her

Protect her right  OK

No

It 's seven and five not five and three

Seven and five 

It 's amazing when you think back

I can remember my driving test

I 've been driving for  thirteen years 

Right

So it 's still H A Severn 

And what 's the car going to be

Yeah

Uh it 's a Mercedes Two Twenty  automatic 

And the year

Uh seventy-four

M registration

And the value

Well the nominal value you put on it was five thousand

OK

I guess it 's getting more into the  kind of collector 's 

You 're aged thirty-two

Yeah

Yeah

And you 've got about eight years no claims 

Right

Let 's see what comes up 

Do you know what the exact c c is for the two one nine

Uh yeah

It 's something like that

Two one nine yeah uh 

Well fully comprehensive

If you 're the main driver with  uh eight years no claims bonus or thereabouts  we can you can have a two hundred and fifty pounds  without protection or two hundred and eighty-five fifty with protection

Are you sure about that

Absolutely positive 

Would I lie to you 

Cos my dad who 's got a much better history than me

Mind you he 's got I suppose he 's got four cars under his name

It 's an old car

Mm

It 's an old car

Yeah

But the value is fi you put it as for five thousand whereas uh

I 'm not all that worried 

Values I mean value doesn't affect the price of the insurance

It 's the age  so

Two hundred and eighty-five with protected discount

Yeah

Now in theory and this is just

I don't want you to punch anything else into the computer

but I mean just off the top of your head  if we were jammy enough which we won't be but if we were jammy enough to keep the Mercedes  which I would be the main if you like you could put it down as the only driver of  and we carried on keeping the Escort as well 

and we s and we insured with you would that still be the rough would she still have to pay two fifty-nine on that

Mm

Yeah

Right

Mhm

Yeah we could still

I mean the  the whole point of the of the other quote was that  that was your wife being the main user  with uhm with uhm when we gave her the three years ' discount cos you had the maximum

So it still applies

So it 's totally different  kettle of fish

Separate

Yeah  OK

That 's unbelievable

That is really good just cos I mean he said that it would be around about eight hundred pounds

No 

I mean the value  five thousand is quite high  the value for a seventy-four car uhm  but  as I say the value is not really a consideration

It 's the age

so they go on they 're based on the age

Right

It 's  has it been done up at all

or is it just

No

Not really

It 's just been I mean it 's been kept in good condition

and you know it 's very

He won't he won't sell it

There 's no way he 'll part with it

I mean he only let me have it cos it 's me

I mean he won't  if you see what I mean 

Two hundred and eighty pounds if I protected it

Yeah

That is really good that is

I just can't believe that

Yeah

It 's not a surprise

You 're both over thirty and it 's uh an old car

And you 're also in a good postcode as well so 

And it 's off-road  parking as well

Yeah

So a real test for England now then 

Graham Taylor has been saying the England manager that this is perhaps the toughest test that  he and his team have faced in his seven internationals so far

This is Graham Taylor 's seventh international  and uh in charge of the side and certainly it looks that way

They 're a goal down and Michalichenko again comes forward with his left foot

Plays it square to  Kolivanov

and left-footed he tries a long one

Well that will go well wide

Chris Woods watches it

but no doubt Kolivanov uh probably then  that the England defence just for a moment will be a little unsettled after that goal

and it was probably worth a try









The play has switched to the other end and England have won their fourth corner which Denis Wise will take 

A neat ball from  John Barnes it was but Ian Wright in the corner comes across

Headed back out to Wise

Wise plays it in

feeds it to Derigo this time

He moves forward

back it goes to Wise

He 's on the corner of the box

Right footed early

Cross to the far post

Not quite clear

And in comes Geoff Thomas

Well he hammered it

He had to hit it early because uh Kuznecov it was was coming in with a with a quick tackle 

but the Crystal Palace midfield player has hit it with his right foot which isn't his better foot either

and it 's gone high and wide into the crowd away to our right

Goal kick to the Soviet Union









Michalichenko  gives it away to John Barnes

Barnes to Platt

Platt left-footed tries a drive from twenty-five yards

That too may be a little optimistic

but England prepared to shoot on sight

That too has gone high over the crossbar for another  goal kick to the Soviet Union

but that was a bad ball from uh Michalichenko  who now plays his football in Italy of course for Sampdoria who 've just won the Italian league championship with a win three nil win over Lecce on  Sunday

So  the new Italian champions and Michalichenko in midfield very much the the general both for his club and his country

but that was a bad ball which  rather gave it away gave it away to John Barnes

and it put Platt in for the shot 

Ball back in  deep inside the Soviet half

and again Michalichenko left-footed switches the play to the far side to Kanchelskis who comes infield 

Again lots of support for the  Soviet side as they build up through

Kulkov this time was prepared to go forward

Ball played forward aimed for Kanchelskis who 's made a run this time through the middle

but that was always too far in front of him

and it was Derigo who came across did the covering job and then switched the play to his fellow full back Stevens who moves it upfield to Ian Wright

He tries to get a a header back infield for Allan Smith but Michalichenko was there well before him

He 's played it back to Svaba the sweeper and he plays it again square across his own eighteen yard line and eventually inevitably it goes back to Michalichenko

Left-footed

Sweeps it out to the far right 

Easy interception though for  Tony Derigo the left back the England left back

and he finds John Barnes

Barnes holds it with his left foot and then plays it square to Mark Wright the unfortunate  scorer of the own goal the goal which separates the sides at the moment

Right-footed

Sweeps it long

Well that was a lovely ball by Mark Wright

He picked out Allan Smith  who had to stretch for it  deep inside the area on the far side about ten yards inside the area about five yards from the by-line

It was just a little too strong for Allan Smith but he acknowledged the the quality of the pass from Mark Wright

Couldn't quite control it

And again it 's a goal kick to the Soviet Union





Ray Clemence





Well they 're a goal down at the moment 

England nil

Soviet Union one

and it 's Mark Wright again halfway inside his own half

This time plays it square onto the halfway line to  Derigo

Derigo manages to get the ball upfield

A little deflection off one of the Soviet players on the far side

and a a throw goes to England

Taken a little too hurriedly though by Allan Smith

I think

He played in field to John Barnes and got a knock in his knee for his trouble

And it was uh  I 've got a feeling that it was  Kanchelskis who was involved in the tackle because he came across and just gave John Barnes a little pat to acknowledge the fact that it was an a accident

And again the Soviet Union can start to build deep from the back

and they really do start their attacks right along the back four and then suddenly explode in the  middle third and final third

but England pick it up this time

and Ian Wright tries to play it down the right-hand side

Michalichenko gets a left foot to it

Plays it over the touch line just down in front of us

England playing from left to right 

We are high in our gantry position  above the main stand here at  Wembley

and the throw taken by Gary Stevens of Rangers

Up to Ian Wright

Played back untidily by Wright though

and again the Soviet Union can gain possession

but in fact England win a free kick

Gary Stevens it was who came forward

and the tackle by Galiamin was  adjudged by the referee to to be a foul

and so England have a free kick halfway inside the Soviet half

That 's the half  to our right  and it will be Paul Parker  who will take it wearing the number five the Queens Park Rangers  player

There was speculation that he could be on the move from Queen 's Park Rangers 

Long cross aimed for Mark Wright

Played back in

and a goal for England

Allan Smith it is  who 's got it

The ball swung flat hard and low across the area and Allan Smith of Arsenal has got his first goal for England an equaliser

It wasn't cleared properly by by the Soviet defence

A little flick by Allan Smith

Very neatly done as he 's been doing all season for Arsenal

So England get an equaliser

England one Soviet Union one











Well twenty-seven goals Allan Smith has scored for Arsenal this season or scored for Arsenal during the season but that in his sixth international is his first for England

So an equaliser equalising the own goal by Mark Wright though Tadzachuk will no doubt claim it for the Soviet Union

scored after nine minutes

One all then

and everything now all square and to play for again as the Soviet Union this time attack

Down the left Tadzachuk

This time bowled over

Referee waves play on

England have the possession

John Barnes just approaching the centre circle

Leaves it for Geoff Thomas who plays it square to Derigo on the far left

Derigo plays it back to Thomas just on the halfway line

Now just clips it forward

Smith meets it

Gets it down dangerously

Half cleared only as far as Stevens

He 'll sustain the England attack

Plays it to Denis Wise on the right

Plays it back to Stevens again

He 's got a little space

Plays it square infield to Parker who 's pushed forward

Everyone inside the Soviet half  to our right

Direction switched again to Derigo

Goes past one man

Goes past a second

Finds Smith who lays it off neatly to Barnes

Now then Barnes comes inside on his right foot

Waits twists turns feigns to play to the left

Chips it nicely nicely to Platt on the far side

Driven in low by Derigo

Cleared again

A corner to England their fifth of the game so far

Good run by Tony Derigo down the left-hand side overlapping beautifully found by Barnes









Wise with a corner

England 's fifth

Aimed for the near post

Headed firmly away by Chernishkov this time

Only back as far as Wise though

Comes inside his man neatly on the corner of the area

Right footed

Aimed for the far post

A little too strong for everyone

And uh Kuznecov watched it just drift over his head

And it 's gone behind away to our right for a goal kick to the Soviet Union



Well this is the eleventh meeting between the two countries

England have won four the Soviet Union three with three drawn

The last meeting was in the European championships in nineteen eighty-eight when the Soviet Union on that occasion won by three goals to one but both sides in the process really of rebuilding

The Soviet Union especially

Their last game a very good win in uh European Group Three against Hungary in Budapest 

But uh this is very much a new Soviet side

Shalimov on the left finds Michalichenko the one man who really does have enormous experience 

Thirtieth cap tonight for him and he gets it back this time to Svaba the sweeper

Neatly done again

Into midfield it goes to Kukov

Plays it wide to the right

The very patient Soviet build-up

Back it goes to Galiamin

Along the back four yet again to Svaba who 's the back man

Switches the direction to Chernishkov this time

Tall dark hair slim

Plays it back again to the sweeper

Played into the midfield this time to Kuznecov who meets it

Just filters it forward a little to Michalichenko

He tries a long ball

In comes Derigo

Intercepts it well in front of Kadzachuk and heads it back to Chris Woods who at the moment isn't having too many touches

Still I 'm sure thinking about that own goal completely wrong-footed the England goalkeeper

No blame attached to him

It really was a simple goal in the end as it just  rolled across the England line to give the Soviet Union the lead after just nine minutes but then came Allan Smith 's equaliser

At the moment the Soviet Union have a throw-in level with their own area on the far side 

Twenty-one minutes gone

England one Soviet Union one 

And remember the Soviet Union play Argentina at Old Trafford on Thursday and then England will meet Argentina here again at Wembley on Saturday 

The Soviet Union have possession in the  centre circle

Kuznecov tried to play it forward

That wasn't a good pass to Tatachuk that time

Again the England defence can do the mopping up and again it 's back with Chris Woods  back in the England goal after missing the last three internationals 

David Seaman of course took over from him

Well Woods has a chance again to re-establish himself  as Barnes has possession for England

Plays it square to Parker

Rather plays him into trouble and Michalichenko can win it but then uh a misunderstanding as Michalichenko tried to play it square 

And  it 's England again

Stevens this time plays an early one forward

Barnes nips in and wins it well

Takes on the Soviet defence

Goes past one

Can't  beat a second and the ball is played over the touchline level with the Soviet area

Throw-in taken quickly by Wise to Barnes

Gets it back to Wise

Early cross from him

Smitts rises  manages to head it down

Simple one for the goalkeeper though

But a good England attack









Free kick to the Soviet Union half way inside the England half

Kanchelskis was the man brought down

Played quickly to Michalichenko

A little too quickly perhaps

Denis Wise nips in for the interception

Can't retain the possession for England though and it 's Turneskov who plays it forward

Then out on the left it goes to Shalimov

He plays it infield again to Michalichenko really the hub of all the Soviet attacks

He plays it square to  Snabor Svaba

Helps it out to the far right

Lots of movement up front now as the Soviet Union come forward again

Michalichenko changes the direction to the far side

Little touch from  Tatachuk 

Gets it wide to the right

Tatachuk makes the run on the outside

Receives it  level with the area

Finds Kanchelskis who then manages to get past his man into the area

This is real danger

Across it comes

Parker makes an important interception as the ball was  hit hard and low across the England goal and then some lovely play by John Barnes

Half-time in Paris

Fourteen points to three

France leading against Wales here

No score as the ball 's won at the back of the line-out but the referee says bit of pushing in the middle 

And it 'll be a penalty kick to England 

Carling calls for the ball inside his own half

gives it to Andrew

And he 'll hopefully kick this up for England towards the Irish twenty-two

It 's a long kick

Has he found touch

Oh it 's a superb kick 

that really is

Into the wind

That 's a long kick and takes play just inside the Irish twenty-two far side of the field 

And full seven man line-out

The first England have called in the match

And Ackford at the front

Ackford wins it palms it down 

But the referee says it was knocked on and he gives the scrum to England  fifteen metres in

and this a good attacking position 



So third minute of the match

Hill to put in on the twenty-two 

and the referee Alain Chaconne comes to  pull the front rows up

They 're  binding very low indeed as Hill puts it in a deep line 

Hill runs off to try and get the penalty 

And there 's a shove

And here the England scrum driving forward

And that 's a tremendous scrum by England

They 've gained five metres

They 've swivelled round

And it 's a penalty kick to England

Simon Hodgkinson will be coming up to take this

And that really was a dynamic scrum



And so England that will be a tremendous psychological boost to them

They 've had Ackford winning a couple of line-outs and the first scrum there on their own put-in

They held it and then drove and drove again

And that 's very ominous for Ireland

If they 're going to be pushed around on England 's put-in to the scrum they 're going to have a very uncomfortable afternoon 

Simon Hodgkinson thirty-eight points in the championship this year

a hundred and sixty-four points of international rugby comes up

Kicks right-footed 

And he 's missed it 

He 's missed it  from  only twenty metres  to the ri left of the post

A fairly simple straightforward kick and he has missed it

So Ireland  breathe again as Brian Smith  his fifteenth international cap today seven for Australia his eighth for Ireland kicks off towards the near-side

Ackford takes that well

Good support from the English forwards 

And Hill waiting for the ball as they roll the ball

And Brian Moore has it now

He gets it

Gives it to Hill

Hoists it up high

It 's a very good kick indeed

Staples is underneath it

He gets Heslop on top

And Heslop puts the tackle in

but the free kick is awarded 

and that good play by the London Irish fullback 



Well a good play

Staples 's first international in front of his own crowd here at Lansdowne Road

And he took that ball well  just as Heslop arrived to put the tackle in

And his clearing kick  is  taking play up almost to the Irish twenty-two

So England call for the short line-out

Ackford jumping at the front Dooley in the middle Richards at the back 

Three Englishmen

They get it

Dooley gets it

Oh a bad palm

But Jason Leonard tidies it up for  England

And it 's offside against Ireland coming straight over the top there 

Two forwards 

The number eight Robinson and Brian Rigney both came straight over the top of Leonard

so Hodgkinson gets a second kick at goal





And I would think uh going back a couple of years to your playing days I don't think you would 've been happy if your forwards were palming out wild line-out well the way England have done twice





So this kick is almost fifty metres in from the near touch-line

It 's thirty metres from the post

A fairly straightforward kick  for Hodgkinson

He takes about eight paces 

And he comes up now right-footed  He hits

He kicks it 

It hits the upright comes back into play 

And Ireland clear their lines

Francis a long kick downfield

Carling takes it and almost slips 

Makes ground up

Hoists it

Gets  tackled

And the referee lets that go as Saunders catches it

Clears to touch virtually where he caught the ball 

And so it 'll be another line-out to England

And Hodgkinson would you believe has missed two kicks out of two 

The line-out

England this time having a four man

They 've tried a two they 've tried a three

Now it 's four

Teague joining  in

And again it 's won untidily

It 's knocked on  in the line-out by Ireland and I think the scrum will be given to England

It is  but for all their line-out  prowess England they haven't won a good clean ball yet





So Hill to put in

And this scrum will be thirty  metres from the Irish line fifteen in from the near touch-line

That 's the England right

England playing from left to right as we look out from the halfway line

They win this

a very very good scrum again

And Hill pops a little kick up

This time it 's just over the head of  Crossan who catches it 

Heslop catches him bundles him in to touch and 

Good play  by Hill

That was a much better kick

The weight of that was much better 

And England now are just fifteen metres  from the Irish line less than that

They 're ten twelve metres from the Irish line 

We 've had eight minutes of the first half

No score here

Two penalties missed by Hodgkinson 

and Moore to throw in

And having failed with a two man three man and four man line-outs England try seven man line to see if they can catch and tidy up

And Ackford does 

Takes it very well indeed but the referee says it wasn't straight 

So it 'll be a line-out a scrum rather or line-out again

And  Ireland choose the set scrum

and this 'll be interesting

on their own put-in to see if they can hold the scrum steady

and they do

They turn it round but it 's a good scrum

And Saunders 

Oh he makes a mess of that kick to touch though

Heslop takes it

He 's tackled by Crossan  winning his thirty-fifth  international cap for Ireland today

And that 's an Irish record overtaking  Trevor Ringland fellow Ulsterman who got thirty-four caps 

Crossan now is thirty-fifth

As England win that line-out ball out it comes with a penalty kick for  in the line-out against England 

and so Ireland will get a chance to clear 

But it 's ominous that  with nearly ten minutes of the first half gone the play 's all been in the Irish half





And a very good kick by Brian Smith takes play up to the halfway line

And this 'll be  another test for England

They 've had terrible trouble trying to win 

good line-out ball

Remember it is a heavy sodden pitch

It 's a wet slippy ball 

But they 're  very untidy palming and loose 

And they try the three man line-out

Ackford in the front Dooley in the middle Richards at the back

It goes

Ackford wins it again

Terrible untidy ball 

Proven tidies it up this time  and  England should win this

They drive forward 

Hill burrows in to get it from the feet of his pack  and eventually he does and he gets it out to Heslop on the wing

Heslop chips ahead up towards Staples on the Irish twenty-two

Staples takes it and right-footed sends a long kick  into no-man's-land

Hodgkinson takes it outside his outside his own  twenty-two sends a long pass out to Andrew 

Andrew up  to  the halfway

but he slices his kick

and he 'll

Surely offside 

A long way offside

Well  forty metres offside







So it 's still no score here

Nearly eleven minutes into the match

In Paris it 's still in the second half there fourteen points to three 

France leading Wales 

And Ireland have their first attacking scrum inside the England half in this match

They hold it at the back

The scrum collapses

The referee lets that go

And Saunders chips it up over his forwards but directly into touch by  about a metre 

So they 'll come back for a line-out  five metres inside the England half far side of the field

And this  the area that England were expected to  dominate so comfortably today 

But although they 've won the ball there 's been abysmal attacked possession that really has looked like uh junior school rugby

And the  master would be rocketing the forwards if they did that at a junior school level

They 've not tidied it up

They haven't got a sweeper

And there 's  palming again

This time they get it out but the referee Alain Chaconne says it wasn't straight

So it 's a scrum

So the line-out has been just a disaster for England now

They 've had I suppose about eight throws into the line-out

and they 've only once got the ball out as far as Rob Andrew to give him a chance to dictate the course of this match

The scrum  fifty metres in from the far touch-line the Irish right

And that 's a good scrum by Ireland  fed  to Saunders

He hoists a high kick up towards Hodgkinson

Hodgkinson  is there

Winterbottom gets his hands on it first

The whole of Ireland pour over the top there

And this is the ball they want to win on the English twenty-two 

But it won't come back from there I don't think 

The referee says it 's worth waiting for but there 's stamping by one of the Irishmen who I think quite rightly felt a little bit aggrieved that there was Wade Dooley lying right across the Irish side of that 

And it 's the the Irish way of saying that uh you 'd be better to go round than stay onside 

And I think that penalty could 've gone either way 





Andrew 's kick into the wind takes play up to the halfway line

And Ireland call a short line-out and they 've got Robinson at the front and Francis

Francis doesn't get his hands on it 

England win this

But again it 's bouncing around untidily

But they get it out to  Andrew

Andrew sends a pass a long pass and Guscott can't get his hands on it 

And it 'll be a line-out to England cos it went directly into touch

But that with a wet ball on a slippy day  wasn't the sort of pass to be rocketing out although England did have an overlap



So Moore to throw in on his own ten metre line near-side of the field the English right

And this time first  touch is won by Ireland and they have much more control

They 're playing a sweep but it tidies it up out to Smith 

Smith hoists it high up  towards the English twenty-two

Ackford is back

Dooley actually gets his hand on it 

And England win this

Hill scoops it up to Andrew

And right-footed Andrew sends again a superb kick under pressure  downfield and takes play back to the English ten metre line near-side of the field 

But that was a very much better controlled line-out possession by Ireland



So Francis at the front here

And it 's won by Philip Matthews at the back

He 's immediately tackled by  Mike Teague

England charge over the top

Leonard tidies it up

Proven 's in to try to support him 

And Teague and the all-English pack drive forward now

The ball comes back

Hill hoists it high

But straight to Jim Staples

That 's not a good kick

It gives him all the time in the world 

He gets it

Sends a kick downfield

Andrew 's covering in midfield

and he runs open now and puts in a kick  trying to bounce it and put it into touch

He does

Brian Smith gets one hand on it 

and he sends it to Hodgkinson 

all sorts of trouble there

and he goes back scoops it up 

but he manages to run out of defence now

He 's looking for support

He can't find any 

He eventually finds Heslop

But the ball 's gone loose and Ireland win it

And it comes back

And oh they have an overlap

And surely  they they they could 've got that away

And the referee could surely have played advantage

They had an overlap  on both sides of the field

It 's United who 've really had the best of the opening spell the first early attempt at goal coming from Paul Ince after some good work from Mark Hughes

That just went the wrong side of Jan Steskal 's post

The corner kick now floated in from the left

and Steskal going up to collect it comfortably on the edge of his own six-yard penalty area

United tonight playing with a familiar line-up

In goal Les Sealy back four of Irwin Bruce Pallister and Blackmore

in the middle Ince Bryan Robson returning to the line-up alongside Webb and Sharp

And then up front they have McClair and Hughes

The ball currently inside the centre circle with Webb who puts it back to Robson

And he tries the long chip forward for Lee Sharp which is cut out well by David Bardsley

Bardsley takes his place in a Rangers line-up that looks like this

Steskal in goal

Channing Bardsley Maddox and Sampson at the back

Barker Wilkins Wilson and Sinton in midfield

and up front Falco and Wegerle

And the ball at the moment with Paul Ince who chips it forward

Bardsley going across quickly as Mark Hughes lurked to knock it forward

It 's chested down here by Steve Bruce just inside his own half chipping the ball forward

It 's knocked down by McClair for Bryan Robson delighted to be back in the United line-up today

And he spreads it out to the left now to Lee Sharp

Sharp goes past his man

Gets to the by-line

He 's inside the penalty area

He 's made up a lot of good ground there before a vital interception came in from Clive Wilson

And that now earns Manchester United another corner kick away on that far side their left

And it 'll be Neil Webb who goes across to take it with Brian McClair waiting at the near post

Mark Hughes just on the edge of the six-yard box

Sharp Robson Pallister and Bruce all waiting along the edge of the eighteen-yard area

The corner coming out towards Pallister

He knocks it in there

McClair gets a good shot from Bruce

It cannons off a defender

Comes to the left of the Queen 's Park Rangers goal

And Roy Wegerle now keeps the ball in play as he comes away from his own penalty area and drags the ball up to the halfway line

Tackle coming in from Denis Irwin there

And as Bruce picked it up he was fouled

Free kick to United just inside the Rangers ' half

An early chance for us to hear from our guest tonight Duncan MacKenzie







Irwin has got the free kick in there

It 's knocked back  by Danny Maddox and going out to the far side flicked forward by Justin Channing

But then knocked forward for United by Webb

Interception coming in now

And Wilkins now brings it away  as they make the break forward with Bardsley

Bardsley now facing a challenge from Paul Ince puts a short ball back to Barker

And he goes back out to Wegerle on the far side

A good idea to set Barker away again

but a vital interception coming in from Blackmore

and now United move forward

It 's with Brian McClair

McClair moves down the centre

He 's got Hughes to his right 

And he was aiming for Mark Hughes  but the ball had too much power behind it and Kenny Sanson  had the easy job of shepherding it back to Jan Steskal

United on a good run at the moment whereas Rangers of course have been struggling in the First Division

Steskal 's  clearance brings another interruption in play

The flag is up for an offside decision

And the Queen 's Park Rangers coach Bobby Gould has come to the  uh halfway line because he can see that uh one of his players is back there injured

It uh looks like Justin Channing who 's receiving treatment 

It looks it 's 











Well that really is the worst possible start as far as Rangers are concerned because their team already shows uh a fair amount of deficiencies at the back there without Andy Tilson and Darren Peacock who are both cup-tied since their early season moves from Grimsby and Hereford respectively

They 've got long-term injuries of course in Alan McDonald and Paul Parker and Brian Law

And they were unable to pick Gus Caesar tonight because Arsenal the club that he 's on loan from clearly don't want him cup-tied



It is

Poor old Rangers

Who 'd be a football manager with a situation like that

Gary Pallister chips his free kick forward

It 's knocked away by Simon Barker for Queen 's Park Rangers

But Steve Bruce is in there

Bit of confusion though between him and Ince 

And quickly in there was Barker

Seemed a little bit of pushing going on

But United win it back and it 's now with Neil Webb just to the left of the centre circle

Pushed back to Pallister inside his own half

He 's crossed the halfway line now

Long ball alow the ground along the ground flicked up by Robson and then turned away by Kenny Sanson for Queen 's Park Rangers

Back with Gary Pallister who just let the ball run across the touch-line to earn Manchester United a throw-in about ten yards inside their own half on the near touch-line

Manchester United as we look in this first half defending the goal from left to right

They 're in their red tops and white shorts and I think we 're going to have a substitution at this early stage

It looks as though Rangers have decided that they can persevere with Channing 's injury no longer

And we 're going to see I think the introduction after just twelve minutes of Alan MacCarthy into the side 

And what an opportunity  this is for the youngster

He 'll be nineteen  on Friday and he 's going to get his chance in this F A Cup third round tie with Manchester United  following the injury to Channing







So MacCarthy 's now slipped into the centre alongside Maddox

And Bardsley has gone out to that  far side to be the right full back his uh more traditional role of course

Ball at the moment inside the Ranger 's half

It 's knocked forward by Webb and then turned away by Andy Sinton for Queen 's Park Rangers

Little flick on from Falco cut out well by Irwin

Now it 's with Gary Pallister and Steve Bruce

Plenty of space inside their own half

Chipped forward by Bruce down the centre

Hughes looking to chest it down

He was fouled from behind by Danny Maddox and that earns United a free kick

The ball was still rolling when Ince took it and in consequence the referee Mr Ashby from Worcester will bring it back to the required spot for it to be taken properly 

It 's going to be placed by Bryan Robson 

And the little extra time gives United the chance to regroup their forwards along the edge of the eighteen-yard box

McClair Hughes and Sharp are all there

Bruce has now  gone up to join them as well

Webb and Robson over the free kick

It 's left by Robson for Webb chipped in right-footed headed away only as far away as McClair though

McClair tries to knock it back in to Bruce

Now Ince gets a chance to get it forward

but it 's cleared by Clive Wilson from the edge of his own penalty area

Back inside the United half now

and with Gary Pallister to our left just squares the ball but badly

and it 's cut out now by Roy Wegerle

Wegerle moves forward down the inside right channel

He 's got Barker overlapping on the right but he 'll cut it forward looking for Falco 

Falco was being marked by Pallister and Irwin

And the ball ran too far for Falco allowing Irwin the time to clear and puts it behind for a throw



MacCarthy into the action getting a cross in which is brought down by Barker for Wegerle and then tucked out to the far side to David Bardsley

Bardsley now will try and cross it back into the middle

It 's far too near Les Sealy

and no problems for him in collecting that one

So a nice early touch for Alan MacCarthy which he 'll be  grateful of as he now takes his place back alongside the defence

Ray Wilkins has also dropped back just a a little bit and the ball now goes out to the far side to Blackmore

Chipped forward as United look to get 

Mark Hughes is just straight off side so the flag immediately up on the far side  indicates that Queen 's Park Rangers now have a free kick well inside their own half

Taken short by Ray Wilkins to uh Sanson and then out to the near side to Sinton

Quick lay-off

Brian McClair in there with the interception

Knocked forward

Hughes couldn't bring it under control

Ran beneath his right foot 

And David Bardsley with plenty of time to clear from the edge of his own penalty area

Totally wasted clearance though going straight across the touch-line on the far side to give United a throw-in which is taken short by Blackmore now to Steve Bruce 

Steve Bruce has a lot of room inside his own half playing it forward to Lee Sharp

Sharp coming under strong pressure from Bardsley and then Barker

Paul Ince decides to get involved

He has the last touch

Throw-in to Rangers far side well inside their own half

Bardsley is moving forward a little bit though

And I think he 'll be urged back before he uh  takes it

In fact a a free kick has been given

The ferocity of Ince 's challenge not going unnoticed by the referee

So Bardsley then with this free kick out on that right touch-line for Queen 's Park Rangers

Chipping it forward

Barker looking to get underneath it

Pallister 's up there first though with a header breaks to that far side

And Blackmore tried to keep it in play

He did get a touch but it still ran across the touch-line for a throw-in

Wegerle is keen to take it quickly and does so

A short one back to David Bardsley who lobs the ball into the middle another wasted opportunity and Sealy now looking to get United moving

But Hughes is the lone man up front at the moment

Can he hold it up long enough

He can

He can he 's got support now from Sharp who 's moved forward

so has Webb

so 's McClair

He tucks the ball back to Ince though

Ince trying to make progress down the inside left channel is hampered in that progress by Simon Barker and unfairly according to the referee

So it 'll be now a free kick

We 've had seventeen minutes of play then

Still Manchester United nil Queen 's Park Rangers nil in this third round F A Cup tie

And a free kick to Manchester United which 'll be taken by their captain Bryan Robson

A left-footed one into the middle

Webb is up there

It goes over his head  takes a knock off Kenny Sanson goes behind for a corner on the near side 

And Denis Irwin the full back has come up to take it 

Places it  as the  home fans  cheer on faithfully looking for that opening goal as Irwin floats the corner in

Pallister goes up just misses

Nice ball for Sharp there 

Wanted little too much time and his shot eventually came off Barker

Played forward by Robson

Hughes tries to lay it off for McClair

Comes back now for Neil Webb

And Webb wisely spots Irwin in space

Chipped into the middle by Irwin

Maddox missed the header  but it goes behind  for a goal kick

Maddox didn't actually make contact with it









No one should underestimate the teams of Don Howe and Bobby Gould

The Wimbledon of eighty-eight proved that of course

And if they can bring the tactical masters like Liverpool down then I 'm sure that Manchester United wouldn't pose that many problems despite the difference in league positions between these two sides

So a Southborough throw-in on the far side to United taken short by Blackmore to Steve Bruce

He chips it forward looking for Mark Hughes

Hughes trying to hold off the challenge of Maddox has to play a short ball back now

and Blackmore tries to set Ince away left edge of the penalty area

Ince in attempting to get it back out to Sh uh Sharp  was tackled from behind

And the ball runs out for a throw-in which Blackmore will take level with the edge of the Queen 's Park Rangers penalty area on the far side the United left

Blackmore gets the ball returned to him from a header from Robson

Cross comes in

Hughes is there

And that 's a goal for Manchester United

Mark Hughes sweetly in on the cross sends the ball into the top corner of Jan Steskal 's net

And the F A Cup holders are one nil ahead in this third-round F A Cup tie

With nineteen minutes of the match gone it 's Manchester United one Queen 's Park Rangers nil

A lot of pressure on that lad Lyons

And Maninga to kick off

A long ball

And I think most of these players will be  very eager just to get a touch of this ball  possibly keeping the the ball close here in the Great Britain side

It 's very wet

It 's very damp  very very slippy out there 

Certainly Great Britain won't want to lose possession here 

Good kick from Schofield 

Oh that 's a superb kick





And Ricky Stewart there the  Australian scrum half

And there is Schofield

Good kick from that number six

Good clean scrum 

Lyons 

Cliff Lyons no stranger to Gary Schofield

Played with him at Leeds a couple of seasons ago 

That 's a good tackle

That 's a good tackle there by Paul Dixon and Denis Betts 

This is what Great Britain have got to do

Well 

Now then 

Mr Sablerole insisting on five yards back

He penalised Australia very very heavily at Wembley 







So Ricky Stewart

It 's a put to touch 

And Australia 's first  first attack

Stewart 's looking for instructions  lucky to get play moving

Played at stand off in the uh  the Wembley test but here in his natural position for Canberra Raiders at scrum half 

Steve Roach a most experienced Australian forward

Fifteen test caps to his credit 

Australia less than the weight in this pack

but still got big men like Sirodan 

Seventeen and a half stone this number eleven 

And Lazarus

Lazarus with the headgear on

Seventeen stitches there in the a head wound 

Well that 's the fifth tackle 

Great Britain certainly won't want to  be put under pressure here 

Not a good kick 



Very nervous very tense time this in the early minutes 

Either side only to make a mistake 

And a penalty  against Sirodan 

There 's certainly one thing about this uh man from Avignon

He 's very firm 

Makes the decisions immediately

Won't stand any messing 

And youngster  Paul Eastwood such a success  in the first test from Hull 

He took two tries and uh three goals 

Carl Harrison  team mate at Hull 

Paul Dixon 

That 's a good run by Dixon 

And I think that this uh Great Britain pack have got a lot more confidence since that eighty minutes at Wembley 

And the weather relenting

Not really for the first time 

Offside again 

A good decision by Mr Sablerole

He 's signalling that there were two men inside the five yard area 

And what will Paul Eastwood do 



Looking for a good kick from Eastwood

And that is a good kick 

And suddenly this huge crowd get behind Great Britain

the first time in Australian territory 

Paul Eastwood does strong youngster 

Great Britain still using this pack 

That 's a good ball to Betts 

Almost a hint of obstruction 

Now Schofield so influential  much stronger than his early days 

Little Gregory  looking for the pass 

Again Ricky Stewart there keeping a very very sharp eye on Gregory

This would be the interesting battle the two halfbacks

An attempted drop  from Schofield

No

Just to the left of the post







And offside again 

This French referee

Insistence on keeping the two sides apart

And I And I think it 's it 's good for the game 

The Australian pack lost a few pounds in weight with the  with the changes the uh removal 

Cartwright in specially 

That 's a bad kick 

Howard 

Jackson 

Hanley so good on that uh left foot 

That 's a good run by Hanley

Just can't get away

But that 's how dangerous this man is 

And another six tackles 

To Harrison 

Great Britain stretching them wide 

And to Gregory 

Oh that 's a bad ball 

Hanley 

Again so difficult to put down 





Great Britain on the attack

Gregory at first receiver again 

Still on level terms

Great Britain  nil Australia nil

Little Gregory again 

That 's a good one  for Belcher 

Oh he 's missed it

No he hasn't 

And it 's Australia ball

Six new tackles 

Australia under pressure

Glen Lazarus there with the head bandaged

Seventeen stitches in his head  in a head wound at Castleford last Sunday 

But Great Britain started off very confidently 

To Roach 

Stewart 

MacKay 

And the the fifth tackle 

Australia certainly  looking to kick 

And a good one from Elias 





Platt

Andy Platt

Only one game in the last five weeks

Had  cartilage problems this Wigan prop forward 

Schofield determined that Great Britain won't be caught down there 

Sending Belcher back again 

And it 's Schofield there again  with Jeysop 

Daly 

Lyons looking for Maninga 

And little Gregory 

The only thing he can do

Five foot four  to six foot two

He has to jump around his chest 

And there 's Gregory again 

Well 

Well little uh Andy Gregory there

Having an i altercation with Glen Lazarus 

And Lazarus certainly won't want any  hits around the head there

Seventeen stitches in a wound

Brave lad to be playing 













And Australia now on the attack 

Certainly these penalties have got to be counted 

MacKay 

Good ball to Roach 

And he loses it 

A little bit of indiscipline there amongst the Australians

We 're not normally accustomed to seeing that

Gratefully received by Paul Dixon

And back to six more tackles again 















Good decision there from the French referee

And a good kick again from Paul Eastwood 

No nerves this time

A little nervous at Wembley in the opening ten minutes

but  settled down now this home wing 

Harrison 

Good runs by Paul Dixon this Leeds forward

Matured a lot on the New Zealand tour in the summer 

That 's a good run by Gregory 

With Gregory and Schofield already giving a lot of trouble to these Australians here at first and second receiver

There 's Schofield again 

Hanley 

No waiting 

Hampson 

And the fifth tackle 

Schofield again looking for the drop 

Well a good tackle











Great Britain moving in very very quickly

But that 's a good run by Roach

To Maninga

 

Oh good run  one man there 

Good tackle by Schofield 

Superb play by the Australians

Now that they want to move it fast from left to right they do 

Elias 

To Belcher 

This is a good run from the Kangaroos 

Oh he 's held on too long 

Held on too long 

And the fifth tackle 

Elias  doing a lot of kicking in midfield 

It 's a good one

It 's beaten Gregory 









And already  we can see Ben Elias the hooker there number nine  not only doing a good role there in the middle but uh a good kicking role  something which I think Australia lacked in the first test 

Schofield 

As I 've said partners at Leeds Lyons and Schofield

so they should know everything about each other 's play

but 

That 's a  penalty

Is it

Well  is uh  Cliff Lyons being very dramatic

or was it a penalty

Certainly Monsieur  Sablerole didn't notice anything and he 'd had no help from the touch judge 

And we play on

Andy Platt

Good driving done there by this uh this Wigan prop forward 

Gregory 

Oh that 's good play

Gibson

He 's got Offiah

Offiah 's gone inside 

A chance gone begging there I think

If Offiah 'd stayed outside 

What adventurous football from Great Britain 

And a good kick from Schofield 

Belcher wanting it to go over

It does 

Sensible play there from Belcher 







Still Great Britain nil Australia nil 

But Great Britain the vital one test up in the series 

Just fourteen minutes gone

Both sides still looking for the first points on the board 

And Laurie Daly there number four playing with uh  right hand

And then he struck ball to Gregory 





To Denis Betts 

Good tackle there by Bob Linden

Had a good tour

Bobby Linden 

Jackson 

Now Harrison 

That 's a good ball to Schofield 

That 's a better ball to Hanley 

Darryl Powell

Schofield again

This is superb rugby 

Still Schofield to Eastwood 

but I think the Australian cover 's back

It is

Good tackle there 

copybook stuff for any youngster watching

Scrum half Stewart  coming across

But this is good rugby 

Gregory 

Looked for a short ball  and the fifth tackle 

Now then what will Great Britain do a drop-goal or a chip 

Play on

Six more tackles  to Hanley 

When the ball hits the opposition  another six tackles 

Darryl Powell  strong Sheffield even centre  in  and Gibson with defensive game at Wembley

Schofield again the short ball 

Looks for support

Oh gets a beautiful pass to Dixon

He 's going for the line 

Is he over

Mr Sablerole 's on the spot

He says no 

He says no

And he 's the final arbiter

What a beautiful piece of rugby there from Schofield 

Beautiful piece of rugby between those two Leeds lads 

Schofield the short pass and Dixon the drive







So vital tackle there from the Australians 

Almost the first try of the game

Ricky Stewart  to Fee

He gets the ball

Little Gregory 's on to him 



Australia have been making the errors but they are not the world champions for nothing

They are resilient

They 're class players in this green and gold outfit

And there is one

Paul Name from Name 

Stewart

He 'll be looking for kick 

It 's a high one

No real distance

Well taken by Eastwood 

Strong powerful youngster

His fourth test cap today

Interesting to see Paul Dixon

He seemed to be following Gary Schofield everywhere





And Gregory and Schofield always at first and second receiver

To Hanley 

Great sidestep 

Good tackle by  Brad Mackay 

Betts 

And the fifth tackle 

That 's a bad ball 

That 's not a bad kick 

Offiah 's underneath it

So was Belcher 

And Belcher wins it 

Paddy Belcher of the Canberra Raiders warmly appreciated by that crowd 

Australia surely will want to settle the game down

They 'll want to consolidate their position and get away from here

As John Morny said they 've really been down here for so long

Oh that 's a good break by Elias 









That 's touch

Excellent kick 

Superb kick there

Ricky Stewart  Canberra scrum half  receiving a lot of instructions from the bench 

But again Great Britain 's header ball

Little Gregory to feed the scrum 

He does

Good scrum

Good heel 

 now then 

I was going to say a little indecision there but uh  Great Britain got away with it 





Suddenly  a lull in the game

A lull in the crowd as if Australia  have weathered the storm

Great Britain coming back for a second breath

Good dummy 

Andy Platt

It 'll be interesting to see whether he can get eighty minutes in a in a test match

Been out for four weeks 

That 's a good kick by Gregory

That is a strong kick 

Sends Belcher back

but well picked up 

Good tackle by Hanley 

That 's a good run by Daley

Now then he 's got Shearer in space

Oh he should 've gone out the side 

Shearer not trusting to his pace 

But it 's Australia now spreading the ball to Belcher 

Lyons 

Good tackle by Hampton 

Elias

Nobody with him 

Monsieur Sablerole pushing Great Britain back 

Australia 's turn to attack now

Steve Roach

Dean Paul playing prop 

And the fifth tackle 

Lyons

Well that should be another six tackles

It is

Monsieur Sablerole waves play on 

Belcher  merely  running into the hands of Platt 





If only Denis Betts could have picked that ball up and got it out to Offiah

But he couldn't 

But it 's Great Britain still in possession

Still looking for a vital point

Gregory

The

Ooh

that 's a tackle and a half from Mani from Maninga 

Gibson 's OK

Offiah 

Australia keeping a very very close eye on this Widnes flyer

Schofield again pushing them down the sideline

That 's a good kick 

Keeping this big Australian pack moving backwards 

That was one of the successes at Wembley that Schofield did

He moved this big Australian pack around the field

He tired them out  and then they were not there in the middle for the charges 

Big crowd here at Old Trafford enjoying this 

Twenty-two minutes gone 

Still Great Britain nil Australia nil

Good heel

Brad Mackay 

But dumped unceremoniously by Denis Betts 









That 's intelligent

Certainly one of the lads having an influence in this number nine here attacking half back Benny Elias 

Again very tight as we expect of test matches

Towards the centre Ten of Spades and Ballyhane  and also Southern Air

Mr Frisk in the middle

Big Son 's in the middle

Harley is towards the far side

So too over on the far side is while I just turn round

I couldn't quite see

That was Docklands Express

Now they 've all turned round again

So we 'll give you a clue as to where they 're coming 

And now Master Bob 's turned round they 've broken up the line

They 've taken away another person who 's run across the start

Two policemen have arrested the man 

Astonishingly  stupid to run across the course fifty yards from the start of a Grand National

It really revives memories of uh what happened at Epsom uhm uh when the suffragettes ran across

And uh  another  And two policemen have had to come and remove two more people who seem determined to stop the Grand National starting 

So meanwhile another delay for the jockeys 

Uhm policemen on horseback coming forward now 

Let 's find out while all this is happening if Mark 's got any change in the betting 

And still s no sign of the National starting 

And the field has broken up

They were lining up a moment ago

They 're now walking round 

More and more people are being arrested

Police are  heavily enforced there

They 're being taken over to the far side 

Uh mounted police now cantering back towards the start

Meanwhile the rest of the runners are circulating 

So we still don't know which side they 're going

So  cancel that original instruction Lee MacKenzie uhm because uh  they 're going to form a new line 

And now they are beginning to

The starter 's calling them in at last at last

Now on the left Garrison Savannah Team Challenge Seagram and Oklahoma  and  Rinus

Also Bonanza Boy on the inside

That 's on the left 

Behind uh Mick 's Star in the centre Ballyhane New Halen and Southernair 

On the far side the outside Over The Road Abba Lad and Crammer 

And out of line is uh Solidasarock

He 's on the outside

so too is Master Bob 

And another one The Langholm Dyer out on the far side

Almost all in line  with the exception of Crammer  and Old Applejack

He 's coming up into line now  Old Applejack 

And  a roar from the crowd

It wasn't all go that time

Bumbles Folly playing up on the outside

They 'll go without

Bumbles Folly straightens up 

They 're all in a good line

There 's a good 

They 're off and running for the National

And one of the first to show

Yahoo in the centre

Blue Dart 

Also up there Golden Frieze and Oklahoma for France leading across the Melling Road 

Oklahoma Golden Frieze Garrison Savannah Seagram and Mr Christian

And over to Lee MacKenzie

And Over The Road on the outside is just in front with Docklands Express right up there

Southernair is prominent

Golden Frieze Mr Christian and Oklahoma right there on the inside as they come to the first of the thirty fences

That 's the first

Oklahoma just landed first over the first

Docklands Express

A fall at the first badly hampered Crammer but there were no other fallers

Bonanza Boy is last of all as they come to the second

Oklahoma on the inside

Golden Frieze is second

Mr Christian 's over there in third

Ballyhane

Run And Skip was a faller there

The others have all cleared it though as they come on out of the big open ditch

And Oklahoma for France on the inside just leads from Golden Frieze

These two disputing it  as they jump the ditch with Mr Christian

Ten Of Spades just behind with Blue Dart

Then Ballyhane

Leagaune on the outside

They 're all over the ditch although Envopak Take Token made an appalling mistake at the back

He 's still going with Bonanza Boy

And on to the fourth now with Oklahoma on the inside with Golden Frieze as we join Tony O'Hehir

So out towards fence number ten is Golden Frieze still with the whip hand from Mr Frisk Over The Road

Up on the outside General Chandos

Garrison Savannah just in behind the leaders

And so they jump that one and there 's no casualties

The tail-end are still coming through

But they come up towards this open ditch

Golden Frieze still the leader from General Chandos Over The Road

Then comes Mr Frisk

Racing with him on the near-side is Rinus

And so that 's the leading quartet

Closely followed then by Garrison Savannah

And then comes Oklahoma on the near-side

They have one more fence before they go up to the Melling Road

General Chandos now comes up to join Golden Frieze in the lead

These two are being followed by Rinus

Then comes Mr Frisk

Mr Frisk then being tracked by Over The Road

Up on the outside is New Halen

Then on the inside we have Durham edition

Golden Minstrel also not far off the pace

Then comes Yahoo just about uh well towards the middle division as they go over the Menning Road

And back to Peter Bromley

Well Golden Frieze is the leader from General Chandos

Rinus at close third

Mr Frisk is fourth there followed by Over The Road

Then New Halen on the outside of Ballyhane who 's inside

And behind Ballyhane comes Blue Dart

Behind Blue Dart is Team Challenge

And then comes Durham Edition

And towards the centre of the course is Seagram still there

And they 're coming up towards this next plain fence which is number thirteen

And Golden Frieze in the white cap still the leader from General Chandos towards the centre

Over on the left it 's Mr Frisk

Tucked in behind is Rinus in third

And they jump that fence 

And the leaders are all safely over that 

Coming to the next fence

And it 's Golden Frieze from Rinus in the centre

Then General Chandos

Behind General Chandos in the centre is Over The Road

Then Garrison Savannah just behind the leading group with Team Challenge coming up there and Oklahoma well placed

Then Ballyhane and Blue Dart and Durham Edition and Mr Christian and Ten Of Spades and Hew Halen

Then comes Bigsun and Crammer

They 're coming to the chair fence now

And the two Jenny Pitman horses early in the lead there

Garrison Savannah over in third

Crammer 's a faller there

Yahoo

a mistake

Passing the water jump now

And it is now  on the stand side up there in the lead Golden Frieze

Over there on the far side Team Challenge

Oklahoma 's third

And behind Oklahoma comes Rinus then Garrison Savannah and General Chandos

Behind General Chandos on the inside is Ballyhane

And then Over The Road and Durham Edition and New Halen

Then comes Auntie Dot and Mr Christian and Blue Dart and Seagram

Then Ten Of Spades

Behind him is Bigsun and on the outside Mr Frisk

And behind Mr Frisk on the far side is  is uh on the far side is  as they go up  Foyle Fisherman

Now over the Menning Road with Golden Frieze in the lead over to Lee MacKenzie

And plenty still standing in the National as Golden Frieze leads them to the seventeenth now from Team Challenge on the inside

New Halen running a blinder up there in third

Rinus going well

And Ballyhane moving up to the leaders too

Seagram comes tucked in behind

Here comes Durham Edition with a late-runner as usual

Then just behind him is uh Auntie Dot

And then comes Blue Dart just behind the leaders

Over The Road comes next

and then Foyle Fisherman as they take that one

And there were no fallers there or at the previous fence although Abba Lad is pulling up at the back

And now to the big open ditch where Golden Frieze is just in front from Oklahoma on the inside

And taking this one Rinus with a good jump on the outside jumps into the lead there

Rinus from Golden Frieze

then Garrison Savannah third

New Halen fourth

then Oklahoma

No fallers at the ditch

As they go on to the next Mick 's Star has tailed off

And over fence number twenty with Golden Frieze

And Rinus has fallen there

Rinus down as we join Tony O'Hehir

Up to now fence number twenty-six

Garrison Savannah in the lead

Golden Frieze still holding his place

Auntie Dot

Then comes Seagram then being trapped in

On the far side Over The Road

But Garrison Savannah on the near-side just about the leader

And then on the far side his stable companion Golden Frieze

Seagram comes cruising up between them

So does Auntie Dot

And right up on the outside is Over The Road

That 's the leading four as they come over this open ditch

The leading four then followed by Durham Edition Foyle Fisherman

And then comes Leagaune and also Old Applejack

And uh Bigsun 's been pulled up

They race now towards the next fence for the Melling Road

It 's still Garrison Savannah

Auntie Dot

Then comes Seagram

Golden Frieze up on the outside

Over The Road

Durham Edition

That 's the leading six there followed by Foyle Fisherman

Then comes Old Applejack

Leagaune on the inside

Golden Minstrel comes next

Then comes Harley

And so that 's the order as they come back onto the main racecourse

And back to Peter Bromley

Garrison Savannah the leader from Auntie Dot

Seagram at close third

Then comes Durham Edition

And on the outside of Durham Edition is Over The Road

And these are a long way clear of Old Applejack and Golden Frieze

They 've got two more fences to jump in the National about a half a mile to go

Garrison Savannah and Mark Pitman on the inside

Seagram on the outside of him with the red cap

In third place now is Auntie Dot

Then comes Over The Road and Durham Edition

This is the second last

They 're coming to it now

Garrison Savannah over from Seagram

Garrison Savannah and Mark Pitman clear of Seagram

In third place is Auntie Dot

Then Durham Edition and Over The Road and Old Applejack

And then comes Team Challenge

They 're coming now to the next

And over the last fence

Garrison Savannah safely over clear

And he 's got about ten lengths between him and Seagram

Seagram in second place

Auntie Dot in third

Durham Edition is fourth

Over The Road is fifth

 Garrison Savannah the gold cup winner with two hundred yards to go

Seagram is closing on him

Garrison Savannah is 

Seagram 's coming

Seagram is going to catch Garrison Savannah

Seagram wins the Grand National with twenty-five yards to go 

Seagram 

Seagram has done it 

Seagram wins the National

Garrison Savannah is only second

Auntie Dot is third

We 've got to go a long way back to find a fourth

but  horses

it 's maybe Over The Road

Over The Road is fourth

Bonanza Boy is fifth

Durham Edition is sixth

And then behind him uh just coming up on the far side is another one 

Then just finishing Leagaune Old Applejack Foyle Fisherman Ballyhane Harley  Mick 's Star Ten Of Spades

The last two who 're coming in will be Yahoo

And the last one was Forest Ranger  and the one that I just missed out

I have a feeling I 've just missed one out that finished  and I can't remember which one it was

Doesn't really matter now

But Seagram has landed the Grand National  the low-key of the banner of the sponsoring company 

and war was there ever a more appropriate winner

Seagram

Not owned by Seagram 's

but Seagram owned by Sir Eric Parker who had such foul luck at Cheltenham when his good horse Garcid was killed in the race that he sponsored

Trained by David Barons in Kingsbridge Down in Dor Devon and ridden by young Nigel Hawke

The second was a horse that could 've made history but he didn't quite last home

It was Garrison Savannah in the hands of Mark Pitman

He 'll never get eleven one in a handicap again

Owned by Autofour Engineering trained by Jenny Pitman and Upper Landon Lambourne

And third was Auntie Dot owned by Mrs R Wilson trained by John Webber of Banbury and ridden by Mark Dwyer

The fourth horse was Over The Road

And plenty of horses finished

An appropriate winner

Arony a front runner

He would like it soft though

He won at Chester 

And one more I think to go

they 're bringing him forward now and that 's the top one

that 's Dolpoor number one 

That looks like it 

They 're all in

This is the Diamond Stakes two forty-five

They 're off and running 

And the first one to show in front

Poor old Dolpoor going up

He 's been chased up there

It 's Just Free

And I think he 's the early leader as they go up the hill

Then it 's Just Free

just about the leader

And settling down on the inside Eton Lad

On the outside name with Arony

And then tucked in behind them comes Punch And Run and A Good Pitch with Peter Wallwin 's horse Northern Howe next

But it 's still Just Free out in front on the inside rail blinkered of course

And then on the his outside is Arony

Then comes Eton Lad

Just behind Eton Lad Punch And Run on the inside 

On the outside of him is Northern Howe 

And they 're coming round Tattenham Hill down towards Tattenham Corner 

And it is still up there in front Just Three  from Arony on the stand side

And these two are well clear of the field as they sweep left-handed down with Eton Lad showing third

and Northern Howe and Punch And Run and Message Pad

And then comes Silver Honda

Behind him Dolpoor

Behind Dolpoor Enharmonic with plenty of work to do

And at Tattenham Corner now

Three and a half furlongs to run

and Just Free on the far side is still the leader 

Just Free being pressed all the time by Arony

Eton Lad coming into perspective now

On the outside is Northern Howe

Message Pad trying to get on terms but not making much headway 

Two furlongs out

and a real race with Eton Lad coming through to take it up

Silver Honda on the stand side as the challenger

Northern Howe between horses

Coming late and fast is Regal Sabre

They 're two furlongs out

And it 's Silver Honda in the lead but they 're queuing up to challenge him

Over on the far side it 's Fair Average that looks the danger 

Sabre Regal Sabre too

Silver Honda the leader from Fair Average

On the line Silver Honda the winner

Fair Average is second

Regal Sabre Enharmonic

Then behind him came Eton Lad who fluttered

And then behind him Northern Howe and Message Pad and Dolpoor and Just Free Punch And Run

Last of all is Arony 

So Silver Honda twenty to one has created a tremendous surprise

But guess who trains him

Clive Britten

And uh the pace should be injected by Lord Chalmer the front runner

And it 's Steve Cauthen out in front showing the way to in second place

Rocky Romance in the green colours and then the black and white colours is uh Gwecko Solo

Running the rail in the yellow is Honey Church

and then Living Image with a red cap Croupier in the violet colours and the red cap and out at the back taking quite a key hold Hembury Hall the grey jockey George Duffield in the yellow sleeve jacket 

So they swing into the home straight

and they 're coming down  stand side

and they 're getting sorted out

Indian file with Lord Chalmer setting the pace and a good one too to in second place  Gwecko Solo

And then behind these comes Honey Church with Croupier in the violet colours sharing that third spot

A length behind these Living Image shows five

And a gap just opening up to the other two

Hembury Hall on the left with the yellow sleeves the grey

and uh Rocky Romance is out at the back too 

But Steve Cauthen not messing about setting a very good pace on this Lord Chalmer who 's uh leading by a couple of lengths to Gwecko Solo with a white cap

On the right Croupier with the  cerise cap

The red cap

that 's Living Image

Blue cap is Honey Church

A gap of two to the York winner Hembury Hall

and Rocky Romance finding it all a bit hard 

They 're coming down towards the three

And still Lord Chalmer bowling along uh still has it by a length or so

but Gwecko Solo getting a bit closer in the white cap getting closer by uh every stride

Living Image coming there with a run too through into third

Croupier 's run has gone th on

Honey Church is out of it and so too Hembury Hall

Just uh two to go

and it 's Lord Chalmer who 's clear by three now

and he 's stolen this

Lord Chalmer coming out of the stand side but a long way clear of the chasing group

And from the front Lord Chalmer has dominated and he is annihilating the opposition

It 's Lord Chalmer coming clear by six inside the final furlong

Steve Cauthen 's encouraging him for extra effort

He 's a long way clear

Check over to the right shoulder and over to the left

And it 's going to be Lord Chalmer who wins it very easily indeed from a photo second

Gwecko Solo and Honey Church two three

Then Living Image and Croupier

A big gap to Hembury Hall who disappointed rather badly

but even further behind Hembury Hall was Rocky Romance

And so the result of this Food Brokers ' Plaque Stakes

it 's a graduation race

Lord Chalmer at seven to two has won by making all the running  under Steve Cauthen

And a determined drive in the last uh two furlongs saw him come home well clear of Gwecko Solo flat at two out but uh had no answers when this horse uh quickened the tempo

and Honey Church back in third on our evidence there

Honey Church in the yellow sleeve uh colours worn by Jimmy Fortune 

Frankie Dettori on duty

up at Ripon

But you can see how th this gives that this s picture gives you some indication of the hill between one and a half and two

It 's not quite uh art the Eiger but it really is a stiff climb up to the line

And it 's uh Lord Chalmer coming home clear now with uh Gwecko Solo in the white cap

Tony Cruise can dome do no more

Steve checks over his uh shoulder to see if there are any dangers

There are none whatsoever

And his good run is continuing on this horse Lord Chalmer who rather lost his way after that very impressive win  first time out at the Roly Mile

You never know

perhaps he doesn't like travelling

Might win his best races at Newmarket

Plenty of room here

And they break away

And Sibor very smartly into his stride

and he 's uh coming right over to these stands ' rails

and it 's Sibor who leads the way running his own race clear of the main group of runners who are headed by Xaxis in the uh blue 

Also with the pace on the extreme right is Ypres

that 's the horse with the noseband

Uh not that far away is Perjury in the pink and grey

Quietly Impressive behind that and then My Three Girls in black and orange

Two lengths back to Replicate

Nayo Fasmal in the uh brown jacket but Sibor is right on the stands ' rails

And that one has overall command

Meanwhile the main group of runners come down the centre of the track

And it 's uh Waypost in the lead with Xaxis

Xaxis leading the main group

There 's Sibor on the extreme left as they come down towards the halfway stage

Sibor isolated and lonely running the rail down the centre of the track

It 's Xaxis in the lead

And then just in behind these comes Perjury

Off the pace Replicate 's starting to pick up

and then Nayo Fasmal

And then behind Nayo Fasmal Quietly Impressive in the green colours

They 've got just over two and a half to go now

And down the centre of the track it 's still Xaxis who 's clear

Sibor right on the rails

Then Quietly Impressive through for third

Devon Joe is off the face and then Perjury

And then behind these starting to pick up is Replicate

They race down into the dip

Just over a furlong and a half to go

and it 's Quietly Impressive in the green colours who 's come storming through to take it up

Next to the rails Sibor keeping on well

but it 's Quietly Impressive who opens up as they meet rising ground

Coming inside the final furlong

and Quietly Impressive out on his own now

Sibor the rail uh with a long way behind him but picking up nicely

Replicate

And as they gallop towards the line Quietly Impressive takes it

At the line Quietly Impressive is the winner

It 's very close for second

Replicate and Sibor

They break away

And Altaya the grey very smartly into her stride and also showing pace in the black jacket name

Uh Young Pretender on the right of the group now in the  yellow colours is also showing very good pace

Finjan on the left in blue is in the li firing line too

A length behind these Piquant shows pace

and then Zimbak in green  with uh  in the black jacket

Off the pace Green Dollar with a white cap

With a blue cap name out the back

Also at the back is name

But they uh  huddle in the centre of the track as they come down to half way

And it 's Altaya leading

Young Pretender on the right

 finding the pace a bit hot

And then behind these comes Zimbak

Piquant not that far away

and Finjan starts a charge

Uh they 've got just over two to go now

And it 's the grey Altaya still still has it from Young Pretender in the yellow

Behind these came Zimbak and Finjan  followed by  and  and Bernstein Bette

And last of all was Sally 's Son

And Mack the Knife uh really came out of the stalls fast has the early call with Royal Prussia

Hollywood Harry with racing experience on the left

And Filial in the blue cap uh tracks them through 

Not a very big field but uh the race 's usually won by a horse of moment

So it 's Hollywood Harry that goes on with Mack the Knife on the right  striding a length and a half to the good over Royal Prussia in the white sleeves

Blue cap is Filial and Magadir at the back 

So they 're still coming down towards the halfway stage in this Primula Maiden Stakes

 at six furlongs

And it 's Hollywood Harry leading from uh Mack the Knife in second

and then Filial through on the stand side

That 's the filly with the white face

And getting closer now as they come down into the two marker

but they 're all there with a shout

Royal Prussia is not done with on the near side

Difficult to see Magadir

but that one 's now getting a bit closer too

And that 's Filial shaking it and just quickening the tempo

But Mack the Knife is trying to go with her

However Filial just lengthens as they meet rising ground

Uphill to home now

Filial has pulled clear

And all of a sudden this uh race looks all over

For inside the final furlong it 's Filial striding clear and Mack the Knife trying to raise his gait

But Filial has all the answers

And at the line Filial just pushed out easily from Mack the Knife in second 

And then through in third was Magadir followed by Royal Prussia

And Hollywood Harry dropped out to be last of all

And so the result then of this Primula Maiden Stakes

it 's a win for number five Filial in the colours of the Cheevely Park Stud the six to four favourite trained here at Newmarket by Michael Stud and ridden by George Duffield

Second horse home was number two Mack the Knife who was out of the stalls like a flash and had the early running

But that uh may not have paid to i in his favour uh inside the final furlong so

He is uh just covered up behind our leader there Filial

But now as they 've uh come up this uh steep hill to home it 's Filial this daughter of Lefard

Cost a lot of money but she 's come home in style

George Duffield just having to shake her up 

Racing experience here will tell

And uh obviously she 's going to be a tough nut to crack as the season progresses because I could well see her going to the end of the season unbeaten

Very smooth performance

Classy

Classy

this one

They 've only just started this race

So coming up to ten laps to go this time round and here 's some of the other names of those involved

Eamonn Martin who will uh definitely be going to Tokyo in our world championship team but in the ten thousand metres not the five thousand metres 

uh Rob Denmark who uh Jim has already mentioned

Ian Hamer

Jack Butler former European champion as well 

A big field thirty-four involved altogether

And remember this weekend only the first man in each race or woman in the women 's events of course is guaranteed a place in Tokyo 

A sixty-six second lap

so they 've been uh clocking sixty-five sixty-six seconds since the start of the race

The leader incidentally is Nigel Adams the twenty-nine-year-old from Swansea  who was seventh in the United Kingdom ten thousand metres championships

Ea Eamonn Martin in the yellow vest and blue shorts running in fourth  just behind Rob Denmark 

Meanwhile we 've got the triple jump on

This is Jonathan Edwards

the first round

The lead is held at sixteen metres twenty-five  to the credit of Vernon Samuels

and Jon Edwards has been in magnificent form this year many times over seventeen metres

That 's some way short of it but it might well be an improvement on the lead 

Samuels sixteen twenty-five Francis Agyepong sixteen twenty-three Julian Golley sixteen O one

so  already three British athletes over sixteen metres 

Let 's look again at the Gateshead Harrier Jon Edwards

Won't take part of course on Sundays so he can't compete in the world championships but he 's certainly looking for a three As title here

Yes he 's done it

The distance has come up 

Sixteen metres thirty-eight

So let 's look again at the overhead camera

He 's some way behind the board there so there 's probably more to come in the remaining five jumps that he 'll have in the event

Just coming up to eight laps to go now in the five thousand metres and Nigel Adams still leading 

There 's Eamonn Martin number twenty-one  who has been suffering from a cold lately but has otherwise been going exceptionally well in his training sessions 

Well as I say  he 's guaranteed a Tokyo place in the ten thousand metres the distance at which he is United Kingdom record-holder and reigning Commonwealth champion

Gary Staines not running in this race uh not competing at all in the five thousand metres is another who would almost certainly be pencilled in by the selectors

That 's because he 's last year 's European silver medallist

Yes so many intriguing little stories go into this weekend of athletics 

So many hopes will be uh raised and dashed just as quickly 

It really has the element of sudden death about it this particular weekend 

A lot of people 's uh ambitions will be fulfilled but there 'll be a lot more disappointed 

Number twenty-seven there who I don't think we mentioned yet John Nuttall

And uh just behind him wearing number nine this young man Rob Denmark who 's made a very dramatic impact on the scene this evening

He actually does a bit of training with Eamonn Martin in Essex who is running right alongside there

Eamonn Martin number twenty-one Denmark number nine

He moved to fourth on the United Kingdom all-time list with that marvellous race in Rome nine days ago when he clocked thirteen minutes thirteen point zero one right up there with the bests the best the Walcrofts the Butlers of this world 

Meanwhile on the triple jump we 're back with Jonathan Edwards

There 's the big clapping all down the runway that was pioneered by Willy Banks

And actually he 's competing here tonight

The world record holder 

Again Jonathan Edwards took takes off way behind the board

He 's jumping well but uh  he needs that the ten centimetre board and he needs a little bit more than that as well

Well since we 'd we saw him before there 's been no further change in the competition 

He still leads from Samuels and Agipon 

so I don't think that uh jump by Edwards uh just going up at the moment in fact is going to be better

No it isn't

It 's sixteen metres thirteen 

Five laps to go in the five thousand metres

We 've had the same leader throughout Nigel Adams

But now moving up in the green vest into about sixth place is Jack Butler  who 's had a such such a dreadful time with injuries over the last couple of years

Former European champion 

And uh this is a vital race too for him

He 's gradually climbed his way back into contention

Twenty-nine now he 's had four races so far

There he is right in the middle of the picture wearing number four in the green vest

Four races in the nineteen ninety-one season

He 's been getting a little bit better each time 

Some amongst them moving up there

That 's a good move

They 've really got to run exceptionally well over these last five laps

They 've got to average sixty-one point five now for the last five laps to get them near the qualifying time

I don't understand why some of these boys haven't really taken the pace up earlier

People like Jack Butler and that should 've really

There is Jack back there one of our top men in the past at five thousand metres

He should have realised that the pace is woefully slow and should have made the move even if he 's got to sacrifice himself

It 's his only chance really 

Well here is the world record holder Willy Banks who in fact is some way down from his uh leading form now fifteen metres fifty-eight in the first round

and he holds the world record at seventeen metres ninety-seven

He 's certainly getting plenty of support from the crowd though

They are wishing him back to the form that he showed throughout the nineteen-eighties 

And a great favourite

Well I think that may be a better jump for him but it won't be I think good enough to take the lead from Britain 's Jonathan Edwards 

Good to see Willy Banks keep competing of course even though he 's no longer a challenger and won't of course be in the American Championships team for Tokyo 

Coming up to three laps to go now in this five thousand metres 

Billy Dee the little Luton runner has gone in front now

Eamonn Martin in second place then Rob Denmark third

Looks like Bristow still on the inside

There 's going to be a tremendous scramble over the last three laps here

John Nuttall has moved up as well in the blue vest there into about fifth place

And uh there 's been a lot of changes of leadership and no significant break as yet Steve



No Billy Dee is a tough little competitor though

He 'll take it up hard over these last three laps  but uh he 's not got the sort of calibre I don't think to burn off some of the people behind him 

Rob Denmark there on the shoulder of Eamonn Martin number twenty-one  has really got a blistering finish if it 's a slow race and uh Eamonn has also got a bit of a kick

But looking back there is number eleven Ian Hamer

He 's coming through

This is really building up to quite a climax over this last two laps  and they really are starting to pile it on here



Another interesting character to watch there is Paul Davis-Hale a marathon runner  number six

He 's uh surprised us all

Sometimes in these type of races he 's got a withering kick  but I don't know whether he 's going to get up and move up with these boys

This is quite an intriguing race

Two to go 

Billy Dee still leads

Eamonn Martin in second place then Rob Denmark is third 

Muddleston has dropped back now having led uh for a couple of laps 

John Nuttall still up there in third place now 

Then Denmark 

Then Ian Hamer fourth 

Andy Bristow in fifth

and Paul Davis-Hale now that Jack Butler in fact has moved back again

It 's intriguing this because uh they keep swapping places like musical chairs and at the end of it only one of them will be left sitting down and that 'll be the one who 'll be sitting on the plane to Tokyo 

fifty to go

They 're all starting to gather themselves

I saw as they went down the back straight people blowing their noses adjust adjusting themselves dropping their s uh  a little bit to relax their legs

Look at them all coming up now to the bell

Billy Dee up front is really doing the best he can

but it 's not going to be good enough I don't think to hold off some of these big boys behind

Watch out for a big a big big last lap and some of the very fast finishers in this group 

It 's Dee then Martin

Denmark moving up as well in third

And Nuttall is fourth

And Hamer just behind them number eleven  in fifth 

Into the lead goes John Nuttall the Preston athlete sixth in last year  and ran the ten thousand metres and failed to finish in fact when that championship was held back in June

This will be some consolation indeed for him if he can make it

Eamonn Martin holding on for second 

Hamer looking good in fourth

so too is Denmark in third 

Nuttall is tiring

Eamonn Martin comes to the top 

Eamonn Martin leads Rob Denmark second Ian Hamer third going into the final straight

It 'll be between these three

Denmark coming hard on Eamonn Martin 

Eamonn Martin is holding him off

A fantastic finish here  and Eamonn Martin wins it 

Denmark second 

Hamer third

The winning time thirteen thirty-three

Now that 's interesting  to say the least because Eamonn Martin is already going to Tokyo in the ten thousand metres

and the British board have  said quite definitely that they will not allow athletes to double

so although he 's won that championship he can't claim his place over five thousand metres

Well it 's only a heat at the national championships 

and when you 've won every major medal in the sport and held the world record nerves shouldn't be a problem

but Steve Cram here will be as edgy as a raw beginner

It 's only his second track race of the summer  and it 's going to give him a very big clue about his chances of making Britain 's team for the world championships later this year

Steve Cram  in the famous yellow vest has gone in behind the early leader Mark Kirk here in this heat of the fifteen hundred metres 

The first three home and then two fastest losers  will be guaranteed places in tomorrow 's final

A total of fifty-two athletes altogether taking part in the fifteen hundred metre heats 

Well Steve Cram  ran last weekend in a northern league match  clocked a time of three minutes forty-two

Routine of course for him  when you consider he 's held the world record and still  holds the second fastest time ever 

But a big encouragement to him an indication that that knee problem was finally going away and that he was at least approaching something like real fitness if not the form we know he 's capable of



That was a great shot from Mike 

And certainly the balls are there  available for Mike if he can just hold his nerve but uh it 'd be a great clearance especially to win the match 





And anxious moments now for Steven 

And now







Steven can't do a thing about it 

Now then 

And dare I suggest that that is the uh the match-winner 

Mm

Balls very nicely situated here 

And Mike slowing down  just  getting himself together 

There 's one hundred thousand pounds on the line here 

So twenty-one points behind

and twenty-two remaining 

Again rather tentative

Maybe a little bit of elbow in that 

And how anxious now is Steven 

Big shot 

Now just look at this 

Now has it got away 

Well the cheer goes up  and Steven Hendry pulls another one back

It is now eight frames to three











So now  can he keep his cool and really  make his mark here

Excellent chance 



Yes

And this isn't the kind of shot uh  that is particularly appealing when you 're  just a  couple of reds and a colour away from virtually certain victory 

And again he hit it  at uh  quite a rate of knots

Certainly he knew that was the possible winning one 

Now Steven Hendry knows that this could possibly be his last chance and uh taking every precaution 

The red on the side cushion seems to be the only  particularly  awkward ball 

And he can drop right behind it on this one 





And I think he probably got down a bit  too quickly there

He could  On reflection he may well 've thought that uh the blue would have been a better choice of shot

but 

Now can Mike Hallet  take his chance this time 







So from seven nil down from eight two down Steven Hendry comes all the way back to eight all 

And it 's all on the last 

Well it sometimes happened that happens that when you 've uh gone past the point of no return you 've  you relax

you can't go any further back than you have been 

And that opening red from Mike  was a great shot but uh  that wasn't so good 





And I 'm rather surprised at Steven taking that one on 

Wanted a fine contact to knock the black in

and uh sure to leave Mike half a chance to the middle 





A little too far  for ideal position on the blue 

Can't easily get the cue ball towards his next red 

Disappointing though 

He hit the red sharply but  no potable red has come out 

The gods are making it hard for him as well as his opponent 



Well Steven knew that unless he got the cue ball behind the green he was going to leave  Mike a chance of the cut 

Well that is cruel  and uh one has to feel very sorry for Mike Hallet 

Still he 's thirty points in front 

He 's just got to uh  forget it and hope he gets another chance 





And that was a great shot 

He may not be taking the pot on 



Sure to contact the yellow so uh 

Putting Mike Hallet in a spot of bother 

And cueing 's very awkward with the yellow there so  Mike has to be very careful this time 





Yes

I think two or three safety shots has uh helped Mike to calm down a little

He was getting  lots of chances  and now that uh  little piece of luck that 's  been lacking  in the last two or three frames 





Well if this was the first frame of the match Clive I 'd fancy Mike to knock this red in the middle but uh 

Oh it 's he 's got a choice of two

but both  very awkward 

Possibly even one to the left middle as well

but  he knows that missing any one of those three  could cost him 



And another  great red from uh  Mike Hallet and position this time 

But not on this red 

So this  frame looks destined to go all the way 





It is yes it 's it 's it 's rather unfortunate

I i It had cleared up a bit but the drizzle has started again

As we 're all standing out here and there are there are reporters from from all over the world here  uhm a gathering of of of uh a very large number of cameramen  and uh reporters and photographers

Now I can hear the sound of an aircraft

I think I can hear the sound of an aircraft  uh in the distance  and I think they 're about to come in to land

I 'm just going to try and get myself a better better vant vantage point because I 'm sort of staring over the side of a building and all I can see is bricks at the moment



The The uh R A F Puma helicopter is just coming in  uh uh uh and has landed here

and it 's just taxiing  to the the runway where it will find its position where it will stop

I hope you can hear me above the sound

It 's just coming to a stop now  and uh uh any second now the Secretary General will leave this  leave the helicopter uh accompanied by the Foreign Office minister Douglas

Shortly afterwards uh John McCarthy 's car will draw up

 uh the rotor blades have now been switched off 

and uh any second now the Secretary  leaving leaving the helicopter







Doors open

coming down  and  it 's difficult for me to see from where exactly where I am

Somebody 's getting off a security man or whatever uh and uh the Secretary General seconds

I can't from where I 'm from where I 'm standing see that car that McCarthy

The General 's now come down the steps  behind him Douglas Hogg commander as they arrive at R A F Lyneham

and I expect any moment they 'll be departing from the V I P suite which is where John McCarthy is waiting at the moment to to Perez De Cuellar

And the car has now come out the car with John uh inside

and it is uh approaching approaching the aircraft actually stops now

and I think he 's going to walk the last bit 

Uhm and the Secretary General are walking towards the press here uh away from away from their aircraft

There 's a whole number of cars

I 'm not actually sure

oh

no

I can now see John McCarthy uh dressed in a blazer  and a blue shirt from a quite above the head of all these photographers and whatever

but



It must have been the first time he 's had that on for quite a few years 

and uh he is carrying this famous letter that the whole world is waiting to see the contents of 

It looks almost like something you get on Her Majesty 's service

It 's in a  it 's a brown uh quite a large foolscap sized envelope brown

He 's carrying it in his left hand

He 's walking down the runway now 



That 's right

seen the Secretary

As you say a brown envelope which he 's about to hand to Javier Perez De Cuellar

Just now he 's touched the Secretary General is touching McCarthy on the shoulder exchanging a few words

Hogg standing beside the two men 

The envelope still at the moment hands although

uh no

yes

he 's just about

He 's John is still holding the the uh

Ah we seem to have lost James there but never mind

we can continue to tell you what 's happening here 

John McCarthy is standing now with

He now is handing the letter to the U N Secretary General 

They 're both holding on to it

John seems almost reluctant to let go

He 's probably had it for quite a few days  but he 's now handed it over

Uh they 're taking this a a number of photographs

It is now in the hands of The U N Secretary General

The two of them are continuing to talk 

On the left of the Secretary General is the uh  junior minister at the Foreign Office uh Douglas Hogg uh uhm who is there looking after things for the Foreign Office 

The two of them are standing together

John McCarthy looking a little bit pale this morning

but it 's quite cold out there uh

and uh he 's only got a jacket on  uh

and it 's quite windy too

And uh this is the letter that the U N Secretary General has been given uh by John McCarthy

It has been presented to him on behalf of uh John McCarthy 's kidnappers

and it is expected to contain the demands of Islamic Jihad  uhm as to what they expect the West to do now in return for the release of further host of further hostages





About two seconds before the handover of the envelope my vodaphone ran out of batteries 

but I am now back with you on another phone

Uh the uh Secretary General Douglas Hogg and John McCarthy are now walking to the V I P suite uh where they 'll have as I said private discussions for about forty minutes or so  and then they will come out again

Uh certainly the Secretary General will come out and as I said earlier John McCarthy will probably come out as well

Whether he speaks or not remains to be seen

Two laps to go then for Steve

and the rest of the field still being led through by Mark Kirk 

Andrew Geddes in third place wearing number twenty-eight 

Steve Cram Olympic silver medallist at this distance

World champion back in nineteen eighty-three  twice the European twice the Commonwealth champion 

Former world record holder

Still holds the world record for the mile  but that knee injury he suffered after a very good few weeks training in Boulder in the United States of America has really hampered his season

So they reach the bell

and remember

only the first three are guaranteed a place in the final plus two fastest losers 

but Steve Cram will not want to sit around and uh do the calculations

He 'll want to make absolutely sure he goes through by right

James Starling from Southampton still leading 

Steve Cram in second place

Ian Grime moving up into third number thirty-four

And Steve Cram in that familiar position of leader at the two hundred metre mark  where so often famously over the years he 's kicked away from world-class fields and left them for dead and won the big medals 

Oozing through this time as Kevin McKay follows him through in second place

He looks over his shoulder to make sure  there 's no threat to his position in the first three 

He needn't worry

A very satisfactory exercise for Steve Cram

Three forty-two the winning time

Kevin McKay comes through into second place and then James Starling was third

Yes tremendous atmosphere here now 

Gary Mason and Lennox Lewis squaring up to each other threateningly in the ring beforehand

All the build-up 's over

All the talking 's stopped now

Larry O'Connell calls them together

They 're on opposite sides of the ring

It 's due to go twelve rounds

Will it go that far 

Mason  against Lewis for the British and European heavyweight title

The first bell goes and they 're under way and they get into an untidy maul straight away 

Referee in there is Larry O'Connell fifty-two very experienced top-class

Cautious beginning

Lewis tries to dig in a couple of lefts and again they get into an untidy maul early on

No real significant punches thrown

Mason  eight pounds heavier at sixteen stone eleven 

Lewis trying to get out his jab in the early stages only landing on the gloves of Mason who stalks him across the ring

Tries to land a left to the body 

And that almost went and strayed a little bit low

and there 's a cautionary word from referee Larry O'Connell early on about that

Mason  is the victim there as Lewis tries to throw out a right and then gets back to work with his jab

Good punch there from Lewis

little left hook and then a right uppercut inside 

Good work from the European champion and a r right to the head 

Mason close in as they hold on trying to land rights to the body

But that was a good little opening flurry from Lennox Lewis getting into gear

Again the referee has to have a cautionary word with him

Splits them up

Back to work in the centre of the ring again Lewis using his outstanding reach and fast hands to throw out the jabs and then picking off Mason with a right to the head

And at this stage Mason just looking  noticeably slower  although Lewis isn't really getting on his bike at all

He 's standing there in front of  Mason and poking out his jab measuring him for size with it 

Doesn't land with it this time

Again he gets a warning this time about holding on behind the head

does Lennox Lewis

Don't pull Mason onto the punches

says referee Larry O'Connell who intends to take a very strict hand with both of these two 

So much at stake here

Both with world title aspirations 

Lewis having the better of the opening round so far looking confident almost arrogant dancing this way and that good lateral movements for him poking out his jab 

Mason  with a roundhouse right into the side of the body of Lewis but Lewis  making the more impressive start of these two

The twenty-five-year-old Lewis the twenty-eight-year-old Mason 

Only the fifteenth fight

A right to the head there

Good punch that from Mason his best yet in between the gloves of Lewis

Then he followed it up with a couple of body shots

Minute to go in the opening round 

Mason working steadily

He thinks he can take control of this in the later stages

He 's going to pace it

Walks in then and almost walks on right on to a right uppercut from  Lewis and it was lucky that didn't land more powerfully

It was a good shot

There seems to be  a good repertoire about Lewis

He pokes out his jab again skips backwards

Nice boxing skills from him  in this opening round

It 's been an impressive start from him and he lands with another  combination to the head 

Mason  trying to get in

He 's often looked a bit predictable and ponderous at times in his career

but he always gets the job done

Mason

And he gets caught with another right then

just blinked a bit as that landed 

And Lewis is rather quick on his feet as Mason tried to trap him in the corner there

Got out of trouble  and Lewis has been in charge in this opening round

Spears out his left jab again into the face of Mason once twice

Mason again tries to get him on the ropes but Lewis is too fast for him

Bounces off those ropes back into the centre of the ring 

And Mason does land with his jab and his supporters respond to that 

And then he gets in with a left to the body as well

then a right to the body

and then a good right back from Lewis  as they talk to each other rather acrimoniously at the end of that first round which on my scorecard I 'd have given to Lennox Lewis











First blood to Lewis

but this plot has a long way to run yet

Second round coming up

Due to go twelve  for the British and European heavyweight title 

A right over the top from Lewis into the head of Mason right at the start of the round

Pokes out his jab once two three times but only into the gloves of Mason who covers up well

That one got through just jolted Mason 's head back on his shoulders a bit 

Again Lewis has stepped up a gear at the start of this round 

And you get the impression that he rather fancies the job in these early stages 

But Mason make no mistake  is looking slimmer and more better condition but just a little bemused there as that jab  came thudding through his guard again and into the face

some of the jabs landing on the gloves one or two getting through

Then he works to the body

Mason then wants to go to war with him close in 

Gets him with a couple of rights to the head in that exchange

and Lewis would do well not to get involved in any close-quarter brawling because he 's got this superior height and reach advantage and looks good when he 's working behind the jab

Poked in the left of the head that time 

Lewis is  made to miss this time and Mason comes back with a counter to the body 

Lennox Lewis though has never been beyond eight rounds

walking almost confidently arrogantly with gloves held down by his side over on the far side

then re-engages Mason in action

Mason tries to land a couple to the body 

and then Lewis with a sharp right to the head

and Mason made to look a little slow again as he missed but got in with a  stiff looking left jab this time landing on the body of Lewis 

Lewis with a kind of half smile playing around his lips  and just dropping off his work rate a bit in this second round after that fast start to it 

Poking out his jab again as Mason tries to  close him down on the ropes and  turn it into something  more close-quarterish than we 've had so far

And again Lewis with his jab

It 's a good one

The former Olympic champion  looking classy in these opening stages 

But will Mason 's  probable superior power come into play and wear him down late on

Fascinating fight

Only the second round

That 's a good jab from Mason 

thudded into the head this time of Lennox Lewis

And again 

And Mason follows it up this time with an attempted right to the body

They get into a maul

Minute to go in round two 

Crowd at Wembley absolutely absorbed in this one

We 've been waiting for so long for it

It 's not let us down so far

Combinations to the head this time from Lewis 

right and left then another jab

And Mason walked onto that one on the way in 

And he 's going to have trouble

And this time he gets him with a right

Mason

And Lewis gave him a look as if to say

didn't hurt me at all

stood his ground

but it was a good right from Mason to the head 

Trying to score with the jab

but Lewis using his mobility and good footwork to get out of range of it  over on the far side of the ring from me

We 're right at ringside by the way about two feet away from the ropes

Great view of it under the arc lights here at the Wembley Arena if you can picture the scene at home

Good body shots there

and one of them straying a little bit low

and Mason getting a warning from referee Larry O'Connell

No point deducted or anything like that

Mason comes back to work and lands with a left jab

He 's scored once or twice with that in this round

couple of times to the head and body

Had a few more successes than he did in the first

but Lewis keeps on spearing that jab

And as if to emphasise the point right at the end of the round  fires home two more





He 's had a diet so far of fairly modest opposition of course

Lennox Lewis

The big question is about his resilience and chin if it goes a long way 



So many questions not very many answers but no doubt about it a pretty good start here from Lennox Lewis

But we thought it might be like that

The third round 

Mason giving the impression  that he may be just biding his time

But Lewis has started confidently not to say arrogantly and throws out that jab again at the start of round three

It 's been  very much the  dominant punch so far and it 's thrown with good speed as well so that Mason is rarely able to slip it

And again that jab comes in

Mason skipping backwards showing a bit more mobility than I 've seen of him sometimes in his career

Gets in with a nice little sneak right to the body

Made Lewis kind of fall backwards off balance into the ropes

He wasn't hurt or anything

But that 's a good right to the head from Mason who starts to have noticeably more success

Back comes Lewis again with a jab this time 

And there 's a little bit of a swelling by the right eye  of Gary Mason 

Only a swelling so far underneath the eye

They 'll have to watch that

The jab goes out again and that jab is starting to have an effect on the face of Mason 

Just a hint of a swelling starting

and if the eye closes he 's in big big trouble 

This is only the third round

Untidy maul at close quarters over on the far side 

Good little left there though hook to the head from Gary Mason

They 're working close again

And again that jab comes out from Lewis once twice 

And he 's looking quite a class act is Lewis

but he mustn't get careless  because Mason might make him pay for it

And Mason does score with some punches as they work close in

Mason having his best successes when they work close but he 's made to miss by a long way 

Body shots from Mason who 's going for it a bit in this round  trying to step it up

He 's closed him down and gets through with a body shot again 

Back comes Lewis with two jabs it 's really three-or-four-words

it 's really three-or-four-words

Now blood coming from over the eye of Mason

That eye is in a bad shape 

And we 're only in the third round

It 's beginning to open up and there 's blood there as well now 

Well it would be such a shame if a cut eye was going to decide this fight 

We really want one of them to win in an exciting fashion

Lewis tries to score with a right uppercut

Only lands on the gloves

Just breathing deeply

Missed rather embarrassingly there

did Lewis

That was sloppy from him and he looked a bit amateurish as he did that 

He 's really only a n novice still as a professional

Only fifteen fourteen fights behind him 

Clubbing right to the side of head

That  l right eye of Mason 's is bad

There 's blood coming from oven over the top of the eye

It 's swollen underneath 

And the corner are going to have to get to work on it

The Soviet Union in possession then halfway inside their own half

It 's with Vasili Khulkov who plays the ball back to Galiamin

and then it comes out to the near side to the  long haired left back Shalimov

He plays it back towards the edge of his own penalty area

Picked up now by  Chernishkov who wears the number two shirt but plays in more of a central position

He plays a one-two with Svaba at the back

and then it 's back out to the left-hand side to Chernishkov

Chip forward across the halfway line

Soviets pushing men forward

Shalimov unable to pick up on the lay off

and the ball runs across the touch line for a throw-in 











The Soviets pushing forward with Polivanov at the moment trying to get it out from the far side to Kanchelskis

Good interception coming in from Enrique at the back 





















Soviets trying to push it forward at the moment with the distinguishable blond haired figure of Michalichenko

He 's been forced all the way to the back to the halfway line

Still manages to hold on to the ball in spite of pressure from Basualdo

And then as Franco closed in on him he got it back to Chernishkov and he gives the Soviet goalkeeper Cherchesov another early feel of the ball

Soviets pushing forward again

This time it 's Kulkov who chips it forward

gets it returned to him rather carelessly and the Soviet

and uh Soviet Union 's been forced back inside their own half now as the ball breaks to the far side

The shot comes in

It goes straight across the face of the goal

Carlos  Alfero Moreno got away then was put clear by Garcia  moved in from the left edge of the penalty area chipped at the shot and went straight across the face of the goal

















Dobrovolski getting away on the left-hand side gets in the cross

and Kalivanov gets in the first real good effort of the evening

A good run that by Dobrovolski down the left-hand side

The cross into the middle

And Kalivanov Igor Kalivanov was about eight yards out from goal

He 's been injured in the challenge that came on him as he got in the left-footed shot which just went to the left of Goycochea 's goal

He 'll receive treatment for that

But a good opening for the Soviet team



























We should say of course that uh England have Argentina to face on Saturday having already faced and beaten the Soviet Union

But it 's Argentina at the moment who 're moving forward with Simeone who gets the ball out to the far side to Alfero Moreno

He 's got Garcia in the middle

But he 's run it on too far that time

He was being pressured well by Andrei Chernishkov at the back

And it runs across the by-line for a goal kick to the Soviet Union 

Stanislav  Cherchesov takes it  short to Chernishkov on his right and he plays a short ball forward to Khulkov as the Soviets look to build from the back

It 's now with Michalichenko who chips a long ball forward deep into the Argentine half

Headed down by Kolivanov

but it only breaks for the Argentinian team now

and they break and play the one-two with Franco

And  some good ground has been made up here by Enrique

Tries to play the one-two with Alfero Moreno

It didn't quite work

And the Soviets fail to clear the ball at the first attempt

Do so at the second attempt

It 's flicked on by Mostovoi and then Basualdo picks it up for Argentina

Scoops the ball up into the air

It 's headed down now

An opportunity for Visconti if he can get the opening

But it breaks to the right now

And Garcia lines up the shot

And it 's off the target and a flag was up on the near side anyway 











Simeone is pushing forward dangerously now towards the edge of the penalty area

He was outnumbered in the end and it breaks to the Soviet left

It 's with  Shalimov who plays the ball into the centre

And it 's picked up now by Svaba who crosses the halfway line pulls to the right of the centre circle plays it forward long

Kalivanov found space again on the edge of the penalty area

He was being pressured by Basualdo and he ran it on just too far

And Argentina now break with Visconti who crosses the halfway line

Moves into the Soviet half

He 's got Garcia to his right

He uses Simeone to his left

Tries to play the ball through to the middle

It comes back to Simeone

Again he fails to get it through

It bounces back off Svaba

Picked up now by Estrada for Argentina who plays it out to the near side

Garcia was coming under pressure there

Loses out and Khulkov picks it up

A hefty challenge in on him

and Argentina have possession back now

It 's Garcia the long haired number seven trying to cut into the middle

Brought down by Khulkov

Free kick to Argentina thirty yards from goal 

















Fourteen minutes gone then

Nil nil

The free kick whipped in by Simeone

Michalichenko 's up there with a header away

In comes Enrique to drive the ball right-footed 

High he lofts it over the top

And the flag was up again on the uh near side

So with fourteen minutes gone the scoreline still Argentina nil the Soviet Union  nil

Argentina  under new management since the world cup

Carlos Bilardo has gone and Alfi Basil is now in charge here

And he  made it clear from the start he intended to change the  Argentines ' policy playing policy

So they are setting a better example for the many school children that we  have here in the crowd certainly at uh this stage

Quarter of an hour gone then

No score

And the Soviet Union have a throw-in halfway inside their own half

It 's to be taken  by Shalimov  down that left-hand touch line trying to set Dobrovolski away

He goes down under a challenge from Basualdo which is perfectly legal according to our Danish referee Mr Mickelson

So the Soviets have it back now with Shalimov on the left

Plays it across the halfway line there

Neat little back heel from Kolivanov

and picked up now by Michalichenko who 's found space down the centre

Dobrovolski now from the edge of the area

Got it on his left foot

Tried to play it on to his right foot

Scooped it over that foot in the end and made a hash of a possible half chance

And Argentina now break down that left hand side

And again it 's the little man Alfero Moreno who 's got it

Plays it forward to Franco who 's tackled by Chernishkov

And Chernishkov gets the ball back from Khulkov and pushes up towards the halfway line level with the end of the centre circle

Bad ball forward

Cut out by Ostrada

but his ball forward is too long for Alfero Moreno

and at the back is Khulkov to tidy up to give Cherchesov another touch







Garcia is pushing forward well

He 's coming under strong pressure from  Dobrovolski who 's helping out his defence and in the end gets a little too frustrated  with the uh Argentine 's progress and hacks down his man resulting in a free kick for Argentina right on the left edge of the penalty area 

So the Soviets pull men back in numbers

They 've only left Kolivanov forward at this stage

Meanwhile Argentina have pushed five men into the eighteen yard box while the Soviet Union have formed a three man wall

The free kick is taken a little too hastily

And while the shot does come in from Vasquez referee Mickelson unhappy about how quickly the kick was taken

So Simeone will now get  another opportunity to  chip the ball into the middle

Plenty of men forward

Visconti is forward

So too is  Ruggeri the captain

Simeone it is who chips the ball in

And it 's just touched over the top of the crossbar is it 

I think there may 've been a foul in there as the free kick was played in

The goalkeeper certainly got a touch just under his crossbar































The Soviets playing a nice bit of football at the back

It 's with Dobrovolski now just inside the centre circle and only a yard or two inside his own half

Saw the danger of Simeone approaching so he plays the ball back and then gets it back from Svaba and plays it out to the near side to Shalimov

He plays Khulkov into a bit of danger but Svaba at the back tidies up plays it forward

Franco 's there for Argentina to knock it forward

Simeone is unable to bring it under control and Mostovoi and Chernishkov between them tidy up

Chernishkov in the end plays the ball forward to Galiamin who 's eight yards inside his own half

He plays the ball out to that far side to Polivanov who is tackled  unfairly by Franco

So the referee has a word with him and the free kick is quickly taken

And Chernishkov now plays it to Khulkov who 's inside the centre circle

Just pulls out to the left a bit now then goes back inside crosses the centre spot then plays the ball out to the right hand side to Galiamin just inside his own half

It 's across the halfway line now

Kolivanov flicks the ball on to Michalichenko

Back now to Kolivanov pushing up towards the edge of the penalty area

Plays the ball through

It 's a lovely ball as well but Mostovoi 's first touch let him down

He took it on board but it ran on and Goycochea was out quickly to pounce on top of it 

Kolivanov has again made another good move forward which results in the ball coming back to Shalimov and then out to the near side to Kolivanov

Chipped up into the middle

It 's headed up into the air

Michalichenko 's trying to get underneath it

It 'll fall though for Galiamin who drives it in from twenty yards

It deflects back off his own man Michalichenko and then out to the far side to Khulkov

Right edge of the penalty area tries to play Galiamin in

Argentina are looking for the offside

The cross comes in anyway

It 's not going to fall for Kolivanov

It will fall for Shalimov who 's just a little way out from goal but still  trying to persistently force the ball through

It 's to Dubrolsky in the end who plays it through

Mostovoi is offside

Flag up immediately on the far side 

The Soviet Union thought they 'd got the goal there

and Kolivanov is still unhappy about the uh linesman and the referee 's decision

The Argentine team are in possession now inside their own half

And the ball is now with Simeone who plays it back  to Ruggeri the captain of the team here tonight

He squares the ball to his right to Sergeo Vasquez who 's in a lot of space halfway inside his own half

Plays the ball across the halfway line

Chernishkov 's there for the Soviet Union and Khulkov then heads the ball back to Cherchesov in the goal to our right

We 're still in the last throes of daylight here at Old Trafford

The floodlights have been on from the start of the evening

A nice pleasant atmosphere but still no score

Argentina nil the Soviet Union nil

We 're at the midway point of the first half

take you through to half-time Alan Green

And now a moving moment

The first performance on parade  of a slow march called Nairac G C

It 's a tribute to an outstanding young officer of the Grenadiers a former pupil of Ampleforth who read modern history at Oxford and was commissioned in January nineteen seventy-three

Robert Nairac joined the Second Battalion Grenadier Guards whose colours have been trooped this morning did four tours of duty in Northern Ireland

and one night in May in nineteen seventy-seven was abducted from a village in South Armagh by seven men taken across the border

and there he was subjected to  savage assaults in an attempt to extract information from him

After several hours of brutality he was shot

Later his assassin said he told us nothing

In February nineteen seventy-nine Robert Nairac was awarded the George Cross posthumously 

His devotion to duty and personal courage were second to none

says the official citation 

His friends in the regiment remember still a very special young man of high intelligence great charm and genuine humility 

Now the march past breaks into quick time

The march is The Bond of Friendship

And we 've been very lucky so far with the weather although the skies have been so overcast

But during the slow march the stands with seven thousand people  among them you would 've been very lucky to get tickets for this great occasion

The stands mushroomed with coloured umbrellas suddenly being erected

A few spots of rain

I 'm sure to those who were marching past it 's only a refreshing  uh reminder and cooling to the brow 

And as each guard reaches the south-west corner they change arms moving the S A  Eighty rifle on the right shoulder to the left 

It 's so well done that you can hardly see it happen except that you suddenly notice that it 's the other arm that is swinging chest high 

The field officer and the major of the parade have once again halted more or less directly in front of the  equestrian statue of  Lord Roberts

The first four guards mark time and now move on to march past the Queen in quick time 

And uh  you can see the Prime Minister over there on his stand between the uh  Foreign Secretary and the Defence Secretary  and Douglas Hurd 

Now  the march past of the Grenadier Guards

The British Grenadiers of course 

The tune adopted by the regiment in eighteen fifteen the year of Waterloo 

Second Battalion Scots Guards combining numbers three or four guards march past to Hieland Laddie 

For the First Battalion of Welsh Guards The Rising of the Lark 

Numbers Seven and Eight Guards formed by the  and Coldstream Guards march past to their regimental slow march  written by Johann Valentine Hamm for the Milanova sisters Teresa and Maria 

The Queen  sits herself down again 

The field officer  Brigadier Braithwaite  rides  to face Her Majesty salutes with his sword  and rides away to take command of the parade again  as the quick march is The Thin Red Line 

So the fourth of the five parts of the parade comes to an end

And with the guards back in position 

And perhaps a sense of relief from the escort from the ensign Second Lieutenant Benedict Stevens on a well-executed parade

They must 've been worried last night and earlier this morning in a gusty wind

but uh it has looked immaculate as ever as the guards now resume their original positions and  mark time  the shiny boots rising and falling in  perfect harmony 

So quite a lot of orders there

The guard were halted and then called to shoulder arms

The officers  are now  quick-marching to their posts 

And there will then be the command given  to the guards to  in open order left and right dress  the final dressing of the parade 

And at the voice of Drum Major C D Ward the massed bands move to the right and march away now from the centre of the parade  as the Board of Drums

it 's only since nineteen sixty-one that the flutes of the Board of Drums were retuned so that they could play with the massed bands

play  Galantia 

And so the massed bands give way to the massed mounted bands fifty in numbers 

The uh two bands of the Household Cavalry regiments the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals have appeared in this parade together since nineteen seventy-one

They 're led by the Director of Music of the Life Guards

Captain Colin Reeves  experienced military musician joined the army thirty-one years ago

And he encountered the problem of conducting with one hand while holding the reins with the other eighteen months ago in December nineteen eighty-nine

Behind him the splendid drum horses

Drum horse of the Life Guards Hieronymous a piebald gelding  black and white that means  given to the regiment in March nineteen eighty-six by Her Majesty the Queen

His training took two to three years

He 's now ten

Stands sixteen hands two inches high

That 's about five feet six at the shoulder

The kettledrums that he carries are the silver drums given to the first Life Guards by William the Fourth on the twenty-third of July eighteen thirty-one  draped in the magnificent crimson and gold drum banners embroidered with the Royal Arms

And to his left is  the drum horse of the Blues and Royals Belisarius the Household Cavalry 's first Clydesdale drum horse

He is twelve now

Been with the regiment since he was born

Comes from Fife

Weighs nearly three quarters of a ton

but he 'd need to because the drums  priceless silver given to the Royal Horse Guards by George the Third on Saint George 's Day eighteen hundred and five weigh ninety-eight pounds each

That 's nearly a hundredweight

He 's called Basil in the stables  and I 'm told likes a pint of MacEwan 's with his feed 

The eight guards now present arms to honour the Sovereign 's Standard of the Household Cavalry 

As they prepare to  walk past Her Majesty the Queen five squadrons in review order

First of all the Life Guards slow march 

And behind the field  officer of the escort Major the Honourable Myles Hodgson of the Life Guards  comes the  standard bearer of the Sovereign 's Standard of the Life Guards 

He 's entered here on Horse Guard Parade on the nineteenth of May nineteen eighty-three 

The Royal Coat of Arms  twenty-seven battle honours of the regiment dating back to  in seventeen forty-three

Standard bearer squadron corporal Major Pickard

And the trumpeter on a grey  behind uhm the Coverer of Horse 

Now the first two divisions of the Life Guards  walk past Her Majesty the Queen

And what a wonderful sight they are  Life Guards ' scarlet tunics blue and gold facings white mesal metal cuirasses plumes of white  chinstrap worn under the lower lip like the chin stays of the word guard bearskins

And now  the Blues and Royals slow march 

The Third and Fourth Divisions of the Household Cavalry  by the Blues and Royals 

They  of course have  uh blue tunics  wear red  plumes  in their helmets

and both wear white cross-belts with red flash cords from which hang the  priming fuses for the old flintlocks

At the back of the cross-belt is the shiny polished cartouche-box which once held the main charges 

The guards slope arms 

The Household Cavalry  move off round in front of the Admiralty 

And in a few moments we will hear the trumpeter on his grey horse sound the command to trot 

And trumpeter  has just done that

and I don't think a spur is needed

The horses The old Irish black horses of the Household Cavalry know the sound of the trumpet and they immediately break into a trot themselves 

The name of this tune is Christ Church Bells 

And a tricky moment for uh Field Marshal the horse of the major of the parade standing at the right of the lion because he has to stand there stock-still while a hundred and ninety-eight  horses go trotting by

And I 'm sure he 'd like to be  with them

Once again the guards present arms to the Sovereign 's Standard of the Life Guards

As the Life Guards trot past to the regimental trot The Keel Row or as we say in Scotland the The Keel Row 

It was in nineteen hundred and six that the Queen 's great-grandfather King Edward the Seventh decreed that privates in the Household Cavalry should henceforth to be known as troopers

And uh  of course uh all troopers of the Household Cavalry on ceremonial occasions carry a drawn sword

And  at the rear of the  Blues and Royals the two farriers with their  shining axes

As the massed mounted bands  now leave the parade the Director of Music Captain Reeves salutes Her Majesty the two mounted drummers cross their drumsticks  eyes right from the rest of the mounted band in their wonderful golden tunics

The Household Division they wear these  Tudor coats in the presence of Her Majesty the Queen 

And so the fifth and last part of the birthday parade is almost completed the walk and trot past of the Household Cavalry

Included as an integral part of the parade for the first time in the first year of the Queen 's reign in nineteen fifty-two thirty-nine years ago 

That seems like yesterday afternoon in terms of the long pedigree that the seven regiments represented on parade

They have a total of well over eighteen hundred years of service to the Crown between them 

When the Sovereign 's Escort has come to a halt there  as they have now over in front of the Guards ' Memorial and the mounted bands too will halt where they are in front of the Old Admiralty Building  field officer Lieutenant Colonel Lyszinsky will give the command for the final royal salute of the parade the loyal birthday greetings of the whole Household Division to their Colonel-in-Chief Her Majesty the Queen 

In a few weeks the Fourteenth Household Division will be moving from Horse Guards here to a temporary home at Chelsea Barracks while Horse Guard 's building is completely refurbished 

It 's expected that the process will take approximately three years

So I imagine the scene will be a little different  next year 

And now the preparation for the march on

The field officer gives the command

Form three ranks 

And then  the guards will about turn  as the massed mounted bands now  move slowly along in front of the cabinet building  that extraordinary old citadel built in the nineteen forties during the war  as a command post

Concrete blocks

Used to be a regimental home but 

The eight bands will now form into close columns and divisions for the march off

Before nineteen seventy-six the guards formed into three divisions making as I well remember a very long column of twenty-four divisions so that the rear of the parade had quite a job to hear the mighty beat of the massed bands when the bands turned into The Mall

They were already at the Duke of York steps while the last divisions were at the Downing Street side of Horse Guards

The music played by the Royal Drums is  a tribute by drum major 

And as the guards form close column and quick march to their position the corps of drums plays Prussian Glory  as the eighth guards close up 

And while the corps was playing regimental Sergeant-Major Fairchild sheathed his sword

and uh an orderly brought out to him his pace stick

A pace stick is like a huge set of dividers

It can be used to measure out a parade ground or by deft twisting of the wrist it also measures the pace of the march

The regulation pace is thirty inches

The guards march at a hundred and sixteen paces to the minute

The guards have shouldered arms  and stand at ease as we see the Household Cavalry now  all assembled closely in the approach road

And the Field Officer Brigade waiting rides up to Her Majesty the Queen

He was not granted security for officer training when he joined the regiment in nineteen sixty-eight because of his Polish ancestry

It was as a Guardsman that he came to the Second Battalion which now he commands and eventually became a lance sergeant instructor at the Guards Depot

When he was finally accepted for Sandhurst he went on to win the Sword of Honour and has since served as an officer with every company of each battalion of the regiment

He assumed command of the second battalion in October last year

He salutes Her Majesty  informs her that the guards are ready to march off and trots back on horse's-name to  resume command of the parade

A remarkable story

and uh  a remarkably proud day this must be for this young colonel Gerald Vijinsky

And now the Household Cavalry moving off the approach road and along The Mall which means that the Queen Mother 's procession

She left the major general 's window to start the final royal salute of the parade

and she and the Princess of Wales and Prince Harry are on their way back to Buckingham Palace  in the barouche

The final sign that all is clear for the march off to begin will be when garrison Sergeant-Major Perry Mason of the Coldstream Guards somebody who is very easy for a commentator to pick out

He is just saluting now

He is six foot six inches in his stocking soles  and considerably more with shiny boots and tall bearskin on 

and he is the proud recipient this morning in the birthday honours list of an M B E which has delighted everybody here at

Well Andy Smith must be dotting somewhere between Silverstone and here because he 's just won the first heat in this C P L Homefire British Championship

Andy Smith the unattached rider who 's had a lot of problems getting a ride in Britain this year

He was transfer-listed by Bradford during the close season

He 's only ridden in qualifiers in the world long-track but he won both of those and he 's won the opening heat which has just taken place here

So Andy Smith off to a good start

Three points for him

He won it having been pressed out of the gate by Neil Collins

But having taken the first bend well Smith was never really in trouble after that

So Neil Collins finished second

He picks up two points

Richard Knight the Berwick rider finished third in the opening heat

He took uh one point

And Steve Schofield who won the other British semi-final to take place at Craigly Heath he 's made a disappointing start

He was fourth in that opening ride so no points for him after the opening of this uh British final



In fact they 're thirteen point four two nine seconds in front of Egbert Strohe and Paul Groidle

and they really do look like they 're on course with those fingers crossed for their third successive Grand Prix victory

It started a marvellous race between Alan Michal and Steve Webster uh from the start line

Webster though took the lead on lap six and then on lap nine their great rivals the current world champions Alan Michal and Simon Birchall slowed up pointing to the rear of their machine and unfortunately they had to retire with mechanical problems

And this really left the way open for Webster to pull away from his pursuers

Even better news for British fans

Steve Abbott and Sean Smith are in sixth place in sorry in fourth place

in fifth place Darren and Sean Dixon

Barry Brinley also doing very well in seventh place

But with seven laps remaining keep those fingers crossed

Steve Webster and Gavin Simmons comfortably lead the Italian Grand Prix

Well we 've now completed fifty-six of the eighty-three laps

and Jaguar still leading

and their lead has been extended

There was a brilliant just over what an hour and uh forty minute stint by the little Italian Tio Fabi who had such uh great success in formula one and in indy-cart racing in America in the last uh few years

Now an integral member of the Jaguar team over here and he 's driven brilliantly

Of the fifty-six laps he led every single one of them and uh brought the car in with a two minute lead which was immediately extended when the Peugeot of Keki Rosberg eventually packed up

That had suffered with a misfire which eventually proved in incurable and that expired and was pushed to the back of the pits

So the Peugeot challenge is just about finished

And uh it now seems as though it 's going to come from Mercedes last year 's world champions

The Wendlinger car number two still running perfectly but o already over a lap and an extra two minutes down on the Jaguar of Tio Fabi

At the wheel for these last thirty laps or so will be Joe Bloggs Britain 's favourite racing driver of course

And it looks as though he is going to secure a brilliant win at Silverstone for Jaguar on their home track

Yes

Andy Smith was the man who won the opening heat here

The second heat was won by Gary Havelock

We 're at the moment just about to start or restart the third heat

It was delayed because on the last bend of the first lap of this circuit here at Brandon David Mullet clipped the back of Alan Graham 's wheel

He 's had to replace his clutch lever

uh Mullet has been excluded so three riders are now at the restart

And we 'll just see how they go out of the gate



He 's just pulling in on the inside

And going round on the outside of him is Paul Thorpe

And the white helmet of the Bradford rider it is that takes up the lead

And disappointingly for Graham who was leading the first race when it was uh run he 's now at the back in third place and seemingly only heading for one point

At the moment it 's Paul Thorpe who 's heading for the maximum three points from this race

Sean Wilson a former Coventry rider now with Bradford he 's in second place at the moment but Thorpe is looking unassailable in the lead

Four laps of the circuit remember

They 'll go and take the yellow flag  which will indicate now that they 're on the last lap

They take that yellow flag now

And it 's Thorpe who 's in the lead

In second place is Wilson in the blue helmet

And Alan Graham the man who had to replace that uh clutch lever because of the incident in the first race he 's at the back

They move now into the final bend

and it 's Thorpe who takes the three points Wilson who takes two

Alan Graham disappointingly trudges in to take just one point

The big news from the second heat here though was that Kelvin Tatum a former Coventry rider and last year 's winner of the British final only picked up one point finishing behind Gary Havelock and Mark Lawrum

So only four riders now haven't ridden

Martin Dewguard Joe Screen Jeremy Doncaster and John Davis are out in the next heat

And the winners so far Andy Smith Gary Havelock and Paul Thorpe

Into the first bend

It 's Smith on the outside who 's vying for the lead with Doncaster

but whipping up on the inside is Louis who was excluded in his previous race

remember

And it 's Louis who has taken up the lead from Doncaster at the moment

And Andy Smith who won his previous race is currently struggling at the back

So Chris Louis son of John Louis leads after the first lap

In second place is Jeremy Doncaster just one point from his previous ride

He 's been a little inconsistent this season

has Doncaster

but he 's certainly hoping to qualify and would have been one of the pre-race favourites to win it

At the moment he 's struggling in second place in this race

And it looks as though Louis has got it sewn up already

But the big disappointment is going to be really for Andy Smith

He won his semi-final to get him to this stage of the competition

He won his opening race here but he 's now struggling at the back

He 's pushing Doncaster all the way but Doncaster 's having none of it and certainly there 's going to be no doubt about the winner

As they come into the final bend now it 's going to be Chris Louis who takes the chequered flag

In second place is Jeremy Doncaster

In third place a disappointing single point for Andy Smith

Yes

It 's just about reaching a close now

and uh Joe Bloggs who took over this car after fifty-six of the eighty-three laps has piloted it home to victory

This is a really big home win for Jaguar and indeed for Silverstone because the Jaguar boss Tom Walkenshaw is of course the uh managing director of Silverstone Circuits the B R D C

So this is a home win in a big way

Joe bringing the car home this Jaguar number four very gently through the new curves which have been built in the Woodcutt section of the track  and uh sweeping round in front of this crowd of round about thirty to forty thousand

Over the start and finish line

and the Jaguar crew in front of us every single one to a man raises his fist to the skies in delight

Jaguar 's suc second successive win in the World Sports-Car Championship

and they 've finished ahead of Mercedes

The Mercedes number two car is going to come home a lap down and a few minutes adrift as well

but making second place

so valuable points for them

But the good news too for Jaguar is that Martin Brundle in one stint after losing seven laps at the very start of the whole race has actually brought that car up from last to third

And so more valuable constructors ' points for Jaguar in the chase for the championship at the end of the season

And this of course a first and a third for Jags

A great morale boost as they go to Le Mans next month to defend their one two title there

So Joe Bloggs the winner

He 's taken the chequered flag

Ch It 's uh the Mercedes of Wendlinger that comes home in second place

Across start and finish now

There 's the chequered flag for him

And Martin Brundle will bring Jaguar number three home in third place

Great victory for Joe Bloggs

Good to see him back on the rostrum again

And here in the sunshine at Coventry Gary Havelock has just maintained his unbeaten record

Nine points now from three rides

But he was extremely lucky in a sense in heat number nine the one just to have taken place because Richard Knight led from the gate until two and a quarter laps and then he fell and Havelock who at that stage was in second place roared into the lead to take three points from that ride nine overall

Sean Wilson in second place took two points

He 's now on a total of four

And third place in that race went to John Davis his first point of the afternoon

Now Paul Thorpe is the other unbeaten rider at this stage

He 's got six points from two rides and he comes out in heat number eleven

Coming up next is heats heat number ten which features David Mullet the Reading rider who has one point so far from his two rides

All of these riders have uh had two rides so far Mark Leram who has two points Jeremy Doncaster who has three and Steve Schofield who has yet to score

So we 're lined up for heat number ten

The start marshall has seen all four riders at the start

Mullet going off gate one

Leram off two

Doncaster with the white cap off gate three

And Steve Schofield remember still to rescord record his first points of the afternoon

he is in the outside gate in gate number four

And the start marshall who is kitted out in a very colourful outfit he 's got a a blue left sleeve a red left half to his outfit a right half and a white sleeve

so a really multicoloured marshall he is

and he 's unhappy at the moment about the position that Mark Leram the Kings Lynn rider is taking up

He 's got all four of them now waiting at the start tape looking for the light that 'll set them on their way

And the tapes will be sent up by the referee in the box just above the start

They 're roaring up at the start now and they go into the first bend

Doncaster got a bad start there and it 's Leram who moves into the lead although he 's tussling all the way with Mullet

And Mullet and Leram are really having a neck and neck battle

And it 's Leram who takes it now in the bend coming back into the home straight

He 's steered a little bit wide there but he 's just managed to hold on to the advantage

So Leram has the lead

Mullet is in second place but he 's battling with Doncaster and Schofield to hold on to it

And in fact Doncaster has moved up on the inside of him and Mullet has fallen

And the race may have to be stopped here

Leram it is who 's holding on to the lead

No sign of the red flags at this stage

but I think that Mullet 's fall is going to cause the race to be stopped

Indeed it is

And medical attention will immediately go out to the rider who fell there calling the causing the stoppage of that race Mullet

I 've a feeling he may well be uhm excluded from the re-run of the race and that we may only see three riders out for the re-run of heat ten

So Kent after being put in to bat have just four more balls to try and boost their score further than the hundred and seventy-four for seven that it is at the moment

So it 's been an innings of fits and starts when they 've uh a couple of times looked to promise more  runs

But a hundred and seventy-four for seven is certainly not too bad a score

In comes Pringle bowling this last over

Bowls it to Richard Ellison who hooks him down over deep square leg

and it goes through the hands of Stevenson who ran off the boundary

Now if he 'd stayed back a few paces he might just possibly have taken that uh  catch

but he didn't

and it bounced over his head behind him into the fence

Four runs to Ellison takes the score to a hundred and seventy-eight for seven takes Ellison to fourteen 

The other end Richard Davis is four

A full-pitched ball from Pringle and Ellison digs it out of his brock-ho block-hole

Just backing away

and it goes out to mid-off

They just get a single 

Takes Ellison up to fifteen and the score to a hundred and seventy-nine for seven

And the field changes over for the right-handed Richard Davis

A hundred and seventy-nine for seven Kent after being put in

Mark Benson made forty-three

Simon Hinks twenty-five

and Matthew Fleming fifty-one in just about as many balls with six fours to revitalize the lower half of the innings

In comes Pringle

Bowls a bouncer to Davis who swats it down through square-leg

They 've taken one

They 're coming back for the second

He 's t haring in

The ba throw is just wide of the stumps from Suli Mallik

And so they come back safely for the second run

Takes Davis on to six and the score past a hundred and eighty

A hundred and eighty-one for seven 

And  Pringle prepares to bowl the last ball of this Kent innings

He 'll bowl it to the tall figure of Richard Davis who pats his bat in the crease advances down the pitch and then just glides it down backward to square on the off side

They 've taken one

They 're coming back for the second

If the throw is accurate he 'll struggle

But it wasn't all that accurate so Davis gets a well-taken two to finish off the innings at a hundred and eighty-three for seven

Kent put in

That 's a challenging enough total but not uh impossible for a powerful Essex batting line-up uh and should provide us with a very interesting second half to this Sunday afternoon in the sunshine down here at Folkestone

A hundred and eighty-three for seven is the final score for Kent after being put in to bat with uh  Ellison finishing at fifteen not out and uh Davis at the other end

Eight at the end

Just to run through the uh batsmen who scored the runs Taylor four Benson forty-three Hinks twenty-five in only twenty f one twenty-one balls Graham Cowdry fifteen Nigel Long five Matthew Fleming that delightful fifty-one Steve Marsh six

So that is the final Kent score a hundred and eighty-three for seven

So Tom Moody then has completed the running repairs to his bat

He 's going to face the leg-spin of Andy Roberts who 's only a twenty-year-old

He 's playing his first Sunday League game 

He 's only five foot five

He 's a tiny little chap

He 's going to bowl to Moody who has ninety-nine 

Worcestershire one hundred and seventy-two for one 

and Moody has so far faced  eighty-two balls 

He looks around the field 

And in comes Roberts now to bowl to him from the Football End

Moody on ninety-nine

In he comes

It 's pitched up and Moody plays that away to mid-wicket

There 's no run

Allan Lamb does the fielding and returns the ball  to Roberts 

Roberts then turns again at the Football End

Comes in to Moody on ninety-nine

He 's in now past umpire Harris

It 's pitched up

Moody drives straight

That 's going to be his hundred 

The ball rolls out to David Capel at long-on 

Eighty-four balls for Tom Moody 's third hundred in the Refuge League this year 

Eighty-eight minutes eighty-four balls two sixes and twelve fours

A quite phenomenal innings

Worcester a hundred and seventy-three for one

Tom Moody one hundred not out

So Alan Walker then uh shapes up to bowl the last over of Worcester 's innings

Two hundred and forty-six for four

He bowls to Neal

A slower ball outside the off stump

Neal has a huge carve at that

but deceived totally by the change of pace

and misses it

The ball goes through to David Ripley  for no run

Two forty-six for four

Graham Hick has forty-seven not out

Phil Neal the Worcester captain has fifteen not out

The innings of course uh revolved entirely around an innings of one hundred by Tom Moody

Here comes Walker then in to Neal

It 's pitched up on the off side and Neal carves that away to Felton who 's hovering on the cover  edge of the ring really

He hasn't uh He 's not saving one there by any means so he allows a single and indeed Neal trots the easy one

Two forty-seven for four which brings Graham Hick down to face Walker

He 's on forty-seven

Walker is in now past umpire John Harris

It 's pitched up and Hick goes for it

A huge hit on the leg side

It 's up in the air

There 's three fielders going for it 

He 's out

Allan Lamb holds him at deep mid-wicket 

A very good catch indeed

The ball went way out of our vision here in the commentary box

There 's a low roof

But three men were converging Andy Roberts from long-on Tony Pemberthy from deep mid-wicket and Allan Lamb from orthodox mid-wicket

It was Lamb that got there in the end

He ran back probably twenty or thirty yards and took the catch as the ball looped over his head

So the end of a fine innings from Graham Hick

He departs for Ian Consal forty-seven 

And surprisingly he only hit three fours in that

So uh  perhaps not the uh the mighty Graham Hick that we know

but uh it was scored at a very reasonable rate which no doubt Ian will tell me  in a moment

So that is two hundred and forty-seven for five 

Fifty-three balls

I 'm reliably informed that uh forty-seven came in

So although containing only three boundaries uh a very reasonable rate indeed 

The new batsman is Martin Weston a solidly built all-rounder who uh is really a Sunday specialist 

He 's coming out now

And there are only four balls left  three balls left of this Worcestershire innings

Two hundred and forty-seven for five

They lost Curtis for forty-nine Moody for a hundred Ian Botham for ten Dolevera for three and just now Graham Hick for forty-seven 

Alan Walker then comes in right arm medium pace to bowl to Phil Neal

And Neal charges and inside edges that onto his pad

W They 're going for a quick single

Weston just makes it as Walker tries to kick the ball into the stumps

He missed in the end in fact and David Ripley  backing up was able to do the fielding

Two hundred and forty-eight for five

Neal moves on to sixteen

Seventeen correction

The scoreboard is just uh moving now

And Martin Weston comes down

Two balls remaining  in this Worcestershire innings 

Alan Walker turns at the Football End running in off the full fifteen yards that 's permissible

He comes in now past umpire John Harris and bowls

And Weston digs that full-length ball out

He hits it out to long-off

They think about the second but no

David Capel comes in and a good throw through to David Ripley makes sure they only in fact take the single 

One ball remaining 

Indeed it is

Phil Neal will face it

Two hundred and forty-nine for five certainly a  a pretty impressive total there set up by Tom Moody 's one hundred off just eighty-five balls

And Walker comes in now for this final ball

It 's outside the leg stump and Neal gives himself room and carves that straight down the field 

Walker gets a hand on it but the ball in fact runs out to long-on where Andy Roberts who is by the way the smallest first-class cricketer we checked it up earlier on does the fielding and that 's the end of Worcestershire 's innings

Two hundred and fifty  for five

Two hundred and fifty-one for five correction

The scoreboard just moving there

Phil Neal finishing on nineteen not out

and Martin Weston on one

The men out Curtis for forty-nine

Tom Moody for one hundred two sixes twelve fours

and he faced just eighty-five balls

Graham Hick made forty-seven Ian Botham ten Dolevera run out for three

The bowling figures

Taylor seven overs no maidens none for forty-eight

Walker six overs no maidens one for thirty-four

Pemberthy seven overs no maidens none for thirty-nine

David Capel five overs for forty-six very expensive two sixes and four fours off his bowling

Craig Thomas eight overs one for thirty-six a good spell from him

and Andy Roberts the young leg-spinner playing in his first Sunday League game seven overs no maidens one for thirty-six and a creditable wicket that of Tom Moody

So Northamptonshire then require two hundred and fifty-two to win

That 's after the interval

And that was a starting rate of just over four and a half an over

and Essex are making a pretty good fist of it despite having lost Graham Gooch in the first over to the shock of all those who 'd come d down through the Dartford Tunnel from Essex no doubt

He was out for nought bowled by Egleston in the off the sixth ball of the first over

Stevenson has also gone

He 's was bowled by Ellison

He jumped out to drive him and was bowled for four

That was twenty-two for two in the sixth over

And the reason for the slight recovery in uh Essex 's fortunes was Suli Mallik who 's been batting delightfully

He 's thirty-two not out already

and uh he has with him uh Paul Pritchard who is ten not out

Both of them have played some very pleasant shots in Essex 's forty-nine for two at the moment

And we 're in the twelfth over of this innings which is being bowled by Ellison

I think in actual fact Jaguar could probably turn the boost down if they had one

They 've now completed forty-nine laps

the lead car with Tio Fabi the little Italian at the wheel

and uh they 're more than two minutes ahead of the rest of the field

So forty-nine of the eighty-three laps completed

Tio Fabi in the lead car

and Joe Bloggs is just pacing around in the pits waiting for Fabi to bring that car in

He 'll take it over the lead car and hopefully pilot it to uh a sensational victory at Silverstone

Jaguar of course defending their title here in this World Sports-Car Championship race

In eleventh place is Martin Brundle

Now that doesn't sound much but he 's actually gone extremely well

He 's eaten into that seven laps that he lost originally uhm when he was delayed in the pits with a throttle cable failure

And he 's hopeful of getting into the points by the end of eighty-three laps

So it 's Tio Fabi in the Jaguar leading from the Mercedes of Wendlinger in second place

and then another gap of over a minute to Keki Rosberg 's Peugeot with forty-nine of eighty-three laps completed

Well I 've just spotted that on the Stretford End there aren't that many people on the Stretford End tonight but there 's a red flag there adorned by the Hammer and Sickle

And I doubt if that 's ever been seen before at that particular end of Old Trafford at any end of Old Trafford

As the Soviet Union attack it 's Kolianov inside the penalty area

The goalkeeper committed himself

Goycachea moved out of his penalty area

Kolianov couldn't get the ball across the area where other red shirts were waiting for it and the danger is averted as far as Argentinia are concerned























It 's actually a pretty outstanding game so far

All we 've lacked is the finish

There 's been tremendous pace out there

Lovely football

One-twos

It 's uh I I was tempted to say it 's much the best football we 've seen at Old Trafford this season but that 's unfair to uh Alex Ferguson 's  team

But you think of that pitch that 's hampered United so much this season

It does not hamper It hasn't hampered so far these two international sides who have really looked as if they 've something important to play for

And what they have of course is their future to play for

Changes since the world cup dramatic changes indeed since these sides met in Italy while only two two players one on either side survive from their group match in the World Cup

Goycachea in goal for Argentina

and Drob Dobrolovski who 's one of the Soviet changes tonight

He didn't play against England on Tuesday evening

It 's a throw-in to the Soviet Union near side of the field inside their half

It is the long-haired Shalimov now

He evades the challenge and moves forward already midway inside Argentina 's half

Kolianov makes the break a little bit too early and the pass was hit behind him

Argentina have possession

And it 's with Simioni inside the centre circle

The lay off to Moreno

Simioni makes the break down the far side

The Argentina left

The ball is played towards him with a little bit too much pace and it beats him and runs behind for a goal kick 





















Twenty-five minutes gone

Argentina nil the Soviet Union nil

Shalimov plays the ball forward

It catches the hand let 's say of Franco

He certainly put his hand up played the ball

It 'll be a free kick to the Soviet Union eight yards inside the Argentina half

Played carefully by Kulkov to Dobrovolski

Rebounds to Kulkov again

Forward to Kolianov just outside the penalty area

Turns away from one challenge

Can't beat the second

And Argentina bring it clear

They 'll break in the near side with Garcia just on the halfway line

Three red shirts converge on him and the red shirts win out

It 's back with Saba who 's an interesting character a actually

He 's played for Dinamo Tbilisi

He was in the International Squad

but once the political troubles started in Georgia he was persuaded by Balshevitz the Soviet manager that it would be in his best interests to move club

and he 's since gone to Dinamo Kiev

A slightly controversial transfer that was

He 's down and injured at the moment

He 's been caught in a challenge and the Soviet physio comes on to give him some attention 

























Oh this is disappointing because Saba is being taken off

The injury didn't look that serious at first

but clearly it is

and he will take no further part in the game or certainly won't take any  further part at the moment

And indeed the substitute is just stripping off

And uh it will be Kuznecov

The experienced Kuznecov will come on in his place

The referee Mr Nicolsen from Denmark waves the substitute on

Kuzniecko Kuznecov instead of Saba

That 's a shame

But play 's under way once more

Soviet Union have made their change

There 's still no score with twenty-seven and a half minutes of the first international at Old Trafford for twenty-five years

And if you doubt the commitment of the two teams here well just witness that challenge uh made by Argentina 's who was it  Vasquez

Well that was

He pulled the player back and then Michalichenko 's having a disagreement as well with Astrada

I tell you

it 's not exactly exhibition stuff out there in terms of temperament

















He was tempted and he shows a yellow card now

And it 's to Garcia for a late challenge on Shalimov 











It 's a free kick to the Soviet Union

Mostovoi takes it  midway inside Argentina 's half

Played forward by Kulkov

Kolianov comes sure to take it

Back to Mostovoi

Chips it forward

Kulkov with a header down to Kolianov

Kulkov once more

Wide to Shalimov

Kulkov  heavily involved for the Soviet Union  plays it wide to Shalimov

Calls for the early cross

Goes into the penalty area

Franco is there to make the interception for Argentina

And they bring it clear in the near side and then lose possession once more

Only momentarily because this time it 's Kulkov who offends in a challenge

and it will be a free kick to Argentina

Twenty-nine minutes played

Argentina nil the Soviet Union nil

And remembering that England of course beat the Soviet Union by three goals to one at Wembley on Tuesday evening

Argentina to come at Wembley on Saturday

A game that as well you 'll be able to hear live on Five during Sport on Five on Saturday afternoon

Argentina play the ball down the right flank

Garcia the blond-haired figure goes chasing after it

Kuznecov the substitute gets there first and Garcia was being over-aggressive and he mouthed his discontent to the referee for the decision

He has to be careful

He 's already been booked

Play under way

Michalichenko plays it forward to the halfway line

Kolianov turns away well from Vasquez

Turns back

Referee allows play to go on

He was tempted to award the free kick

Soviet Union still in possession

It 's with Dobrolovski near side Soviet left

Cuts infield

Plays a lovely low ball forward

Kolianov inside the penalty area onside as well

Turns one way then left

Michalichenko with a great chance

His shot is blocked

He 's had another chance

He 's bundled over was he

No

Referee waves away appeals for a penalty kick and Argentina break on the far side of the field

It 's with Moreno

Back to Visconti

Visconti 's pass forward not such a good one

And the Soviet Union have possession once more

And was that a penalty















He looks a good player too

Garcia playing the one-two edge of the Soviet penalty area

Doesn't quite come off and uh the Soviets have possession once more 

Threaded forward

and

oh dear

what was Dobrolovski thinking of

Forgot to kick the ball the way he intended the pass to go

Argentina have possession on the far side but it 's allowed to run out of play

And it will be a throw-in to the Soviet Union











Well  Argenditina Argentina didn't make it count too often in the World Cup in terms of goals

And play is stopped once more because there 's again a dispute

Somebody 's been hit off the ball and the Argentinians are appealing furiously to the referee

I think Dobrolovski may have been slightly involved in that incident

The Argentinian is down on the ground

He 's receiving attention now from  two doctors who 've rushed on

And what is the referee 's decision

It 's Simioni who 's gone down









It 's extraordinary isn't it

It 's supposed to

Oh all right uh we 've got a triangular tournament the England Challenge Cup but there 's nothing friendly about it out there nothing friendly at all

It 's highly competitive and despite the schoolboyish chants you hear in the background I 'm telling you on a normal Saturday afternoon in midwinter Old Trafford would be roaring its approval or disapproval of what 's going on out there

It 's certainly very interesting 

I think Dobrolovski may have got away with it  perhaps because the referee didn't see the incident

And now that 's fair enough











Basualdo will take the free kick for Argentina

It 's a bit hot out there

Taken short

Garcia flicks it forward to the edge of the penalty area

A start cleared by Kanchelskis who 's sort of pretty quiet

Old Trafford debut so far this evening

But it has not been a very quiet game

This time the flag is up for offside

It 's offside against Visconti on the far side

That 's the Soviet right

And the Soviets take the free kick quickly 

It 's with the tall number two Chernishkov

Plays centre of defence

Pity to play the one-two with Kulkov

Plays it

Still just midway inside his own half

Plays it uh ss slightly carelessly forward left-footed towards Galiamin

Back to Kulkov now inside the Soviet half

Forward to Kanchelskis

Pass wasn't a particularly good one

Kulkov has the ball once more

Argentina just  wide back about ten yards away from him inviting him to make a decision as to what he 's going to do

Comes along square across the defence to Kuznecov

Back to Cernishko

Short of the centre circle

Players making breaks ahead of him  forty yards ahead of him

Kulkov slides the ball forward inside the centre circle

Kuznecov 's made the break and then flips it wide to the near side

Lovely pass to Shalimov now

Just a few yards outside the Argentina penalty area

Turns infield

Lays the ball to his right

Chance for Kuznecov twenty-five yards out

Didn't quite have the control

Breaks to Kolianov

Edge of the penalty area

Oh and was that a penalty

Well there was certainly an infringement

No

The referee allows play to go on

I thought that Mostovoi was brought down inside the penalty area

Still the pressure on Argentina

Kuznecov  five yards outside the penalty area plays it wide again to Kanchelskis

Kanchelskis is tackled and the ball is out of play

And it will be a throw-in for the Soviet Union



That 's twice within five minutes the Soviet Union might 've had a penalty 

They 've got a throw-in  which they 'll have to settle for on the far side

Galiamin  will take it

We 've got some ten minutes to go to half time

And it 's still the Soviet Union nil Argentina nil

but no shortage of interesting attractive play here at Old Trafford

Here 's one of the main providers  Kolianov running toward the penalty area

He 's tackled but play 's allowed to go on

Oh that 's surely a penalty

Mostovoi is pushed over

No question on that occasion 

I think it was little Garcia who was at fault

Rugieri comes across to argue anyway

The referee had no doubts whatsoever

And if Mostovoi wasn't pushed a moment ago he was certainly pushed then

And with nine minutes to go to half time the Soviet Union have a penalty kick 

Before the kick will be taken attention is going to be paid  to Kolianov who was brought down quite ruthlessly just a few yards outside the penalty area but still managed to get the pass through Jimmy to Mostovoi to make the penalty

Tottenham have it far side with Maine

The challenge was late by Rocastle

And uh the referee decided not to speak to the player and gives Tottenham a free kick a yard in from uh that left flank

Taken quickly by Van Den Howe

then Lineker 's involved

so is Stuart

but Tottenham can't get it forward

Stuart pushed back into his own half and then able to s to deliver it out to this right to Fenwick

First time ball forward

Lineker had come deep to collect then pushes it back to Stuart inside his own half

Tries to play it short to Samways

Samways  well strokes it back to Mabbutt

Mabbutt out to Fenwick on his right

and Tottenham have started with confidence

Bit short that to Fenwick

and Fenwick trying to turn it in the path of Mabbutt

Getting himself into all sorts of problems

And Campbell sprinting through that uh central position nearly pouncing on the mistake

Tottenham have it though back in their own possession

Nieme though

Forward ball never ever reached uh  Lineker

Adams intercepts plays it up-field

but straight back by Fenwick

Chested down by Lineker

Turns it out to this right flank

Now Paul Allen can run at those Arsenal defenders

Stuart has joined the attack

Samways is short

Played just a matter of yards for Vinnie Samways

Samways still in possession then able to drop it off for Fenwick

Neat little chip into space into the penalty box

Stuart

Can he get the cross in

And the tackle was well timed by David Hillier

Stuart trying to turn that into a crowded penalty box 

Does win a corner off the boot of the number four for Arsenal David Hillier and it will be a corner that uh Vinnie Samways will take on this Tottenham right

Four Spurs players on the edge of that penalty box

And in the six yard box Stuart is there

so is Lineker

and so is David Howes

That 's whipped across there

The header well well cleared there by David O'Leary under some uh considerable pressure

O'Leary getting it clear

And a break is on now for Arsenal and for Rocastle

And a challenge with uh Paul Allen

Allen did well to uh  recover  

Rocastle looked to have a yard of pace on him

Allen got that well saved the danger and those white shirts of Tottenham have possession with Steve Sedgely and he will just plant it back into the penalty box for Eric Torsvord to calm things down

But uh a game

For the first twelve minutes it 's been entertaining

Certainly harder to uh better that semi-final performance one of the magical performances by uh Tottenham here at Wembley

But this is the Charity Shield a week away from the season

Spurs open at Southampton

Arsenal at home to Queen 's Park Rangers

and they 're building up towards that season

Thirteen and a half minutes gone

It 's live on L B C

It 's Arsenal nil Tottenham Hotspur nil

Arsenal unable to beat Spurs on three occasions last season

And the Gunners in possession

Rocastle trying to push forward

Dixon 's gone on a run out to the right and he 's got away from Nieme

He 's got behind the defence

He keeps it in by that by-line

but then the tackle comes in from Nieme

And it 'll be a throw from Arsenal just a few yards from that corner flag

Dixon got forward well

An attacking fullback wanting to show Graham Taylor that although he missed that tour of the Far East he should be starting in the England line-up for the next uh international the friendly against West Germany

So Dixon with a throw a chance to uh play that long into the penalty box

Smith was up there

Howes won it in the air

and then just hooked away by Stuart

Falls nicely for Rocastle who 'll try and keep the momentum the impetus there

Tries to link up with uh Allan Smith

Smith keeps it in

Not a lot of room on that far side

and eventually dispossessed

and Nieme can come away with it link up with uh Lineker

Neat little ball by Lineker

Frees Samways

Now it 's out with Fenwick on this right side the near side for Tottenham

And then a clatter a challenge there between uh Winterburn and Paul Allen

Both of them went in there

a crunching challenge

Out of play

a Spurs throw close to halfway

Fourteen and a half minutes

We 're back very shortly here at Wembley

Well eighteen minutes on the clock in this nineteen ninety-one F A Charity Shield

The score Arsenal nil Tottenham Hotspur nil

But Arsenal a few moments ago had a good chance perhaps to uh go one up in this game

A ball played into the box low by Paul Davis

and there was Kevin Campbell getting free of his marker

Got his shot in rather hurriedly

and the ball flying over the bar

and uh the chance was wasted for Arsenal

Earlier Campbell also had a chance when uh a long throw-in by Dixon was flicked on at the near post

It fell to Campbell

He didn't quite get his shot in and Torsvord was able to gather the ball

We 're uh just taking a break in proceedings at the moment as a Tottenham player receives some uh treatment on the deck



Could 've easily been one nil to the Gunners

Well happily for the Tottenham supporters Vinnie Samways is fit and well

And David O'Leary will float the free kick forward towards big Allan Smith

Gets his head up but it 's cleared by David Howes

That 'll be a throw-in to Arsenal about fifteen yards inside from the corner flag on this near side and it 'll be taken by Nigel Winterburn quickly

Finds Smith

Smith not quite able to control it

Dispossessed by Mabbutt

Battling performance from the Spurs skipper

but Arsenal have repossessed

Here 's Davis to Hillier in the centre of midfield

Finds Lee Dixon

Dixon tries to get a ball through

Bit of a chance perhaps for Nieme to break away

He plays it for Lineker

The flag stays down

No it doesn't

Well in fact the flag stayed down because the linesman dropped his flag in trying to raise it

so it stayed down in one sense

but in the end uh he raised the flag

and uh Gary Lineker to his dismay fi found that uh he was on the end of a an offside decision there

But uh a moment of uh light comedy there from the linesman as the flag flew out of his hand

and uh Lineker thought he was onside

But uh happily on the far side he gathered up his flag and hoisted it into the air and Arsenal are back in possession with skipper Tony Adams on halfway

Finds Paul Merson

Merson back once again to his captain

and uh clatters onto the ground there with Paul Stuart

That 'll be a free kick to Arsenal

It looked perhaps to me as if uh Stuart had a little bit of a go off the ball there which is not something we particularly want to see this afternoon

And the referee Terry Holdbrook is uh having a word with Paul Stuart the uh Tottenham player who of course was such an inspiration in that F A Cup Final victory over Nottingham Forest here in May

Equalising

and also a tremendous all round performance after Gascoigne had gone off injured

Free kick then to Arsenal

It 's uh midway inside the Tottenham half

Hillier takes it

Smith tries to lay a ball off to Campbell

It doesn't come off though and Fenwick gets it away

Finds Lineker

Lineker touches it back first time

It 's not a good ball though and Van Den Howe will have to backtrack but he keeps the ball in play for Tottenham

Pat Van Den Howe the former Everton fullback who uh knows all about F A Cup glory and Wembley glory

He finds uh Paul Allen

Allen under a challenge from Winterburn

Keeps possession

Still Paul Allen

Nice little touch there for Van Den Howe

Van Den Howe in turn finds Sedgely 

And it 's now on the far side with Howes who clips it forward to Lineker

Can't control it though

It 's swept up by Rocastle

And Dixon has it and the ball goes uh all the way back to the uh Arsenal penalty area and David Seaman just fields it and then knocks it out to Tony Adams on the edge of the eighteen-yard box

Adams uh has found Davis coming towards him

Davis lays it back off to Nigel Winterburn

Winterburn 's got Hillier looking for a pass

Instead he spreads it wide cross-field to David O'Leary the veteran Republic of Ireland defender just inside the Arsenal half

Long ball forward looking for Campbell

Campbell gets his head up well and finds Paul Merson on the edge of the box

A chance perhaps here for Arsenal

Still Merson

Two Spurs defenders around him

But that 's a poor ball and David Howes is there to pick up the pieces

And Tottenham perhaps themselves now try and come forward

Howes plays it

It 's a good ball

but uh it was misjudged by Stuart

and uh Arsenal have it with David Rocastle his uh left arm heavily bandaged after that hand injury he suffered in the  tournament when Arsenal lost on penalties to Sampdoria

Here 's uh Paul Merson wide left just in or halfway inside the Tottenham half

Good ball by uh Merson

Smith heads it in but it 's offside

The flag was up very early

It was a lovely ball into the box by Merson but it was uh fairly clear that Smith was in an offside position



The offside trap working on that occasion 

Well certainly Kevin Campbell uh got the better of uh of Mabbutt on that occasion and that allowed Merson the chance to swing that cross in

It was a good header by Smith but uh on that occasion Arsenal were given a dose of their own medicine as the uh Tottenham defenders moved forward in uh sequence and he was caught offside

They have a free kick

Now it 's played forward by Nieme

Lineker acrobatically with uh the right foot shot but uh Seaman is well able to gather it

Lineker got it on the volley

Twisted in the air and stuck his right boot out

Never really got uh over the shot and uh the ball went high into the air and Seaman was uh quite happy to claim that one with uh some comfort

Here 's Tony Adams the Arsenal captain looking to build up once again

Plays it to his fellow central defender David O'Leary

O'Leary goes right along the back four and finds Dixon just inside the Arsenal half

Another long ball forward looking for Kevin Campbell

I think that 's asking a little bit much of him

and Pat Van Den Howe is happy to uh side-foot that one into touch

and Arsenal will have a throw-in on the far side

It 's only about five yards in from the corner flag and Lee Dixon goes across

We 've seen a couple of occasions already in this game where uh long throws by Dixon from that far side caused a little bit of anxiety around the near post as Allan Smith or Campbell both looked to try and get a vital touch on

But this time Dixon 's taken a short throw to Rocastle but he has it once again the England fullback

Swings it in right-footed

Smith goes up

Good header there by Sedgely though

But Arsenal have a corner as the roar goes up to my uh right-hand side

The uh Tottenham fans occupying the tunnel end of Wembley this afternoon

and their Arsenal rivals at the opposite end of the stadium

And uh Paul Davis will uh line up the corner kick for Arsenal

O'Leary 's gone up for this one

Adams hovering on the edge of the box

Here it is

Good header away though by Van Den Howe as it falls to Dixon

Dixon back to Davis wide on the right

Good cross by him

Adams has gone up but Torsvord 's held on to it

That was a well timed run by the Arsenal captain

The ball floated in and Adams made a splendid run from the edge of the box to put pressure on the Norwegian goalkeeper

He didn't quite gather it cleanly first time but uh thankfully for Spurs he got hold of it in the end and Adams was uh denied the chance

Really the chances there have been in this opening twenty-five minutes

it is now certainly going Arsenal 's way

They 've had a goal disallowed

and they 've seen Campbell go close on a couple of occasions

and a half chance there for Adams as well

At the other end really not too much

A An acrobatic effort by Lineker but uh  the Arsenal back four seem to be standing firm

We 've seen some good tackling by them

As Spurs give the ball away once again it 's Allan Smith finding Nigel Winterburn out wide

Winterburn will play it down the line

That 's a great ball for Merson

Got some space in front of him as he reaches the by-line

Cuts inside

Little chip cross towards Campbell

Great header by Mabbutt though

Falls for Stuart

Stuart uh chips it out towards Paul Allen

Allen gets his header in

Finds Lineker

Good tackle though by Adams

and Vinnie Samways is able to calm it down put his foot on the ball steady it for Tottenham and find uh Terry Fenwick who must be enjoying this day tremendously

And so in the town of Saint Godin the field rolls away facing today a hundred and seventy-two kilometres

and in the yellow jersey for the very first time in his career  is Miguel Indurain of Spain 

A pleasant day indeed

and threatening to be the hottest of the Tour so far

It 's a ride of one hundred and seventy-two and a half kilometres taking the riders through the Haute Garonne  and into the department of the placename

It 's a most beautiful part of France now as the riders go over only one small climb today on the road to Castra 

And that small climb today was the C&ocircumflex;te des Saints 

It came after seventy-six kilometres

Hardly a hill at all 

but it developed into a nice battle between the two men at the top of the king of the mountain

Claudio Chiapucci outsprinting Andy Hampston with Hampston 's teammate Dag Otto Loretson  in third place

And Loretson used that sprint  to springboard to an attack and by the time the riders reached the hundred and fifteen kilometres covered point  there were twenty-two of them in the lead and the breakaway was very much under way 

And this is the breakaway and they now lead by three minutes and ten seconds

Twenty-two riders

And one rider in this breakaway which I 'm very very surprised to see here  is Jean Fran&ccedille;ois Bernard

He started the day today in ninth place  eight minutes and thirty-nine seconds behind and now with a lead of three minutes ten



And this might well be the plan for Indurain today to put away his teammate Jean Fran&ccedille;ois Bernard

But it just shows you this Tour de France really hasn't got a solid leader in my opinion 

Everybody every day is trying to attack the maillot jaune of the Tour de France and that is what is making this such a great race 

There 's an abundance of Motorola riders in this breakaway today including Dag Otto Loretson and Ulf Zimmerman  and also the sprinter Abdoujaparov 

He 's now back in his element after coming through the mountains and just about getting through the mountains

But he was in the sprint today

He picked up the first sprint of the day 

so he 's now back into building his lead once more in that green jersey competition as the best sprinter 

They 've given them quite a lead three minutes ten seconds

We 're looking down at the main field here

A predominance of pink top jerseys which means that the Lotto riders have missed out on the split  and they now want to try and get their sprinter Johann Museeuw back into contention 

It is a marvellous finish for the sprinters today long long long straight roads  down beautiful avenues of trees as they come through the Midi 



So Jean Fran&ccedille;ois Bernard on the Benesto team seemingly back to his old form of a couple of years ago  since he moved across to the Spanish team this year 

And now got himself into the breakaway along with Luc Leblanc 

But Charlie Motte lying second overall actually said this Tour de France wasn't over yet after yesterday 

and it looks as though he might be right 

Here 's where we are Saint Felix

and we 're on our way down to Castra

Just look at the beautiful scenery here

We 've met today a lot of English holiday-makers enjoying the hot sun down in the Midi 

And Indurain and Greg Lemond back in at the main peleton

And Greg Lemond I would think having to now reconstruct himself after that terrible bashing he took yesterday in the mountains

and have to think carefully now about how if indeed he can come back into this race in a big way as we go on towards the Alps 



This breakaway really has uh surprised the field

To allow so many riders away twenty-two of them in the lead

I 'm rather surprised the big field have let so many go

And the rider to the right there is Steven Hodge of Australia

Just taking some food out of his pocket

He 's made the split as well today  and didn't enjoy his trip through the Pyrenees but they recover so quickly these riders

Hodge now in with a chance of victory today 

Jean Claude Colotti the sprinter if it came down to the sprint would give a lot of these riders a good run for their money

He was second in Paris Dubay 

As the race now moves on nicely  leaving Saint Felix  

And there is the big field rolling into town 

And it looks as though the Lotto boys are are the ones that have missed out in this move

They haven't got a man up here 

A lot of the Italians have

We 've got Dim Dimitri Conichev just moving forward in our picture there

Ahead now

Hodge leads uh

Conichev goes over the top of him

and the big lanky figure there is Edwig Van Hoedonk  the winner of the Tour de Flanders this year

And the Buckler team have had a quiet Tour so far

They 've won only one stage

that was the victory by Yella Niedam on the road into La Valend uh Valencienne 

But this grou this group working extremely quickly now

It 's uhm Jean three-or-four-words too

It 's going to be a very hard chase indeed now for the main field to put matters right as we head down towards the finish in Castra





This is the man now who 's blazing the trail

Well he 's just gone off our picture but that was uh Kingsley Alta of Italy

Two minutes forty seconds now

Basically the same leading group

uh

but this rider has gone out on his own 

and we are now for him at least about eight kilometres from the line down in Castra 

He 's being chased at the last check by Marico Giavinetti of Italy the Tour of uh Spain winner l l last year and Jean Claude Colotti the sprinter



Approximately a minute 's advantage for the Italian over the rest of the original breakaway of twenty-two riders

The main field are chasing very hard  uh but there still remain over two minutes which means that uh Jean Francois Bernard and Luc Le Blanc are pu pulling back a minute of their deficit and could be going up the overall classification tonight

But this is the man

He broke away approximately twenty-five kilometres from the finish 

He sensed that the breakaway was not pulling its weight and he jumped away on his own 

Everybody hesitated

In fact Abdu Japerov chased him for a little while

but he was picked up

and now Kingsley Alta has built a minute over the main chase group  and approximately forty seconds over these two riders here

Jean Paul Colotti on the right 

and he was second this year in the Paris Dubay stage race uh Paris Dubay Classic rather breaking away to chase Marc name all the way home to the finish in Dubay 



He 's a very brave rider

He 's not one of those riders who thinks I 'm a sprinter

I can win a race if the field stay together

He 'll always have a go  and try and get to the finish cos it 's always easier  if you 're a sprinter

and it 's always safer to try and do that

That level crossing they went through there gives us six kilometres to go for these two riders 

and you can almost see there the fairing at the top of Colotti 's bicycle just underneath the seat tube there

You can see that 's a

I think there 's an attachment to the frame to try and cut down on the wind resistance 

Here we are with Bruno Cenghialta at the front here 

He 's got five kilometres to go now

so he 's almost six or seven hundred metres in front of those two chasing riders

This race in fact coming down to the finish  uh some eight to ten minutes ahead of the expected time today



Nice shot of Colotti 's new-style bicycle frame there  four kilometres to go now for the leader  Cenghialta and five kilometres to go

This is a chance to look back now at the group that Kingsley Alta has led



So there 's only in fact a kilometre between them and this group is closing in fast 

And the Carrera boys are now starting to fire  which means they must have swept up Abdoujaparov and the group  although I I must confess we we don't know if they have done that but they wouldn't be chasing like this if Abdoujaparov was still up the road because they would want their sprinter to stay out in front  

And there 's the four kilometres to go now for the two chasers and the peleton have clearly wiped out the rest of the twenty-two breakaways

We had no news of that happening at all 

And here 's the information

and confirmed 

One minute five to the Groupe Le Blanc

so that 's the group that contains Abdu Japerov

Forty-one seconds to Colotti and Giavanetti who was in our picture just then 

and two twenty to the peleton

so the gap is still there 

Uh

back to the main field which mystifies me a little bit as to why Carrera are chasing so hard

Well Ciapucci fourth overall in the Tour de France

He said yesterday after he won the stage so brilliantly in the Pyrenees that he felt he 'd lost too much time in the time trial to uh Alain name the other week

and he felt that he would probably win the Tour de France

His favourite was now name to win 

Bruno Cenghialta here always checking over his shoulder with two kilometres to go to see if he can see those riders closing in on him

but  he 's going extremely well

He doesn't seem to be weakening at all

He 's got to stay clear just through these streets

I think he may well be the man who 's going to take the stage today although those two riders behind  are putting in a very good chase 

Here he gets out of the saddle on the small drive through the town accelerating  pushing himself to the limit all the time

He knows he 's just got to hang on for another kilometre

Another couple of minutes and the stage victory in the Tour de France could be his 

He is 

He finished a hundred and second in the Tour de France last year 

And so an Italian victory on the cards inside the last kilometre

but they 're all hunting him down

These two are chasing very very fast onto him

I don't think they 're going to catch him because they 're getting so close to the finish now

Colotti getting a little bit restless 

uh

but they might hold off the main chase group to the line

and the peleton closing in all of the time as well 

This beautiful uh town in the middle of the placename

and the whole town shut down for the arrival on a Saturday afternoon

The referee from Cornwall blows his whistle

and we 're off and running with Arsenal kicking from left to right and trailing by a goal to nil on a mild clear night in the West Midlands

And the ball is chipped forward by Arsenal inside right position towards the edge of the Coventry box

In comes David Rocastle as the chip was headed down by Lee Hurst and it 's back in the hands of goalkeeper Steve Ogrizovitch

Hurst 's hair as as he comes across towards this near side

and we get a a clearer look at it

I thought actually when he came on he was very very blond

but in fact he 's more ginger-haired than blond-haired on this near side

That 's Steve Ogrizovitch who clears the way then right footing towards that Arsenal half

And Colin Pates a little bit lucky to get it

As Paul Furlong missed it in the air

Pates away towards the left-hand touch line

Behind them there 's Limpar though

Trickles out of play with Limpar closely watched by the right fullback once more Martin Beatty

Beatty will steady himself and take the throw-in

Five foot eight inches tall stocky lad about twelve and a half stone

Throws in towards the edge of the penalty on the right hand side

Here is Kevin Callagher laying it off now

Kevin Callagher square across the penalty area and Dave Seaman again goes down

Knocks down on it and David Seaman can throw away towards this near touchline and Arsenal can bring it away through Lee Dixon

Dixon now down the right-hand touch line

Looks for Paul Merson

Merson holds it up well under close attendance again by the left fullback Lee Hurst

Plays it back up the line ten yards away

ten yards inside the Coventry half is Lee Dixon

Dixon threads it through two pairs of legs towards Ian Wright

and Wright 's first touch who had too much weight on it

and he knocks it out of play with this near touch line in front of a crowd around about fifteen thousand here at Ifield Road

Everton three Wolves one

Tony Cotty gets his ninth goal of the season

Coventry City one Arsenal nil

Everton three Wolves one

Manchester United nil Portsmouth nil

Norwich nil Brentford nil

Forest two Bristol Rovers nil

Sheffield Wednesday the holders one Southampton nil

In the Second Division Leicester lead at Brighton one nil

Charlton tied at one apiece at home to Ipswich

And it 's Southend one Oxford United three

Quite a bit of a surprise at Roots Hall

Down the line then

Free kick ta by Coventry City 's Peter Billings

Boots it away and it trickles out over the head of Collin Pates and also Paul Furlong and away for an Arsenal goal kick

Furlong 

and he just drops it

and David Seaman has to run out and collect and put it back inside the six yard area and will clear it away

Round about oh I would say oh easy two thousand Arsenal fans up here tonight

Maybe two and a half

There 's about fifteen hundred on the in the sky-blue stand opposite me 

and trapped into this near side of the terracing the east end terracing to my right-hand side about another  another thousand

I suppose

It 's Arsenal now

On the defence now it 's becoming a habit just inside the Gunners ' half

They lead one goal to nil with Kevin Gallagher

Intelligent lay out towards Ray Woods hugging the right-hand touch line

Takes free kicks uh with great aplomb does Ray Woods

Should be giving curling them in

This time it was a flat ball and Kevin Gallagher Kevin Gallagher running at Dav Paul Davis who got the challenge in

and it 's a throw-in to Coventry

Ten yards from the dead ball line

Taken down the line looking for Kevin Gallagher

and Kevin Gallagher forces Nigel Winterburn to touch it away for a throw-in

is it

or is it a corner kick

No one seems to know

The linesman certainly didn't even flag

The referee looking across towards that far side as if he didn't know what to give a throw-in or a corner kick

He 's now gives a throw-in and will be taken by Booty

Booty throws short then to Furlong

Furlong back to goal

Winterburn behind him

and there 's Limpar

Takes it off his toes and was just shrugged off a little bit

so it 's a free kick to Arsenal

Limpar will leave it for Nigel Winterburn

Winterburn takes the free kick

Rolls it out  to Colin Pates

Oh

that was a wretched free kick putting them under all sorts of pressure

but in the end David Rocastle has to chip thirty yards back to David Seaman

and Seaman can throw out towards Lee Dixon on the right hand touch line

Dixon with Coventry City coming back at him

That was uh Kevin Gallagher chasing back with him

Dixon sweeps it across field again

The delivery is poor

They

No one on the end of it

It was just a bad ball across the field and Coventry regained possession with Pe Paul Furlong

Furlong out towards Woods

Woods chucks it inside to Stewart Robson in support

In comes a shining challenge

Booty coming in from the right hand touch line follows up there and wins it back for Coventry

Booty cuts it away turns it back up to Ray Woods

Ray Woods dinks it through inside right channel here towards Stewart Robson

Back it comes to Woods

Woods square then to uh Dave Smith

Smith is slotted into a central midfield position at the moment

To McGrath

McGrath slightly left on side

McGrath towards the edge of the box

Paul Furlong

Furlong wide towards the left fullback Lee Hurst

And Hurst bends his foot over the ball rolls his foot over the ball and now crosses too high and away for a goal kick

Let 's go to Carrow Road

Norwich City against Brentford

Ian Crocker















Norwich City uh Brentford of course without Perry Suckling who uh is ineligible to play

Crystal Palace wouldn't let him play

He 's on loan at the moment from the Eagles

And it 's Arsenal now on the attack with Allan Smith

Smith through the edge of the penalty area

and as one challenged knocked it past the covering Lee Hurst

but couldn't quite get 

Ogrizovitch can clear away

A few Arsenal fans away to my right thought that Smith had been fouled but I don't think he had been

Now and there 's Limpar

Limpar

Coventry appeal for offside

No says the referee

Limpar tries to put it forward to Allan Smith

shrun Shrugs his shoulders and turns away in despair

Martin Booty chips down the right-hand touch line

It 's headed inside by Nigel Winterburn into the path of Gallagher

Gallagher now switches outside Winterburn

He 's drawn Colin Pates away towards the left-hand side of the penalty area as we look at it

He 's pulled it back now to Ray Woods

In comes Woods

Cross

and it 's Dave Seaman who brings it down and throws it away to Paul Merson

Uhm Norwich City have gone two nil up

Robert Flack

Two goals inside a minute

Robert Flack 's sixth of the season

The details on that in a few moments ' time as soon as we get a break in the play

So Brentford 's cup run taking in Barnet eight six Brighton six five a whole hatful of goals  so far in the Rumbelow 's League Cup

That run is seemingl seemingly coming to an end at Harrow Road

Arsenal have surely got a free kick here

Anders Limpar

Well George Graham was angry with the referee in Benfica

He said that Anders Limpar was given no protection

And more than once Bobby Moore and myself from our eagle 's eyrie high above the pitch winced as the challenges came in on Anders Limpar and again he 's been given a buffeting over on that far left-hand touch-line

Free kick touch to

Just short by Nigel Winterburn

In comes the cross

Steve Ogrizovitch plucks it out of the air

and it 's going to take a lot to beat this ginormous six foot three inch fourteen and a half stone goalkeeper tonight

His handling has been more than comfortable after that initial glitch when he went to the edge of the penalty area and committed himself and collided with Lee Hurst and Arsenal couldn't take advantage

So Ogrizovitch through the middle for Coventry to lead by a goal to nil

And as it 's knocked on further forward by Billing it 's into the hands of Dave Seaman

Seaman then went from end to end with a couple of touches

Seaman right foot kicks from  's half volley

and Ian Wright beaten in the air by Andy Pearce

Well Andy Pearce has won simply won everything the twenty-five-year-old signed from  Town

And Coventry building down that their right

This is where most of their attacks have come from throughout the game aimed at Arsenal 's left 

And they have a throw-in

Couple of yards inside the Gunners ' half

And it 's a throw-in to be taken by Martin Booty the youngster

To Gallagher

Gallagher just flicks off to Ray Woods

and Woods can see that Seaman had strayed about three yard 

A rather cheeky chip and it uh just  ends up behind David Seaman 's goal uhm in the seats in the sky blue seats

A lot of them there

Coventry City fans perhaps should get behind their side a little bit more than they do because it 's twenty-five years in the First Division for the Sky Blues

and that 's you know that 's some effort for a side who don't really attract great gates

A hundred and fifteen odd thousand here tonight

And Coventry have possession wide on the right hand side

Kevin Gallagher

Gallagher bends the chip in

It deflects off Nigel Winterburn

And Coventry City have their fourth corner of the game

and they go ahead of Arsenal on the flag kick count

and they still lead by a goal to nil  in a league of its own

And they have this corner kick

and it will be taken by Dave Smith I think it is who 's gone across to take it

Dave Smith has Gallagher inside the six yard area

In front of him he has Furlong

Making a run now towards the edge of the box is Andy Pearce

Flick

and it comes towards the near post

Important header for Colin Pates

Gets the header twists his head and knocks it out of play at about for about ten or fifteen yards

It 's knocked over the top though

It was returned by Stewart Robson who just planted an intelligent header over the top of the breaking Arsenal defenders

They were trying to come out and catch Gallagher offside

They didn't

Gallagher was able to turn but David Seaman beat him in the chase for the ball

Seaman then throws out to Lee Dixon

Dixon

That 's a nice ball down the right hand touchline

And Merson 's got a couple of yards in here to work the cross in

Across goes Billings to cover

In comes the cross towards the far post

Ogrizovitch is beaten

Wright heads down

Can Smith turn it in

No

Ogrizovitch  drops down on it

Recovers well the big goalkeeper 

He lost it in the fight then for this right-hand touchline and uh he was uh a little bit fortunate perhaps to get away with it

Second division score Brighton nil Leicester two from the 

Paul Kitson gets it

That 's his sixth goal of the campaign

Leicester not uh quite as useful away from home as they are at Fulworth Street this season

They won twice away with the one draw and four defeats

If they win a couple more they really would be up there with the Middlesboroughs and the Charltons of this world

David Rocastle now just outside the centre circle

David Rocastle couldn't get enough meat on the cross-field ball

Oh that 's a terrible challenge by Tony Adams

That will that will be a warning

Oh certainly a warning

Probably a yellow card

David Rocastle lost it in midfield

Coventry nudged it forward

and Furlong tried to clip it just flick it wide of Tony Adams and turn past the Arsenal skipper  who went crunching in from behind

Beaten for pace on the turn

and uh he will get a yellow card here

I don't think there 's much doubt about that

Yes

Welcome back to Highbury

Six minutes of this second match of these fourteen tournaments

Arsenal against the Greek champions Panathinaikos

The Gunners of course defending the league championship

but important build up for uh George Graham

They 've won this tournament uh twice in the past against Spurs and Porto and they 'll hopefully meet Sampdoria in tomorrow 's final the Italian league champions so impressive in their six one drubbing of West Ham

To come John Hollins Alan Ball the team news from Arsenal the team that George Graham has put in for this game against the Greek champions

We 've been playing uh as I say just over six minutes

Paul Davis forces the first corner of the match on that far side

It 's Panathinaikos nil Arsenal nil

Welcome back to Highbury as Anders Limpar 's rather clumsy challenge gives the Greek champions a free kick just a few yards inside the Arsenal half

It was late on the number two Apostolatis

And uh well Panathinaikos the top club in Greece they won the championship in uh no uncertain terms  finished eight points clear of their nearest rivals Olympiakos

and uh old Limpar just getting a short ticking off by the referee

The winners will go through to tomorrow 's final as I was mentioning to meet Sampdoria

We 'll run through the Arsenal line-up

They 've been on a a pre-season tour of Sweden

They played last Friday at uh Plymouth which was a very physical game by all accounts

And all these players out here playing for first team places

And well possible defensive slip-up there

Ball let the ball go and uh well Seaman had to be extremely quick and agile there to dive at the feet of the Greek forward

It 's David Seamon in goal

Lee Dixon wears two

Nigel Winterburn three

David Hilliar big season in uh front of him the promising youngster four

Steve Ball was probably the most improved player at Arsenal last season

He wears five

Tony Adams the skipper six

David Rocastle seven

Break off in what could pass for an opportunity

No

Flag up far side

Put through quite nicely with a short right foot

Keeper managed to parry it

Linesman 's flag up far side

Rocastle I was saying an important season for him

He wears seven

He was on the fringe of the England squad just two seasons ago

Injury and loss of form really

Well he suffered badly from both in the last couple of seasons and he 's got an opportunity maybe to impress watching manager George Graham

Eight is Paul Davis

Quite a week for him having uh  played against Celtic  Liam Brady uh and Charlie Nicholas in that testimony here at Highbury on Tuesday

Nine is Harry Groves

Ten Paul Merson

Eleven is Anders Limpar

And George Graham can call on O'Leary Kohl Linniken and Thomas

At the moment well the Gunners are having to defend as Savavakos brings that up

the right side played into the penalty box

And there 's plenty of green shirts there

And uh Vasiche was ready for a shot which uh

Well Arsenal blocked the danger

Come away on that far side with Rocastle

Slips it up to halfway

Merson tries to keep it in play

Comes off a Panathinaikos player

It will be an Arsenal uh  throw on halfway

Merson 'll take it quickly

Then just hooked back by Paul Davis for Lee Dixon

Looks forward for support

Limpar 's in a bit of space

But uh decides instead does Dixon to uh play it back into his own half

To Dixon who squares it to Bould

Bould is inside the centre circle

Then just punches that ball forward for Davis

Davis centre field for Arsenal

Short ball to his left to Hillier

Hillier will slip it out to his left to Winterburn

Winterburn

A low ball aimed towards the edge of that Panathinaikos penalty box

Looking to pick up Harry Groves again

The flag goes up far side

And it 's a chance to bring back Alan Ball who 's uhm a real exponent and expert on Greek football



















Lee Dixon nearly putting through his own net there with uh a wayward back pass

And uh Seaman was scrambling to reach that

It 's gone for a corner

Still a little bit of history about Panathinaikos

Alan was saying about when he played against the Greek side for Everton

They 'd reached the European Cup final

They were also knocked out of the eighty-five semi-final of the Champions Cup by Liverpool

So they have a a good pedigree in European competition

And they are as I say by far the best side in Greece

And they 've uh started fairly positively in the opening twelve minutes

They have a corner right side

That will be uh swung across

Well a left foot there

But uh Seaman was well behind it and he can put that up first time

Bounces once

Groves is trying to get on the end of it

There 're two Panathinaikos players back there

And Joseph Fansic the keeper will uh be there to save the day and uh

Well right foot

First time

Punched that forward

Adams is underneath it

Falls nicely for Davis

Davis slips it forward to Limpar

Limpar

Oh

lovely skills by the uh Swedish winger

and now a chance to slide it out to his left to Winterburn

Looking for players who 're waiting at the far post

Groves is there

So is Rocastle

Leaves it for Merson

Merson

Well short square ball for Limpar

Limpar lets it run for Hillier

Hillier tries to just poke that forward

Second chance

This time Hillier does find his man

Lobs it out to that right

Now Dixon can unleash that cross towards the far post

Meant for Limpar

And Apostolatis with a header 

Well for a corner which Anders Limpar will take

And that 's more like it for Arsenal looking of course to win this tournament for a third time

Steve Bould trots forward to add his height to this corner which will be taken I 'm sure whipped across by Anders Limpar

Bould comes to the near post

It 's played over the head of him and the Greek keeper

No problems there with that

And uh well in a hurry because uh he spots Vasiche forward the only quick player in that Arsenal half

But loses out on that uh far flank the uh left side for Pana Panathinaikos to uh Dixon

And Dixon will just deliver it to uh David Seaman

and Seaman can roll it out

and Arsenal can start again with uh David Hillier

Played some important games for Arsenal in that championship season and uh  I 'm sure  will have a a place in this Arsenal line-up this season

One of the young players to look for David Hillier

Another move by the Gunners

Comes to very little and in fact the ball trundles out of play just down below us near side

We 're high up here in the press box looking down on this uh Panathinaikos side attacking from left to right with an almost all-green outfit all-green strip

But they 're on the defence now

Limpar ooh trying to combine well with Merson

But good defensive work though

Panathinaikos can uh bring it forward out of their own half this time on the near right side with Savavakos

He just plays a cross-field ball and uh Christodovulo is there

Now he finds Kalatsis

Strange names these

so we will apologise for pronunciation

Not too often that we 've seen Panathinaikos at Highbury for many many years

Quite some time

Paul Davis of course played against the Greek side ten years ago

It 's a sign of how long Davis 's been at uh Highbury

Fourteen years

Spent his entire career here Davis

and uh  well was uh rewarded with a a testimonial that attracted a good crowd on Tuesday night against Celtic here at Highbury

Tony Adams the black armband signifying he 's the skipper of this Arsenal side out to his left finds uh  Winterburn

Winterburn

Well Merson shouting for it inside

and still Winterburn just drops it off to Limpar

Now Limpar

Well

He 's got to try and get past Marangos

Still Limpar

Now finds uh Winterburn

Too many uh  green shirts there and Marangos can bring this forward up towards uh halfway

They 're quick to break out of defence the Greeks 

Again  Kalatsis involved in this attack

and then he can push it wide out to the left

Double champions Panathinaikos 

A new team to this  tournament

D' you remember last season Real Sociedad and Aston Villa competed with Sampdoria

And Arsenal Panathinaikos and West Ham welcomed in to this four team tournament by the organise organise organisers

Throw well  taken

And then a free kick given quickly which is floated forward

Great opportunity for a cross which came in from Savavakos but uh came to nothing

But there are some uh early signs that uh maybe it won't be as one-sided as as we all thought

They 're the ten to one outsiders for these tournaments

Uhm possibly the third weakest side behind Arsenal and Sampdoria











































Yes Anders Limpar

And there 're players forward

Merson to the right

Davis to the left

And Groves has uh joined that Arsenal strike force but uh

Well  Limpar tried to uh  put a neat little back heel  into the path of Paul Merson

Came to little

but still the Gunners  forward momentum

Hillier picking out Dixon

Dixon with a low ball down that right side finds Merson

And it 's out of play

They are the uh as I was saying the champions in the cup as well as the league Panathinaikos

Their cup triumph their fourth in six seasons

and they 're involved in the European Cup this season

They have a first round maybe simple task against uh an Icelandic side Reykjavik

So maybe Panathinaikos will be uh progressing well in Europe this season

There 's some lovely play out on that far side

Merson linking up well with Groves

But the cross headed away by the Greeks

Winterburn will try and play it back in

He 's found Limpar gets past the defender and slips it in to Rocastle and Rocastle three yards out buries it

No one picks up David Rocastle

The skills of Anders Limpar led to that goal and Rocastle after two seasons of mental torment and mental agony notches his first goal in this pre-season build up and Arsenal forge ahead

Twenty-six minutes remaining of this first half

Rocastle with the first strike of this game

Arsenal one Panathinaikos nil

No change to that scoreline Derek except that eighteen minutes remain 

Arsenal one Panathinaikos nil

David Rocastle then setting Arsenal on the way as you 've heard that simple finish

Good work from Andreas Limpar

and uh Limpar with an effort a chip from outside the penalty box which uh brought a good save out of Joseph van name

Panathinaikos to their credit have brought a positive approach into this game

They 're inside the Arsenal penalty box looking for a penalty there

Uh Winterburn was involved in a challenge

Not a push

but I think the Greeks thought it was

and the player that uhm John Hollins was uh mentioning Josakropolis came close to to really equalising

He was uh put in well there by Savavakos and tried to slide the ball into the net from no more than a few yards out

That was just a couple of minutes ago

But uh it 's not as one-sided as many would 've thought

and I don't think that uh Arsenal have won this game by uh by any means

and they are bringing the ball forward

They are making a a match of this and a spectacle of a match

and that 's great because we don't want it to uh to die on its feet after the uh enjoyment of the first match when Sampdoria really showed us the very best of Italian football with some beautiful skills and some wonderful goals to watch

One nil



















Dixon gets that cross in

headed away well there by Kalatsakas and uh well finally hammered away deep into the Arsenal half but uh straight through to David Seaman

and Seaman will just play it short for Bould

Bould had an excellent season last year

Now Hillier 's on the half way

He can just push that forward

Now can Rocastle keep the momentum going

Rocastle

Well three or four green shirts are around him

Dixon 's to his right

Bould thought about lifting it into the uh the path of Dixon

Now finds him at the second time of asking

Dixon has not enough room to manoeuvre a couple of yards in from that far side the Arsenal right

and uh well it 's come from the right of the left side

and Winterburn will just keep it in play

Bould is the only other player in his own half

Addams has come to support

He 's out on that far side Bould

He slides it forward

Now Rocastle shrugs off one challenge

And and while we wait for them to come down towards us from the Mansion House they 'll be coming in a few moments  time to recall perhaps the fact that there has been some debate about this parade 

It 's been asked whether it was appropriate because the issues that provoked the conflict are not yet resolved  that we should celebrate or remember the the war when so much misery remains

But there is no jingoism in this parade and the cro the crowds here are in no sense by any stretch of the imagination  jingoistic

They 're listening watching waiting with respect and one suspects a great deal of affection 

This parade i is intended  to be what many of those who did their duty out in the Gulf believe they are owed  a thank you 

And who one wonders is to gainsay them 

The band of the Scots Guards continues to entertain the crowd 

Everyone is waiting now for the arrival of the Queen 

It was the Queen of course who gave to Norman Schwarzkopf  the knighthood that makes him now Sir Norman  bestowed on him on her recent visit to the United States

It was an honour  that obviously made the burly chest even of the general swell with pride 

In the  Mansion House now under an awning which keeps them dry  are those who 've been invited by the Lord Mayor by the City of London to join the Queen as she takes this salute 

Over there now the Prime Minister John Major and his wife Norma Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd Defence Secretary Tom King  leader of the opposition Neil Kinnock and his wife Glenys  Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown and Mrs Ashdown  the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who of course played a key part in the build-up before the Conservative party removed her from office

With her Sir Denis Thatcher 

The Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke is there

and other defence ministers Archy Hamilton the Earl of Arran Kenneth Carlisle 

General Sir Richard Vincent who is the new Chief of Defence Staff 

alongside the former Chief of Defence Staff Sir David Craig who you may remember in the early days of the war  facing the media barrage on television

and not always  apparently with great delight 

Elsewhere in the  seated dignitaries there 

General Peter De La Billi&egrave;re Peter De La Billire who was of course Field Commander 

Air Chief Marshall Sir Patrick Kyne  who was in overall command based here in Britain  

the former chief of the defence staff and senior military figures 

There 're also the ambassadors

The American ambassador newly appointed Ray Sykes

ambassadors from Europe and the  Middle East especially and notably from Syria and Egypt which of course were critical components  of the coalition against Saddam Hussein  as well as the ambassadors of Saudi Arabia which originally asked for the allied coalition  to come to save his country and Kuwait which was liberated  but which today 

incidentally the Americans have asked the Government to go gently with those who have been arrested and put on trial charged with collaborating  with the Iraqis 

Around behind the band of the Scots Guards  is the statue of Wellington appropriately there perhaps Britain 's finest military commander after the Peninsular Campaign which culminated in the Battle of Waterloo 

He is in some ways I suppose the  the father of British armed forces and many of the uniforms that are worn today in the British army in fact originate with him 

The Mansion House itself  is a fine neoclassical building  sustained by a portico of six corinthian columns which supports a sculptured pediment which speaks  idealistically of the City representing the dignity and opulence of the City

And now I can see the Prime Minister  John Major

There 's a cheer from the crowd as he arrives 

Smiles at the crowd

Sits down

Beside him Norma his wife 

Tom King  and the Foreign Secretary with them 

And some more ambassadors arriving 

Middle Eastern ambassadors lots of military uniforms  going to take their place 

I was saying that the  the portico representing the dignity and opulence of the City of London  has the figure of London at the top wearing a turreted crown trampling on Envy and accompanied by figures of Plenty in the corner  opposite a decidedly comfortable-looking reclining figure of the river god Thames 

We 're still waiting for the first detachments of the Gulf parade to come by us 

They will be here in a very few moments

The crowd here is really very thick despite the weather

It 's  on the streets immediately outside Princes Street which is to my left from the position where I 'm looking just above  scores upon scores of photographers 

They 're standing nine ten deep 

Smiling faces 

old young people from the City

people who 've obviously made a journey to come here 

maybe amongst them families and friends 

And now  just about to arrive is Her Majesty the Queen

She has arrived  beside the Lor Lord Mayor

She comes to the dais  and in a moment there will be a fanfare from the R A F  College Cadet Band to welcome her 



And at that moment  the  the first part of the parade is passing in front of the Queen

The City Marshall saluting her now 

With behind her Brigadier Patrick Cordingley  commander of the Seventh Armoured  Brigade

And  now  behind them the Marine  the band of the Royal Marines playing A Life on the Ocean Waves under the Director of Music Captain Gosse 

And the members of the band simply all served as medical assistants on board the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Argus 

Followed by four detachments of the Royal Navy the ships that went to the Gulf the destroyers Cardiff and Gloucester York the frigates Brazen  Battleaxe  and London and the mine hunters as well and the ships not yet here but still at sea 

The destroyers Exeter Manchester the frigates Brave and Brilliant still on their way back through the Red  Sea

their crews not forgotten here 

Just tell you who would like to I 'm sure know that the Queen is standing beside the Duke of Edinburgh 

In the middle

and on her right is standing the Lord Mayor of London

She is wearing  a lime green suit carrying  a dark blue I think handbag  white gloves  and a pale hat  with a  rather pretty lime green bobble in it

Not a good word but a bobble 

And now following  about to come into our view coming into our view now  the detachments from the army 

The combined bands of the Royal Armoured Corps the Fifth Enniskillen Dragoon Guards the Queen 's Royal Irish Hussars the Forty-seventh Forty-seventh Dragoon Guards 

And as they come by the statue of Wellington they should be playing they promised to be playing the tune Wellington 

Which number is it 

And now as he watches on from the Mansion House  let 's hear what their commanding officer  General Peter De La Billi&egrave;re Peter De La Billire is thinking at this moment 

Coming by now are the first armoured divisions



There 's no weapons here of course at all on show today 

And then now another detachment from the Fourth Armoured Brigade  the Challenger  tanks uh of significance

and performed allegedly extremely well out there 

They 're followed by detachments of the contingent of the British Army of the Rhine the rest of the Desert Rats  being the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards the Queen 's Royal Irish Hussars 

And you can hear now the pipes and drums of the Queen 's Royal Irish Hussars and the Queen 's Own Highlanders playing  Scotland the Brave as they come by in front  of where the Queen is standing taking this salute 

And now the last of the army contingents comes by 



Following them now marching up towards the statue of Wellington  the central band of the Royal Air Force playing the R A F 's march-past under Director of Music Flight Lieutenant Robert Whitley

He leads five detachments of the Royal Air Force 

Let 's hear their march past for a moment as well 

The five detachments of the Air Force who are marching past now don't know

but if they did know they would be mightily pleased I 'm sure to know that the fixed wing fly-past which had been cancelled  is in fact on again albeit in slightly  modified form 

These are the men of course who flew the Tornados the Jaguars and the reconnaissance Nimrods 

Now the last detachment of the Air Force is about to salute

They 've just eyes left and they 're saluting now to the royal dais 

Prince Charles  is up there as well with the Princess of Wales

Prince Charles  as you know is making  uhm cancelling his engagements deciding he had to be here for this day

They 're marching off now down Poultry past the buildings that are  uhm threatened or promised depending on your point of view by development by Peter Palumbo down towards the Guildhall where they 're going to be addressed by the Prince of Wales  and treated there to a luncheon to say thank you 

Back here now the crowds are watching expectantly 

Her Majesty the Queen  is like everyone else

I don't know whether she knows whether it was cancelled or not cancelled waiting for the fixed-wing fly-past 

There is an  uncharacteristic quiet as people clearly not quite certain what comes next 

The jets are still still  being expected



They 're they 're now flying over us



Okay Julian

Thank you

I must say standing here almost under  the Royal Exchange building it was a very dramatic sight because  it was like being at the end of a runway as these great planes roared over just above your head 

Julian there was referring to the casualties that uhm were endured by the air force 

There were of course other casualties of war as well

it ought not to be forgotten

Not those necessarily at the front

but also in the the kinds of accidents that invariably attend a huge and rapid deployment of military might 

Robert Lee was one of those accidents he lost his arm in this way 

Now the band of the S of the Scots Guards has started to play again 

I think they 're playing Cock of the North

Yes

They are playing Cock of the North

And listening to them  in the Mansion House  attentively is the Queen 

And along the row I can see  John Major

I saw him smiling and pointing up as the  fly-past came by

Douglas Hurd there looking up at the sky still hopefully 

Tom King chatting away with Neil Kinnock sharing  some joke 

Mrs Kinnock dressed very elegantly in in green  wearing a straw  hat with a ribbon around it 

And now the band of the Scots Guards are marching by

They 've been on duty here from well before the parade started entertaining this crowd 

They now come by to have their moment  in front of the Queen as she takes their salute

They now salute

Let 's listen to them 

And now the just disappearing from our sight down towards the Mansion House the band of the Scots Guards

And in a moment  Her Majesty will leave the dais

She 's waving now down to the crowd

You can hear them ro roaring their approval 

The Duke of Edinburgh just behind her in air force uniform

They now turn to go back  into the Mansion House  followed by  the Prince of Wales the Princess of Wales waving dressed in a  green suit  with her characteristic elegance 

And behind them now John Major waves and gets a cheer as he leaves

Ambassadors the politicians follow 

and soon they will begin to  disappear from that dais

The crowd here shows no sign of disappearing at the moment

It is as I said before a large crowd and seven sixty seventy deep immediately opposite me on the right of the Royal Exchange and to the left of the Scottish Provident building  these great institutional buildings in the centre in the heart of the City

And on all the buildings around you can see  people office workers leaning out of their windows out on the balconies

The rain 's eased off

It 's disappeared 

The flags aren't flying but you have the sense here that people want to see a bit more 

Photographers know there 's not a lot more 

They 've started to  wrap up their  equipment

Good morning

Welcome to Westminster Abbey on a grey cold Thursday in Holy Week

Maundy Thursday indeed

Here close by the buildings of the mother of parliaments the two world-famous west towers of the Abbey soar two hundred and twenty-five feet  one containing the bells shrouded in the scaffolding of restoration 

The crowds outside and the huge congregation here inside the Abbey waited for the Queen who 's wearing a jade green coat and hat

and she 's accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh

arrive at the sturdy west doors of the Abbey

They arrived some two minutes ago

and those doors  are immediately before me in my high triforium position

but far away it seems beyond the high altar which is immediately beneath me then the sacrarium the choir and after that the nave

And shortly now as the procession moves towards me with the Cross of Westminster carried to the fore we shall hear the hymn Praise to the Holiest in the Height and in the Depths be Praised

The processions move towards the first representatives of other Christian churches  as the sounds of this much loved hymn Praise to the Holiest in the Height rise to the height of the magnificent gothic vaulting of the nave almost a hundred and two feet

The Cross of Westminster comes sedately down

when members of the Brotherhood of Saint Edward the Confessor who founded the first abbey here in ten sixty-four

The clergy of Westminster Abbey are in this second procession as are the Church 's laymen and Her Majesty the Queen with the Duke of Edinburgh

Then the time-honoured procession of the Royal Almonry a most colourful spectacle

As there are Yeomen of the Guard positioned round the Abbey in their Tudor scarlet black and gold tunics so there are three in this third procession carrying on their heads great dishes bearing the alms  purses of red and white

And behind them are the four minute figures of the Children of the Royal Almonry

The proud recipients watch the processions pass awaiting a ceremony which goes back almost eight hundred years but the roots are far deeper in the Gospel according to Saint John

After the Last Supper Jesus wrapped a towel around himself poured water into a basin and washed the feet of his disciples 

It 's why this service will begin with Christ 's command



That 's where the word maundy comes from

The Latin word for commandment is mandatum 

Soon now we shall hear the Lord High Almoner the Right Reverend John Taylor the Bishop of Saint Albans reading those very words

and after the mandatum reading and prayers we shall hear Psalm a hundred and thirty-eight I Will Give Thanks unto Thee O Lord with my Whole Heart 

Also in these processions we 've seen representatives as I 've said of other churches of the Christian faith besides the Anglicans reflecting that since  nineteen eighty-six there 's been a whole new ecumenical flavour to the service

In the first procession were representatives of the Quakers the Salvation Army so busy in the streets of London of course even in these modern times the Methodist church the United Reform Church the Baptist Union of Great Britain the Roman Catholics  whose Westminster Cathedral is indeed less than a mile from here down Victoria Street and of course the Church of Scotland too

An ecumenical event indeed

As the final procession of the Yeomen of the Guard with their dishes approach approaches the high altar the sacrarium now the Queen is in position

And shortly we shall hear the final verse of Praise to the Holiest in the Height that beautiful descant to finish this processional hymn 

And now prayers

The Abbey Precentor the Reverend Alan Love the only member of the clergy who was here at the last Maundy Service in the Abbey ten years ago 

The Queen is now returning to her position in the sacrarium as she mounts the steps towards the high altar

And very shortly now at the conclusion of this first distribution the Dean the Very Reverend Michael May will read the second lesson from Saint Matthew chapter twenty-five 

Soon now we 'll hear perhaps the most stirring of all the anthems here this morning Zadok the Priest inspired by the first chapter of the First Book of Kings

For the moment we watch still the distribution of maundy money the second part of the distribution

Two of the uniformed yeomen one of them is six foot five inches tall this year carry the huge trays and two of those trays are different this year kept in the ancient Pyx Chamber here at the Abbey where once the Crown Jewels were stored 

One is the Rollus Plate bearing appositely the arms of Saint Edward the Confessor

the other containing a plaque head of the Last Supper

and both are seventeenth century

The recipients are standing save for a few in wheelchairs to receive the Queen 's gift

And they 're carefully looked after by six wandsmen who date from Queen Victoria 's time and who carry poles six feet long

The average age of the recipients is seventy-seven and they 're all chosen for their good Christian works and sacrifice

Again there are eight over ninety this year four men and four women and the oldest is Robert Weston who 's ninety-seven and still walks to church

So the introduction swells to its crescendo and Zadok the Priest 

Zadok the Priest by George Frederick Handel whose statue incidentally is in Poets ' Corner down to my left

And we await prayers now conducted by the Sacrist the Reverend Paul Ferguson 

Soon now the national anthem

But first the congregation stands to sing the final hymn

Again a hymn for Holy Week  When I Survey the Wondrous Cross on Which the Prince of Glory Died 

The notes of the organ swell and reverberate throughout this wonderful gothic abbey

Bach 's Fantasia and Fugue played by the Sub-Organist Andrew Lumsden

And as we watch here the three processions from the beginning of the service have condensed to one the Cross of Westminster sedately to the fore

And the unique annual ceremony of the distribution of the delicate silver maundy coins to deserving elderly people on the day before Good Friday  has ended

But who are these people who today accept alms from the Queen

What kind of people

and how are they selected for this unique award

Each of these a hundred and thirty men and women has a story to tell

Stories of a lifetime of service service to their fellow men and women often reaching back to World War Two sometimes in uniform sometimes for charity 

And so the Maundy Service of nineteen ninety-one has ended 

It was held in Westminster Abbey for some sixty years and that tradition began to change in nineteen fifty-three

Now each year it 's held at a different cathedral location and this is the first time in a decade that the Maundy has come back to this abbey church

It 's one of Her Majesty 's favourite ancient ceremonies so it 's small wonder that in her lengthening reign she 's been absent on only four occasions 

The Abbey is known as a Royal Peculiar and the Queen is its Visitor with a capital V

Indeed this dying month of March she has visited the Abbey on no less than three occasions

On Commonwealth Day  last week for the memorial service of that great friend of Britain the King of Norway

and of course again today

And as the procession has moved away from me towards the west doors the Queen and the Duke charmingly carry nosegays of spring flowers and herbs to ward off disease made again this year by Mrs Valerie Bennett-Levy and her trusty team

Also carrying nosegays are the tiny children of the Royal Almonry two chosen from a local school two having some connection with the Maundy ceremony itself

Emily Robinson Lucy Leadington-Wright James O'Connell and David Bayley all aged nine to eleven

Their most exciting day will shortly be crowned when they meet the Queen

Then there 'll be the usual official photograph followed by a royal reception in the ancient Jerusalem Chamber

And as all leave to go out into the spring-charged air of Central London and we take our leave of you  along with the organ music the words of Christ 's mandatum ring in our ears

Love one another

As well as the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland Professor Robert Davidson  the Archbishop of York and the Archbishop of Canterbury  others taking part in the service will be  Archbishop Thomas Winning the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow  and the Reverend James Harkness  Chaplain General  the only Church of Scotland Minister ever  to be principal chaplain in the British Army 

But many eyes will be on Flight Lieutenant John Peters  who was shot down  by  enemy fire during the conflict whose appearance on Iraqi television  changed much world opinion 

He will be reading one of the lessons 

The congregation have been waiting now since just after eleven o'clock 

Among them Mrs Thatcher  sitting beside George Younger  Mr Kinnock  Mr Paddy Ashdown  many members of the Cabinet 

There are large numbers of soldiers here of course  in many different uniforms and the  the ancient traditional uniforms of the Royal Company of Archers the Queen 's own bodyguard in Scotland 

Here too are the families of those who lost loved ones during the conflict  and many representatives of different churches 

Ambassadors too  ambassadors  of many different countries  here to share  in this national service 

This building Glasgow Cathedral has a special place in the affections of Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh for it was here in nineteen seventy-seven that they began the national celebrations of twenty-five years of Her Majesty 's reign with a service of thanksgiving 

And they will be sitting in the same places  at this service as they sat in then 

During the service  during the service there will be an act of dedication  which will be made by the Moderator of the General Assembly  and an act of reconcilien and pi reconciliation and peace and children of three faiths Christian Jewish and Muslim  will gather around Professor Robert Davidson  to read words of peace from their own religious traditions 

The organ which you can hear  is over a hundred years old 

it 's a Father Willis organ 

Appropriately enough  for today 's service  the first and perhaps still the most famous  organist here in Glasgow Cathedral was Dr Peace 

John Turner who  is playing the organ today has been Cathedral Organist here for over quarter of a century 

As well as the military band outside the Cathedral and the organ inside  you will also hear this morning a fanfare  a fanfare played by the fanfare trumpeters of the Royal Air Force Music Services 

There will be bagpipe music  a lament a lament which will be played by Pipe Major  Hitchens 

Pipe Major  Hitchens was born and brought up in New Zealand  but came to Scotland largely to develop his interest in bagpipe music

As he plays his lament a wreath will be laid by representatives of the Armed Services 

There will also be the sounding of the Last Post and Reveille 

Buglers of the Band of the Royal Marines 

We have been waiting for Her Majesty the Queen to arrive and we 've discovered that there has been a fault in her transport arrangements

She has been delayed

She will arrive in the Cathedral about twelve fifteen 

When she arrives she will be greeted by trumpets  when she will make her way down through the congregation 

So as we wait for her to arrive and this congregation of twelve hundred people awaits  we will  share with them in  reverence and waiting as we hear the music of the organ 

Those who are just joining us will need to know that we wait here in Glasgow Cathedral for the arrival of Her Majesty the Queen

She is delayed because of transport difficulties 

We are in this magnificent ancient building

The best parts of this building are seven hundred years old though there has been worship here for a great deal longer

Twelve hundred people are gathered here for the National Service of Remembrance and Thanksgiving 

There are people here from many parts of the world and from different cultures and different backgrounds 

They are gathered in a building which  stands on a site where there has been worship for perhaps fifteen hundred years 

It 's a tall narrow building always festooned with flags and regimental colours  and today filled with  all sorts of other brightness of colour as well as the sun streams through its magnificent stained glass windows 

Glasgow Cathedral is a church of the Church of Scotland so unlike many cathedrals it has no bishop

Its Minister is a Parish Minister Dr William Morris and he will be sharing this service with representatives of many churches  two Anglican Archbishops  and a Scottish Roman Catholic Bishop  a Free Church Minister from Wales 

And indeed many other churches are represented in the procession of clergy  which awaits the arrival of Her Majesty 

Her Majesty the Queen has a number of chaplains in Scotland Royal Chaplains

Dr Morris the Minister of Glasgow Cathedral is one of these and very soon in a few days ' time indeed he will become Dean of the Chapel Royal the leader of Her Majesty 's Ecclesiastical Household in Scotland 

Still however that office is held by Professor Robin Barber the present Dean of the Chapel Royal

and we will hear his voice during the service as he leads an Act of Remembrance during which the wreath is laid and the lament and the Last Post are sounded 

I 'm delighted to say that despite her train problems I think I can now see the black limousine arriving outside the Cathedral which will bring Her Majesty the Queen to Glasgow for this National Service of Remembrance and Thanksgiving 

Outside I can hear the crowds cheering as Her Majesty the Queen arrives with the Duke of Edinburgh to be greeted by the Minister of Glasgow Cathedral Dr William Morris one of her chaplains 

She was delayed by  train difficulties  but  appears to be cheerful as she 's welcomed  with great good humour by Dr Morris 

And he will now present her to those who are waiting inside the West Door of this great old church 

As she enters the Cathedral the congregation stands 

Her Majesty greets  those who have been waiting for her

the Prime Minister Mr John Major the Senior Secretary of State for Scotland Ian Lang  Tom King the Secretary of Defence  military chiefs General Sir Peter de la Billi&egrave;re  Sir David Craig 

And as the Queen makes her way down this long aisle  with the Lord Lieutenant of Glasgow the Lord Provost Mrs Susan Baird  and the Minister of the Cathedral Dr Morris the choir  will sing an introit by Mendelssohn 

But first Mr Major and Mr Lang are being led to their places 

As they reach the front of the Church  followed by clari clergymen Her Majesty the Queen waits at the West Door

Well may I just begin by expressing my great pleasure to see that uh  teacher education was not in any of the the white papers

That seems to me a very good uh  move indeed on the part of the Government

One learns to worry about uh presence in white papers these days 

Now my my subject uh this evening is the teaching of teachers

and uh I know it 's not best practice to start from the general and then move on to the particular

but I 'm going to do that  because I want to say something about the wider context the background as it were against which discussion about teacher education has to take place these days 

And then I 'm going to go on

and say something a a very short something I may say about teaching itself uh what it is that  teachers are or ought to be being taught to do or or encouraged to become 

I I 'm almost twenty-eight years out of the classroom so I 'm  modest about my claims to talk about that 

And in my third section I 'm going to touch upon some particular issues in teacher education and those are derived from my own observations  at the Institute of Education

A little bit more recent than than uh has been ascribed to me 

And then I uh uh uh in a burst of futurology I I will say something about  the future

It 's no good predicting it really

Uh it 's rather like trying to decide whether it will rain in the third week of August these days 

It 's It 's

But anyway I shall say something about what might be happening 

First then the  the context  the wider context within which discussion  on education of which uh teacher education 's only a part but I can't disentangle it  is taking place

And these days that discussion and you 'll be familiar with this takes really two forms 

And the first which which I have to say sounds to those who don't share this point of view  always sounds the noisier one uh is dominated by a view which I can express as follows

First of all A  that educational standards and of course teacher education is a part of this  in this country however you define them are in absolute terms going down 

B that much of the fault for this lies with with teachers and their various uh hangers-on the su so-called experts who I think uh  Prince Charles called educationists the other day  in the educational establishment 

And those of you who are sensitive uh to matters of this kind  will have heard the the quotation marks round round experts every time  that word is pronounced 

C it 's therefore important and this is how the argument runs  to do things or or to prevent other things in order to  re-establish some of the more important conditions  which enabled us to reach those higher standards in the past  because of course it 's those higher standards that we are going to require in the future 

And D and finally in the argument this requires that the people  held to be responsible  for whatever has gone wrong  that 's the the educational establishment  I 've referred to  should have constraints placed on them to enforce the necessary changes  uh because they are unlikely the argument goes having made a considerable mess of it in the past  uh to carry out those changes voluntarily 

Hence there 's a flurry of legislation blue and white and re regulations circulars and so on in in recent years 

Uh I think it 's an accelerating flurry uh as far as I can detect 

Now an alternative view 

and this is the backcloth against which discussion on teacher education takes place 

an alternative view which I happen to notice that Lor Lord Annan was uh  expressing the other day in the House of Lords and uh uh uh for what it 's worth I happen to hold myself  is uh as a country we we plainly are much less well educated than we ought to be 

but quite as plainly we 're better educated than we were in the past 

And in the uh it 's also true that in relation to a number of other countries uh uh notably our competitors in economic matters  our performance  uh our position in the educational league table on the things that you can measure sometimes  may indeed have slipped since nineteen forty-four

and some would say

since the  eighteen eighties 

I 'm not sure about that

I was uh When I was looking up the centenary of the county councils I noticed a Mr Mondella in eighteen eighty-six who knew about these things he was M P for Sheffield  pointing out that one small county one small state in in Germany was uh had more people uh taking advanced scientific uh examinations than we had in the whole of the  U K 

But anyway in relation to our own performance in nineteen forty-four any other dates you you care to pick so runs this argument  our standards have risen

As I say they ought to have risen faster

they ought to have risen further 

and responsibility for the shortcomings are is widely distributed

No less the essential point is  that relative international decline has been accompanied by absolute national improvement

Now it 's not my function here to argue the case of the second  view point though it seems to me a fairly uh evident one

It 's a task I think for the enquiry that uh Sir Klaus Moser  and the British Association have initiated with the support of the Paul Hammond Trust

But what I I do want to point out and the reason I 'm raising this in these general terms  is the debilitating effect of our failure as a country to resolve the the differences between these two  view points 

Now why are these differences so important

Because at first sight both view points  have one crucial thing in common 

Both agree that improvement is needed and should be more rapid than is now the case 

But there is all the difference in the world between the policies that one pursues  when you 're trying to prevent things getting worse  and those for insuring that improvement is more rapid than it already is

And if you to take a military analogy  uh the way that you deal with being attacked  which is rather like trying to prevent things getting worse is very different from the way  in which you encourage advance

I say this with confidence knowing nothing about military matters 

But und under attack if you think of the the the Alamo uh you know in Texas down there  there 's always uh within the attacked body uhm  strict discipline not too much fussing about the the weak and the wounded

It 's It 's It 's the Davy Crocketts of this world  who are needed to parade about on the battlements

And in those conditions when we 're under attack in that way we we tend to look out for spies we

we 're on our guard

and something of a bunker mentality  develops 

But on the other hand if we 're advancing  even though that be quite slow  quite different attitudes uh prevail

We We tend to be encouraging the troops

We reward enterprise We

We support initiative

We do quite different things 

Now uh just to digress for a moment

uhm wh

why is this view that standards are in absolute rather than relative terms declining so so powerfully and I I 'm sure sincerely held 

Now I I 'm no psychologist at all

but it it this view does seem to  derive and it 's very sincerely held from  uh some form of idealized past

We all seem to have it

Every generation has it

It 's some sort of thirty years a ago 

and in this case it it seems to conjure up a past when people were more orderly and they were more obedient and  and bobbies used to walk the beat in uh a friendly way 

And to those uhm people with a vision of that kind that 's a very powerful vision 

The whole turbulence and opening up of society in the nineteen sixties and the shifting attitudes which derive perhaps from that period  are are deeply troubling

And what has happened since is perceived to be  a falling-away from something which in those days was better 

I In educational terms I find it very difficult myself to adjust t to that

Uhm if I may take uh London in nineteen  seventy

Now that 's not very long ago uhm 

Forty-two out of two hundred and twenty-three secondary schools in London  weren't

they weren't grammar schools they weren't comprehensive schools they weren't secondary modern schools

The Department of Education could only bring itself to describe them as other 

Now th they all

Nobody ever heard of them

Nobody sent their children to them

The papers weren't interested in them 

But they were there and they 're not there now 

And that which is there now i ha ought to be a lot better than it is  but is a great deal better than it was 

Anyway what is required on that vision of the past is some radical reversion to that past 

And the problem with that radical vision and the way it is affecting I think all the ways in which people are now trying to think about what we should be doing uh in the future  is that that notion that vision is is logically it 's logically prior to  the notion of falling standards

In other words the notion of worsening educational standards reflects the decision about how to interpret the evidence  rather than anything derived from the evidence itself 

And as such a notion of that kind is not really susceptible to  any kind of modification in the in the face of further evidence

And you can test it

If you If you say that the proportion of people gaining A levels or something of that kind has gone up  uh this isn't taken as evidence that standards are improving

It 's It 's simply interpreted it has to be as evidence that the standard of A level for example is going down 

Because on this on this theory and it 's very deeply held uh good educational news is by definition inadmissible as evidence 

Now we 're up against here what uh those of you who used to used to uh think about these things Archie Collingwood used to call absolute presuppositions  about which people uh used to say were distinctly ticklish when they 're challenged

Anyway so much for speculation

What I think is undeniable  in relation to the context is that this view of decline from some better past leads to some thoroughly undesirable features so far as discussion of educational issues  the educational context I 've been talking about is concerned

I In effect they make uh sensible debate almost impossible 

Now I shall run through them

But these features

and they 'll be familiar to you

I think

they include such things as uh uh a a a certain distrust of fact

I mean royal commissions are not popular

There 're all sorts of reasons why one doesn't like them maybe but but they 're not popular at all in in the public mind 

Uhm uh uh a distrust of those in a position to observe what 's happening the m the messengers of fact 

Uh for example you know people like H M I are not popular

One can't say that they get a good press 

This is not a political point

I mean I remember uh th there being no thirty year rule in the Government

I remember Ken Livingstone walking out on Sheila Brown once uh when she came to talk to us about what we were doing wrong in some respect which we listened to with attention

But  I remember him walking out in a great rage saying

you know this is a total setup by the whatever whatever it is

I noticed Mr Dunn the other day  ex-minister saying it wa all these reports were very dull 

All these things seem to be partial reflection anyway of the people  uh making these comments 

Now th a third approach that I think is worrying is is is the highly uh polemical one  and as an extension of that arguments uh specifically directed against the person attacking what  th the person is represented to be than whatever the person is supposed to be saying or doing

And there 's a very virulent form of this which I find very difficult to deal with 

And that is the assumption that everybody always acts out of self-interest  in defence of whatever position they happen to hold or institution they in which they work 

You know they would s it 's a sort of Mandy Rice-Davis thing that he you know they would say that wouldn't they

Seems to be quite impossible for anybody within a university to be believed to be actually upholding certain values

It 's only because they you know like their uh uh  pay regularly or whatever it is 

Right well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen

I 'm Simon James from the education service and today 's  lecture  the very last lecture before Christmas  uh is The Ancient Celts Through Caesar 's Eyes 

Gaul as a whole divided into three parts  one of which is inhabited by the Belgae another by the Aquitani  and a third by the people called in their own tongue Celtae  in the Latin Galli  or Gauls 

These of course are the famous opening words  of Julius Caesar 's  commentaries  on the Gallic wars  uh  his  uh conquest of Gaul which took place during the fifties  BC 

And uh it 's this document  which is really the subject  of today  uh 

and it is  the  most precious and the largest document which tells us  about the ancient Gauls the people who lived in  what 's roughly today France  ah in the period up to the Roman conquest of the fifties B C by Julius Caesar 's legions 

Uhm it 's not the only document we 've got referring to this uh  people 

ah there are a number of others but ah Julius Caesar 's eyewitness account of his operations  ah is  certainly the most extensive and important 

The Gauls themselves  are were parts of the much larger  family of Celtic-speaking peoples who in the last centuries B C  occupied all the brown bits you see  on this map 

Uhm archaeologists are still arguing to what extent they originated in one place and migrated to all these other bits and pieces of  uh Europe  uhm 

Some archaeologists think that they actually developed in a number of parts of western Europe and only a few parts of this uh  area  were actually  uh occupied as a result of the invasions and migrations 

Certainly Well the main part we 're going to be concentrating on is of course the central area of Gaul  France proper over there 

There were Celts of course in the British Isles the ancient Britons and the ancient Irish 

Uh perhaps less familiarly there were Celts in western  uh peninsular Spain  uh and in the uh uh Po valley of i Italy and points East 

There were uh uh was an increasingly sparse scattering of Celtic-speaking peoples down the Danube 

And perhaps the most forgotten Celts of them all  are the uh the Gaul the the Gallic-speaking or Celtic-speaking people who broke into Turkey in the third century B C  to form the kingdom of the Galatians  whose name of course appears in the  New Testament

These were  Celtic-speaking people who had distant cousins in Gaul  ah and the British Isles 

But that 's  something of a side issue

The ancient Celts then were a  a mosaic of related peoples who occupied much of western and central Europe in the last centuries B C  ah  the last great flowering of European prehistoric culture perhaps but which was largely absorbed by  the expanding  uh might of Rome 

Uhm  let 's move on 

And we know quite a lot about them from Greek and Roman writers but  because they were a non-literate group of peoples for the most part  we know next to nothing about them from their own  sources 

Ah the only Celtic documentary sources we 've really got  are the later ones from Ireland  which was never part of the uh classical world  ah and when it became evangelised by Saint Patrick uhm some of the Irish traditions became written down by Christian clerics of Irish origin 

And so we have something of an independent Celtic literary tradition from there 

But for the most part we have to look at the ancient Gauls through the eyes of Greeks and Romans  uh or perhaps more accurately through their writings  uhm which of course is not necessarily the same thing

What people write is not always the same as what they actually think  especially when politics are involved

And where the Celts were concerned politics and especially military affairs  uh were very important indeed

Here is a rather splendid reconstruction of some of the uh ancient Celts from north of the Alps  sorts of people who invaded Italy in the fourth century B C  and who sacked Rome in three ninety  uh which was a a major uh  psychological blow to the Roman state

It was the Roman Pearl Harbour I suppose really 

The Romans uh reacted very strongly to this  uh

and thereafter for many centuries they had a fear of this perilous  uh power of this wild barbarian group of peoples to the north  uhm  who seemed to be a constant threat to  uhm  Roman security 

Not surprisingly there were prolonged wars during the last centuries B C between the Celts and the Romans

Of course the Romans were also fighting and conquering many other peoples 

Ah but the Celts were gradually overrun in northern Italy  they were uh annihilated or driven out or forcibly assimilated  and the Romans gradually started to expand to other Celtic areas in Spain  and then into France 

Uhm they were  occupying the south of France in the second century B C 

And  of course Caesar 's great contribution to Roman expansion was the conquest of the majority of Gaul  during his governership  of uhm northern Italy and southern France  uh in the fifties B C 

This was a spectacular  series of military operations  which included not only  the rapid overrunning of Gaul  but also included the first Roman operations across the Rhine into Germany  where Caesar built his favourite uh famous bridge over the Rhine in seven days flat  uh partly as a way of overawing the Germans astonishing them with Roman military  skill technology and power  uh and then carried a punitive operation the other side of the Rhine

and also  in fifty five and fifty four B C  his two  uh famous raids  on Britain 

These really perhaps were the moments of the beginning of British  history in a way  uhm because he left us the first eyewitness account of the ancient Britons

But of course that 's not our main theme today

We are mainly concerned with his operations in Gaul itself 

Caesar was  responsible  uh in large part for forming the long-term historical picture  of the ancient Gauls and indeed of course of the ancient Britons 

And here 's a a reconstruction painting

The figure at the back  uh is a modern attempt to reconstruct an ancient Briton based partly on what Caesar tells us about them  with the famous blue painting  uh and the alleged dressing up in skins and so on 

Uhm but archaeology and modern historiography have tended to suggest  that uh Caesar is not to be taken at his word  that there are things wrong with Caesar

He 's an in a very inadequate and dangerous source  to use if we 're trying to understand  what the ancient Gauls  and their cousins the Britons and so on were really like 

And  well this is not surprising because there are problems inherent to almost all documentary sources and indeed archaeological sources 

There are all sorts of  problems we have to try to assess to  decide whether they 're giving us a balanced and accurate view  of antiquity 

I 've already given some hints that uh the Romans had certain prejudices about the Celts in general perhaps the Gauls in particular of what they were actually like 

They were  a barbarian and fearsome people to the North  uh who were regarded as a as a constant threat 

By the first century B C the Romans due to their success in the Mediterranean had come to decide as so many imperial powers do that because of their success they must be favoured of the gods and were probably better than everybody else

So they also had come not only to perhaps fear the Gauls but rather despise them perhaps as inferior people in some ways

On the one hand 

That 's one view one sense you get from looking at Roman writings 

The Romans also looked down on the Greeks

And the Greeks looked down on the Romans as being upstart barbarians themselves 

Uh so  in that sense racial prejudices or national prejudices were very common in the ancient world as they are  uh in more recent times 

So on the one hand then people looking down on the Gauls

On the other there was the view of the Gauls as being somehow admirable noble savages 

This again is a a a view of other peoples which uh is recurrent  through history

Perhaps that is personified by this famous statue called the dying Gaul  uh which you can see on the Capitoline in Rome which is a a Roman copy of a a Hellenistic Greek original

In fact it doesn't show a Gaul of France

it shows one of the Galatians of Turkey  distant cousins of the Gauls  uh from a a a Greek victory monument after one of the defeats of the Gauls

And then you see this beautiful  ah marble statue of a naked Celt who often fought in the nude one way of terrifying the opposition I suppose  but with his  uhm neck ring famous torque you see around his throat here  his Celtic moustache and his spiky haircut that so many Celts actually  uh liked to sport 

So that was another way of looking at them 

And uh there are hints  of both of these views of of regarding the the the Celts as inferior and regarding them as rather  rather noble savages and that we have lost something in becoming civilised that these people still have or recently had 

Uh but uh  uh these things show through to an extent in in Caesar  and other writers 

Uhm now that 's something to bear in mind when we look at Caesar 's writings 

We must also of course look in more detail at the specific context in which he was writing  because good old Julius Caesar here was not writing for the benefit of twentieth-century archaeologists and historians 

He says in his commentaries that uh or gives you the impression that he 's tried to write for posterity so that the future will know what actually happened

Uh and there was  to an extent a con concept of uh some kind of objective history really in the classical world although not per perhaps highly developed

But the reality of Caesar 's commentaries are rather different

They were political propaganda 

He was writing as we think year by year at the end of each campaign  for the benefit  of public opinion in Rome 

Uhm

what he was doing was writing political pamphlets explaining what he was up to in Gaul and why he was doing it

And if you look at Caesar 's career  you can get a bit of a better idea as to why he felt the need to do this

Here we are at the centre of Rome the the Forum

In the period when he was writing in the fifties  uh he was reaching the climax of his career 

he was in fierce and eventually bloody  competition  with other senior figures in the Roman state for power and prestige  ultimately the control of the state

And his uh protagonist was becoming  uh the other great general of the period  Pompey the Great that you see an alleged portrait of here  ah who had who was another senator as Julius Caesar was one of the ruling elite of the Roman state anyway  but who had gained vast personal wealth and power and prestige in the state  by  conquering large parts of the Eastern Mediterranean and sorting out the political setup to Roman tastes there  coming home with huge sums of money 

Uhm

Caesar was initially allied with him against the Roman government  the the official government the Senate itself  uh whose most famous member of this period was uh the writer Cicero  who was trying to preserve the old Republican values against the growing independence and power of warlords like Pompey and Caesar 

Eventually  Pompey and Caesar were to fall out 

Uh Caesar faced uh obliteration if he could not hang on to power in his governorships in Gaul 

He 'd got the governorships in Gaul partly to restore his fortune his personal fortune

Julius Caesar to get to the top  of the greasy pole  uh in the Roman state  had increasingly had to use illegal means 

All  Roman  uh officials ha really had to do it at this period 

Uhm

to get the vast sums of money you needed for basically election bribes and electioneering  uhm you had to get  provincial governorships and rip off the provincials  uh

you had to try to get uh main major jobs at Rome and exploit your position there

Well Chairman ladies and gentlemen uhm I 'm always very suspicious when people uh introduce me uh as being a national figure since I 've never forgotten uh the first time I uh appeared on Question Time 

Uh and after I survived the programme the uh producer explained that I was now a national figure which hadn't really occurred to me

And uh she then said well look uhm you because you 're a national figure you 've been in eight million homes tonight uh

you really must get used to the idea that people will come up to you

They 'll start asking for your autograph

And not only will they do that

but they will challenge your views uhm uh absurd views uhm on all the things you 've been pontifica pontificating about this evening 

And so my head swelled up to even more than its normal proportions and off I went into the night

Uh the following uh  uh morning as it happens uh I was uh at our home

Uh it was just before Easter and my wife uhm instructed me uh to go and get the meat from the butcher 

And so off I went to uh Thatcham uh which is where we then lived

And uhm uh somewhat to my surprise this was one hour of prime time television the night before uhm the whole of Thatcham did not come grinding to a halt

Nobody asked for my autograph

Uh

not a thing until I got to the butcher who looked at me very closely as though he recognised me which uh naturally he did since I was there quite regularly

And he looked at me

and he said

Mr Banham d' you by any chance have a very much older brother  

So I get very suspicious every time   I hear people generously  introducing me as a national figure

Uh there are very few of them about three as far as I can see

Uhm  but what I 'd like to talk about uh is uh something that I think is very important uh and related in a sense to what I was supposed to be talking about as I see uh in the invitation that has tempted people along here uh Getting Britain Moving 

Uh it seems to me that in war uh perhaps the first casualty is truth 

In business and politics  the first casualty of difficult times can all too easily be the future 

It 's very tempting I think uh to cut back investment  whether you 're in business  uh because that 's a way of propping up the share price and making sure that your the cash flow is maintained 

And in politics of course it 's all too easy uh to uh cut back uh future developments in order to fund the personal tax cuts which are invariably the key to Downing Street 

And there must be obviously a risk  in present circumstances where times are uh rather difficult although perhaps not as difficult as we all imagine  uh that one of the casualties of the present difficulties will be investment in our collective futures in the form of the transport system 

And what I 'd like to do this evening uh is to talk briefly about what needs to happen in order uh to make sure that we are able to compete effectively uh from the edge of Europe  and compete I may say in a Europe whose centre of gravity is moving very steadily uh and indeed at an accelerating pace uh south-eastwards 

And we start of course  uh with uhm uh I think a general recognition that uh we have probably the least competitive transport infrastructure in Northern Europe 

And if that wasn't bad enough it 's all pointing in the wrong direction 

Uh we have an economic geography in a sense uh which is facing our past 

Uh goods came in across the Atlantic through the west coast ports

Uh they were processed uhm in the Midlands and sold in the South 

So we have a huge arrow pointing  at London 

and our links as we all know uh elsewhere uh are uh to put it mildly uh inadequate 

Uh 

that might not have mattered uh had we  continued uh to regard uh Europe as somebody else 's problem

but of course by now over half our non-oil exports are sent uh to this single market  compared with only seventeen per cent that go to North America 

So the prospect of the United Kingdom which is only accounts for only about ten per cent of the combined gross domestic product of the European Community becoming economically marginalised is all too real

Europe could frankly get along without us perfectly happily 

Uh and it certainly isn't sitting there thinking that it owes us a living 

And unless we can get our transport infrastructure into the kind of shape  that 's going to be necessary we could well lose out in the uh coming decade and indeed in the next century  to Northern Spain  uh France and Nor Northern France and Italy  by simply failing to capitalise on the major opportunities presented by the completion of the market and the opening of the Channel Tunnel 

And it 's against this background uh that I 'd like really uh to  talk

And I 'd like to do it uhm  on uh an unlikely basis uh for any uh Director General of the Confederation of British Industry 

Uh I 'm uh uncomfortably well aware  uh of uhm uh the the legend about uh Leo Playatsky  uh who some of you may know

A formidable Treasury uh mandarin

Uhm

and at some stage uh he was p uh pontificating uh which of course was very uncharacteristic of him uhm about uhm uh the the way in which uh a particular piece of legislation would be received in the City of London 

As it happened sitting well below the salt  uh at the meeting uh was somebody from the the late lamented Central Policy Review staff a former colleague of mine  who was uhm a very junior uhm uh member of the firm of Rothschild 

Fellow called Michael Meyer

anyone of you who 've met him

He 's probably the cleverest man I 've ever met 

And Michael who as I say was sitting well below the salt  uh  flatly contradicted the great man 

And Playatsky in fact took off his glasses looked at him and said

young man  on what basis pray do you venture to contradict me 

Straight back came the answer knowledge  

And uh I may add uh that to his eternal credit and he doesn't need any eternal credit about uhm twenty minutes later Playatsky was again uh pontificating

And he stopped

and he said

my young friend at the end of the table will ask on what basis I make these judgements

and I can reply in one word experience  

But anyway uh I 'm uh this evening uh

And I was told to string this out a bit because uh  uh we 're a bit short of material here

Uhm

uh

I 'm going to talk uh on the basis of knowledge  uh since we have gone through uh a very detailed process uhm of looking at uh the needs of our members and how they see uh the uh economic geography of the country

And we published  a rather detailed account of what needed to happen  uh in a  publication called Trade Routes uh to the Future  uh which was published something like eighteen months ago 

And the great thing about publishing things is you can always look back  and see whether with the benefit of twenty-twenty hindsight you 'd say or do anything differently 

And uh this report reads  uh actually rather  uh I was going to say even better today than it did then 

And uhm what we then said was that the prospect looms of industrial Britain  being so seriously handicapped in its ability to deliver goods on time that the benefits of the single market  and of the what was then a six and a half billion and now an eight and a half billion investment in the Channel Tunnel will be felt to a greater extent in northern France than in the areas of the United Kingdom where industry is concentrated 

Since then as I said  uh the centre of gravity of Europe has moved much further eastwards while we  paradoxically have been looking much more in on ourselves preoccupied with the outcome of the next general election uh what the latest uhm survey of business opinion is thinking and so on 

Meanwhile German reunification and the move towards market economies in what was once the Warsaw Pact means that Britain will be even more distant from the economic centres of Europe 

Uh

as it is following the opening of the Channel Tu uh following the opening of the Channel Tunnel means that companies located in Northern France will be much better placed to serve for example customers in Croydon  which happens to be the seventh largest city in England than those in Bradford or further north 

Why should inward investors locate for example in the north-east of the United Kingdom or anywhere uh in these islands if their markets are on mainland Europe 

And if we fail to make the necessary investments if we continue what we are frankly doing at the present which is simply to muddle through  not very well we will be creating the very worst outlook for the our ability to compete in the next century 

Fortunately uh the message I believe is beginning to get through 

But don't underestimate the problems 

Uh the not in my back yard brigade is well entrenched 

Recent developments may have been positive

and they have been 

uh

but we need to see a lot more  a lot more urgency  uh unless we are to uh  find ourselves in ten years hopelessly handicapped in our ability to compete in what will be probably the toughest if richest market on earth 

Let me first of all talk about the good things that have happened recently uh partly but not of course by any means entirely as a result of  uh the whole uhm  uh change that 's taken place in people 's attitudes uh to the infrastructure

By the standards of the past a great deal has happened much of it very positive 

and certainly in the last eighteen months 

In January for example the Government announced a transport budget  of very close to sixteen billion for the next three financial years which is almost exactly a quarter up on the last three years 

And by the way uh those of you who know anything about uhm the in uh the economics of uh the uh building industry  will know that today  the construction industry inflation index is negative 

That is you get more bricks and mortar more miles of waytorway motorway built per million pounds  this year than you would have got two years ago 

Uh

so a twenty-five per cent increase in budget  uh will equal more than a twenty-five uh per cent increase  in actual volume of improvement delivered 

The trunk road construction programme has been doubled  and should lead to improvements to some six hundred miles of motorways  and nine hundred miles of trunk roads 

A total of a hundred and sixty bypass schemes are now under construction or are in the planning and design stages 

More much more is being spent on public transport 

Both British Rail and London Transport have increased their capital expenditure plans considerably 

Uh

British Rail 's investment for example is due to rise by some sixty per cent  uh the highest for thirty years uh to four billion pounds including a uh almost one and a half billion on upgrading links to the Channel Tunnel

And I can't incidentally think uh of a greater tribute uh to our chairman this evening than the fact that uh this as it were dividend from the many years that he put into trying to convince people of the need to invest uh in our uhm transport infrastructure has finally uh come home

and not before time

Likewise London Underground plans to invest something like two and a half billion including uh the uh extension to the Jubilee Line

So an awful lot has happened and I think uh or is planned to happen

And that 's good news 

But having said all that uh we have to recognise uh as I said that despite doing all this we will still  enter the twenty-first century with the worst transport infrastructure in Northern Europe 

Uh there is still no map  of the economic geography of our nation going into the twenty-first century

If someone says to you what do we want the transport infrastructure of this nation to look like  uh by the year twenty ten nobody can tell you 

There is no map anywhere  which is an astonishing thing to be saying  let alone from someone uh like me 

Well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen uhm 

Today we 're going to be uhm  having a quick look at some Greek temples 

And the slide th that is immediately on the screen is a  fairly ruinous view of really  some of the very best preserved of Greek temples that we actually still have even today

Uhm it 's one of those magnificent engravings

You can probably guess  some of you  uhm eighteenth century engraving by Piranesi

And it 's of two out of the three splendid temples  uhm which you can find in the south of Italy not very far south of Salerno  on the same coast as the Bay of Naples

These temples are at a place that in Greek times was called after the god Poseidon  Poseidonia  which becomes then corrupted to Paestum 

So uhm it 's a little tidier if you go there today or 

I went there last week

It 's a little bit tidier than this 

There 's still a lot of buddleia and plants at the top of these fantastic buildings 

But really almost as spectacular as you see there

These uh temples uh got abandoned after  well in fact after Medieval times though the site was still used and inhabited by Medieval people up to about the eighth century B C

And then the area which is uh festooned with little stream courses really began to be uh very dangerous indeed because of all the malaria that was uh around as the the river silted up

So people had to abandon it

It was only really with  the clearance of the area by Mussolini and the plantation of gigantic numbers of eucalyptus trees that the area became inhabitable again

And now the temples have been cleared for us to actually see them in all their glory

So they are as it happens  uh  very romantic places  uh for modern uh south Italian brides to go

They the Uhm there 's something very literally magical for them about ruins

You have to go after your wedding to be photographed in one of these places which has been around for two and a half thousand years

So this is a very common sight  on a Saturday at Paestum 

But it 's these uh splendid Doric temples there that uhm are the ones I 'd like to start with

And uh I 'll be telling you a little bit about Greek temples on my way to this as it were which most of you will recognise as an image of the Acropolis the high city of Athens  dominated by the great mid fifth century B C temple  to Athena herself

So we 'll be looking at the way that these temples are used how they were actually physically built  and prepared for what they were meant to be which was homes for the gods and goddesses 

Now to look at the Parthenon uh 

Here it is on a grey day 

Uhm today you really can't go and wander round very easily because there 's an enormous crane at work  since the whole thing had to be dismantled  uh to remove very bad repair work that 's been done over the last uh  century or so

So you can never get a view of it like this  today 

But here it is on the Acropolis before all the scaffolding went up before they started dismantling it 

And uhm it is a Doric temple

And perhaps I should begin by just explaining what these orders are

You 've all I think heard of them

Uhm Doric Ionic Corinthian is the way that they 're all conventionally quoted which sort of gives you an idea of the way that they actually developed in terms of time

Uh an American lady that I gave a lecture uhm on architecture to fairly recently said she was able to take her sons around London telling them which was Doric Ionic and Corinthian 

And she said uh it 's very easy to remember which order they come in if you actually just think simply think of their initials 

And since this is a public lecture I 'm not going to actually pronounce the initials in order but you can work it out for yourselves  

It helped her fine  

Anyway uh that was Doric

I should have said  just with Doric uhm  you will on the Greek version of Doric always get these long slender lines called flutes 

There is an Italian version of it which is quite common on Renaissance palaces  uhm which is known as Tuscan Doric and usually there are no flutes at all

But they 've got the simplest and plainest kind of capitals with a kind of supporting block at the top as it were

They 're usually all carved in one piece 

Just to show you what uhm Ionic  looks like  next in the list in uh those initials 

Ionic is uh slender  and the columns much much more slender 

Again traditional  uh Greek and Roman theorists  likened Doric to be  really a sort of slender girl whereas uh sorry Ionic to be a slender girl whereas Doric was thought of as being more robust and more male in form 

Uhm many more flutes twenty-four  flutes usually  on Ionic whereas you only get twenty-four of the stripes as it were  uhm on Doric

So  more of these lines going up the length of the columns simply make it look slender anyway by by means of a  an optical illusion 

And at the top these magnificent curled 

They 're called usually volutes

And the Latin word for those huge lengths of papyrus glued together which you have to unroll in other words a scroll  is a volumen so this gives us our word volute

You think of it as a big piece of papyrus that 's winding itself about and you 'll see then you 've got these scroll-like tops to them

So there 's a beautiful bit of Ionic from another temple on the Acropolis uh  the one called the Erechtheum 

And here is just a little  uh sample of the way that  Ionic may well have developed 

Uh it developed over on the coast of Asia Minor uhm  rather in the in the direction that Troy is so we 're talking about the uh north-west coast of of Turkey 

And as you can see the earliest versions of a type of Ionic very much a kind of vegetable-looking uh column uh capital 

There 's that

You can imagine it being made of bound vegetation 

That then developed into something we 're much more familiar with 

And this is Ionic of the sixth century B C

And you can see a version of this if you like if you 've got time to go to the architecture rooms uh after this lecture 

That 's how it had become by the sixth century B C

And then the most perfect form of Ionic by about  the fourth century B C  as a temple dedicated to Athena Praeini uh modern day Turkey

This is the prototype for the columns and capitals of the British Museum itself 

So when you leave the building look up  and you 'll see these huge  uh columns and capitals very closely modelled  on this fourth century version of Ionic  uhm on the museum itself 

So from pre-sixth century right up to fourth century B C Ionic developing  uhm over there as it were then on the coast of Asia Minor

Doric developing mainland Greece  and then in those Greek colonies uh like Paestum which had been actually set up on the territory  of Italy and Sicily 

And then the third one uhm in our trio of the main orders and their capitals 

Here we have Corinthian  which for my money always looks exactly like Chinese cabbage misbehaving itself because that 's the plant that you see most often

But in fact uhm most of us know it 's really a version of that huge robust plant the acanthus  which many of you may have in your gardens

So these are  doubled acanthus leaves  all very robust and interesting and particularly marvellous when you catch them in profile

That gives you the springing shapes like you see here 

So that 's the third then of the orders which are  traditionally the main ones used in uh both Greek and Roman architecture

But now let 's look at the origin of temples uhm  how they first got the shape they did  uh what they were used for too 

And our best bit of help for how they might 've looked and the original idea of what a temple is  is to be found in the Athens National Museum 

And this is a miniature version of a temple 

Something like the eighth century B C as far as I remember so you know a good two hundred years before anything elaborate or large built in stone 

And what you can see is it 's it 's merely a kind of flat-backed shed which has been erected  uhm the sort of thing that 's really very simple indeed to build 

Uhm some of it presumably of wood like the little columns at the front at the front 

Uh may have been on a stone base the real building as it were that this is a version of but almost certainly the walls made of  probably mud brick 

And if you 're going to have them made of mud brick and it rains remember to actually stick a ledge or cornice all the way round  so that the  mud can not actually get ruined by the rain

That 's the important thing to do

So that explains the cornice 

It also explains too uhm why you should have one of these very splendid pitched roofs of that kind

Uhm you want the water to drain off not to damage the mud brick walls

The roof is of a very steep  at a very steep angle  because  it was probably made of thatch originally

And it 's when temples then become bigger and you stop using thatch  you can actually uh reduce the angle at which the r the roof has been shaped

Once you start using terracotta tiles or even  thin marble tiles you can make the  the profile of the roof less sharp 

So we 've got here what we 'll recognise in later Greek temples

But the the area at the front here  uh where in later Greek temples pieces of sculpture will be placed that 's that 's nowhere near as useful a shape  as it would be later on 

So let 's get ourselves back to Paestum  because  an aerial view that somebody took  obviously Italy in a  very drought-ridden state 

With this commercial photograph  it gives us a very good idea of how two out of the three temples at Paestum are actually laid out in relation to the rest of the city 

Uhm lots of Roman development down here 

But in relation uh to the way they 're actually used they 're both of them set  in a space which is kept more or less free of other buildings except uh holy buildings

So in fact the far side of this temple here  and there you can just make out some  uh  stony parts which are in fact the remains of outdoor altars because you offer sacrifices sacrifices of huge animals like oxen which have just been  just been killed

These are the sort of things that are slaughtered  in honour of the gods 

And you obviously don't do that inside the building 

Uhm the building is very specifically  only the house for the god or goddess

So uhm it 's their house

You only go in there

We don't know how often in fact with most temples

You don't go in there all the time

The building is safely shut 

But it 's where they  in the form of their statue actually live as it were

So these are the houses

Those are the altars

This is the space all around which is holy where you  uh for example dig special pits to put the remains of the sacrifices in and seal them up 

And then along here there is a nicely paved route  because you and your animals  you as worshippers  uhm process along a certain route up to these temples to actually make your offerings 

And that 's a view of the nicely paved  well we call it a sacred way

This is the route normally used to approach Paestum itself with these two temples side by side 

That one is going to look  to you a little bit like the Parthenon because it 's uhm roughly the same date  uh mid fifth century B C 

This one uhm  even in this photograph you can see it 's much squatter broader  slightly smaller scale overall 

That in fact is a century earlier 

uhm it 's mid sixth century B C 

And here we actually look at it

It 's the one if you go to Paestum that they  uh still sometimes call the Basilica because people when they looked at this strange building weren't actually convinced initially it was a temple at all

They thought it was maybe  a sort of law courts building like the Romans would use

That 's what basilica means  usually in Roman terms

Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen

the talk today About Earthquakes and Buildings Shaken and Stirred

and this relates really to experiences of earthquake damage tied with the Earthquake Engineering  Investigation Team which is a British group of engineers scientists and seismologists who visit major earthquakes with the intention of observing damage and learning lessons for the future in terms of better earthquake resistance design

It was formed in eighty-two and is a joint venture between universities and industry

The team specifically consists of four to eight people roughly split between the two equally

And funding for the university side comes from research sources such as S E R C and the industrial sources for uh the industrial participants

There are eight major earthquakes listed there which have been visited four of which in the last eighteen months

I 've personally been involved in three of those

I 'm going to show some illustrations today from two quite different earthquakes the Santa Cruz earthquake in California in eighty-nine and the Australian earthquake of eighty-nine in Newcastle Australia 

The basic principles of earthquake resistant design require that buildings should be as much as possible regular and also should possess enough ductility in order to absorb the energy of the ground motions that 're imparted to them

I 'll explain what ductility is later on

But basically let 's go through those points where the regularity can be violated and thereby cause problems in terms of earthquake resistance 

First of all asymmetry is an area of concern because it leads to uh differential forces on elements in the structure such as walls and columns and leads to excessive loading on one side of the structure compared with the other

The geometry is also important for the same reason except that includes tower structures built on top of uh other buildings of different dimensions which again cause the mass not to be distributed uniformly 

There are situations where wall constraints are not continuous throughout the height of the building causing a vertical irregularity and the so-called soft storeys uhm chiefly in terms of architectural reasons in the first storey and with a building where there are requirements to enter the building which lead to weakening of those floors

garages being another example of where the first storey in particular can weaken

The ductility is present in such structures as are built in steel or reinforced concrete modern engineered structures but is often not present in brittle structures such as unreinforced brick masonry which is a typical example of the constraint in Australia 

An example of an asymmetric building showing frames and walls that are distributed non-uniformly

This is the plan view

And as a result of that distribution of walls and frames

the columns are these dots

and the the walls are here

and basically the distribution of mass and of stiffness is such that there is a separation between the two illustrated here by these vertical lines where the centres of mass of each floor and the centres of stiffness are located leading to a rotational mot motion in the building in response to ground motion and excessive forces on the cradle walls situated the furthest from the centre of stiffness 

And this is a plan view of an element suffering excessive motion on this side due to the addition of the torsion motion to the sheer motion 

Typical modes of vibration in buildings

The top shows first mode

and the bottom second mode consistent with various stiff floors such as concrete slabs and more flexible floors such as steel frames

And it 's these motions we 're designing for

And they lead to forces acting on the structural elements which are usually then distributed through the height of the building

And their origin is an inertia force a mass times acceleration effect

What we 're looking for is to design for these forces such that the vertical elements are able to withstand the load

And in the case of irregularity certain vertical elements get uh subjected to greater loads

and this makes them more vulnerable to failure causing the collapse of floors downwards one upon another

The ductility is defined as the ability of an element of a structure to go beyond its elastic range which is this initial part of the graph 

In terms of deformation it would perhaps experience a ratio of four or six times the elastic deformation

The advantage of structures which are capable of undergoing this loading behaviour is shown here

The shaded area this is the load cycle  in an element

The shaded area represents the amount of energy dissipated

And if the structure 's able to do that possibly over several cycles in a long earthquake uh and remain intact then clearly it satisfies the requirements for earthquake resistant design

Brittle structures tend to fail before they reach point B and are therefore unable to absorb the energy and can collapse 

In design therefore the forces that we 're designing a structure for and this is shown against the natural period of the structure the vibration through the fundamental mode whereby the short or stiff structure that 's to the left and the taller structure to the right the force involved in terms of actual demand would be perhaps sixty or seventy per cent of gravity

That is for a major earthquake the structure could experience loading horizontally equal to about two thirds of its own self weight 

With the ductility incorporated the design is often reduced by a factor of four to six representing that ductility ratio such that the actual forces involved are much smaller

But compensating those is the additional displacement or deformation in the structure

The dashed line shows the actual capacity and allows for uh effects that increase the inherent strength of the building above the design and safety factor 

Two earthquakes that I mentioned earlier 

The first is known colloquially as the San Francisco earthquake in fact occurred some sixty miles away and the effects in San Francisco were much less than would 've occurred with the same earthquake at a closer distance

That was a magnitude seven point one event which is regarded as uhm a very large earthquake

The largest ever recorded was about eight point five

These are on the Richter scale

The energy released though at eight point five is some one thousand times as much as the seven point one

And there 's a similar ratio between the two earthquakes we are looking at here in terms of energy released  the Richter scale being a logarithmic function 

So two quite different earthquakes

San Francisco experienced a major earthquake of magnitude eight point two in nineteen O six

And this was the first major earthquake to affect the city since then

This is showing the Bay Bridge

one of the spans of the bridge collapsed in the earthquake

Seismics in the States clearly indicate the vulnerability of California  on the western coast  whereby these are showing the earthquakes of a magnitude greater than five that occurred over thirty year period between nineteen fifty and nineteen eighty in the States

The design provisions in California therefore are much greater than anywhere else within the continent of the United States

And many of these earthquakes are caused by a rupture along a single fault San Andreas which runs through Southern California and in fact exits into the Pacific Ocean through the city of San Francisco itself 

This is the San Andreas fault

San Francisco is here on the peninsula

And this is the bay

There are populated areas all around the bay the total population being in excess of ten million

There is a mountainous area further to the south near the town of Santa Cruz

And this is where the eighty-nine earthquake occurred

The fault rupture was over this length which is about thirty miles  and the earthquake energy propagated in all directions

But primarily of interest was the effect on the San Francisco bay area up here which was between thirty and sixty miles away 

San Andreas fault is a very recognisable surface feature in California

Not all earthquakes produce surface ruptures

This one this particular one did not rupture at the surface uhm w was at about fifteen miles down

This shows the vulnerability of different parts of the fault to earthquakes as calculated on a probability basis whereby the columns indicate the percentage likelihood of an earthquake occurring in that region with the magnitude shown at the top of the column

So we 're talking magnitude earthquakes of six six point five seven closing to seven point five

Damaging earthquakes from an engineering point of view

The  earthquake occurred here

And it was predicted prior to that that there was about a thirty per cent probability of an earthquake of six point five magnitude occurring in that region over this thirty year period nineteen eighty-eight to two thousand and eighteen

In other words the earthquake at six point five is roughly a one in a hundred year earthquake which fits with the experience of San Francisco  the second major earthquake of the century 

There was a well-known seismic gap in the  region

This is the section running from north to the left in San Francisco running south along the fault and though the  area had no earthquakes recorded over a twenty-year period the big gap there which was filled with  event of eighty-nine

This can be superimposed on the top there to fill that gap

So it 's quite often possible to predict the approximate areas where earthquakes are likely to occur in that way

It was the biggest disaster in U S history natural disaster

These are some of the statistics involved in terms of human  casualties and the cost to businesses and to homes and people displaced from their homes etc

Nevertheless uh it 's been predicted that an earthquake close to San Francisco on either San Andreas fault or perhaps the Heywood fault which is runs to the eastern side of the bay could cause maybe twenty to a hundred times more damage than shown here 

This is the San Francisco peninsula

There was damage in isolated areas around the city

I 'm going to take the marina district which is here as an example where a number of older timber-framed buildings collapsed or were heavily damaged

and over here in Oakland where there was a larger ground motion uh due to some soft soil amplification effects in the sediments around the bay

In Oakland there was an asymmetric building of typical kind where in this multi-storey building there was a sheer wall a solid wall here and to the right whereas to the left there was an open framework

You can see that on the next slide involving window openings and a frame connected with relatively weak walls which are non-structural and here columns which are taller than on other storeys and therefore more vulnerable to motion on this side of the building

And there 's examples of the damage to those  columns which required the building to be closed with the possibility of demolition involved in that case

That was a telephone exchange building

Here was the Oakland Bay bridge sorry the Oakland uhm freeway which collapsed

This is part of the uncollapsed section showing it 's a double deck freeway and the weak connection here with a lack of ductility in this region where the top columns connect with the uh deck of the lower uh freeway

And at that point there was insufficient connection in the steel bars the reinforcement to protect that against the horizontal forces which went roughly across the freeway

This is a one and a half mile stretch of that freeway

And if you look closely you 'll see that it has in fact collapsed along that full length and it 's particularly the top storey which had failed 

And this is showing some of the damage where those connections had completely sheered off in a series of connecting points spaced at about thirty metre intervals and the top deck has crashed down onto the bottom

The lower deck columns were stronger and therefore in the main survived 

This was built in the nineteen fifties before even California really got going with earthquake resistant design and would certainly not have been designed that way today

But in the sense that earthquake engineering is a relatively modern subject even thirty years ago which is a long time anything prior to that even in California or Japan which is  countries from this point of view is unlikely to have any designed earthquake resistance although natural forms of structure are obviously going to be better than others

Some natural forms particularly in timber as you 'll see in the Australian case

Well  Joseph Hekekyan  uhm  who is to my mind one of the most innovative and prolific  of the  archaeologists who have been working in Egypt  in the nineteenth or pre-twentieth century  is also  paradoxically one of the least remembered 

Uh 

even today until my own interest in him  grew out of the work that we 've been doing for the  Egypt Exploration Society 's  Survey of Memphis project  even today he is almost never referred to  in the Egyptological literature  even though he was responsible for some of the most uhm conspicuous discoveries  in the history of the exploration in ancient Egypt 

Hekekyan 's childhood to summarize this briefly  was already  uh fairly exceptional for the time 

Born in eighteen O seven  into a  Roman Catholic Armenian family  uhm living in Istanbul  he was the son of a  translator or interpreter  at the Court of Mohammed Ali  in Cairo  in the eighteenth century 

On the  orders of Mohammed Ali and entirely at his own expense  uh Joseph Hekekyan was sent  at the tender age of ten  directly to England to undergo formal training  in what today I suppose we would call business administration or business studies 

Mohammed Ali at this time was keen particularly to develop in Egypt  uh the cotton and other light industries  which were already blooming in Britain 

And he was in the habit of sending promising students  uh abroad particularly to France and to Britain  uhm for training 

Hekekyan began his formal training then at Clapham Academy 

And then when his father died three years later  uh Mohammed Ali feeling responsible for him  instructed the former  Consul General uh in Egypt  uh Samuel Briggs  who by then had become a kind of agent for Mohammed Ali in Britain  to take care of the young Hekekyan 

Uhm Briggs had him sent first to Stonyhurst College for three years  and then to the Catholic School in Carshalton  where Hekekyan developed an interest in military studies 

After a brief period of studying uh mechanics  Hekekyan then spent some time travelling around the rest of Britain  and lived between Liverpool Manchester and Glasgow  uh visiting textile factories and uh other uhm uhm work places 

And  towards the end of his stay he also made a study of hydraulics  all of which were to stand him in good stead when he  first travelled to Egypt in eighteen thirty at the age of twenty-three 

By then of course he was widely versed and  uh certainly by Egyptian standards very w highly qualified  in many di disciplines 

And he was immediately given a teaching post  in the School of Engineering 

Uhm here he succeeded his relative Akim Bey  as director in eighteen thirty-four 

Uh  this is it is important to remember that this was the time when  the uh ethnic minorities of Egypt particularly the Copts  uh and Armenians and other  Christian minorities  were particularly influential and important  in  uh business of this kind and in the civil service 

Hekekyan 's scientific and administrative skills led to a series of important postings  including a seat on a number of boards of enquiry and planning into Egypt 's educational and industrial needs  and he was himself a founder member of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Egyptienne  uh later on 

In all this time however with his background and training  and it has to be said also partly by temperament  he was clearly uneasy among the Turkish Court circles of the time  even though he had married a Turkish wife  and through  an uncompromising and no doubt forthright manner  had made a number of powerful and influential enemies 

Uhm he evidently mingled very freely and spent a almost all of his leisure time  with the European professional classes resident in Egypt  particularly the English with whom of course he felt most at home  in later life for example when he and his wife uhm as a matter of uh interest  helped Lucy Duff-Gordon with her shopping expeditions in Cairo when she was staying there 

And although no portrait of him survives to my knowledge unfortunately we have a few thumbnail sketches of him from these European sources 

Lucy Duff-Gordon herself says among her letters and in her memoirs for example  uh gives a uh uhm some idea of what he looked like 

She compares his noble bearing for example to that of a Piedmontese 

And Hekekyan himself complains  uhm in a letter to a friend  that he is disliked at Court  because he says

I talk like an Englishman 

I have English mustachios  

The death  of Mohammed Ali in eighteen forty-eight however brought Hekekyan 's powerful protection  to an end 

And despite the respect he commanded among the European community at this time his career was to uhm plummet downhill  from this time onwards 

Unhappily for him it was also a time  when  uh the Turkish Court  was purging a number of the ethnic minorities from the bureaucracy  and from influential positions 

He also suffered increasingly from ophthalmia 

And when he was forced to refuse a prestigious coal mining commission in eighteen forty-eight  this was used as a pretext by Mohammed Ali 's successor Abaz Pasha  to retire him on quarter pay from all active service 

And Hekekyan from this time  turned increasingly to his own  private and academic interests  which were to include archaeology 

The  Excuse me 

the story of Hekekyan 's short but intensive archaeological career  goes back however to another eminent man  Sir Edmund Horner  a businessman and an educationalist  who was in fact as a matter of interest one of the founder members  of what was later to become  University College London 

Horner 's chief private interest however was geology

He was at this time president of the Geological Society of London  and was later to be president of the Royal Society 

And over the years Horner was to become almost obsessed with one aspect of uh geology in Egypt  after reading uh one or two short papers by Karl Lepsius the German Egyptologist 

And this was the rate at which the sediment in the uh on the floor of the Nile valley  had risen  with succeeding inundations 

It 's worth remembering at this point that the state of uh Egyptian archaeology at this time  uhm was very much as  as 

is that fairly clear at the back 

The state of Egyptian archaeology at this time was very much regarded as   Egypt was regarded as the source of individual  treasures and items  uhm which  most of which were uhm exported from Egypt  and found their way into  national and uh private collections uhm particularly in Europe uhm at the time 

And uhm   uhm the number of sites which were no doubt later to become  extremely important such as the pyramids  uh  uhm such as the uh vast temple sites at Thebes for example  and Luxor and Carnak

This is a view of Carnak  showing  particularly  here  how the  uhm level ground level had risen by the  medieval period to halfway up the temple walls 

Uh major sites like the famous uh mortuary temples of  Hatshepsut and  the First and  uh  uhm  uh Thebes  were   at Thebes  uh were still undiscovered and even unguessed at 

And even in the Cairo area  where Hekyn  Hekekyan was later to work  uhm sites such as the vast step pyramid  enclosure of  one of the  uh earliest  monumental sites in the world to be  uh executed in stone 

these were still completely unexplored 

And in particular the  what would now be a modern science of geo-archaeology such as Horner had in mind  uhm were  uhm uh almost unheard of 

Horner 's business interests in fact he was uhm uh  Scot and based largely in Glasgow  uhm kept him out of the field for  almost all his active career 

uh he did in fact spend a short time  uh  during leisure time  given over to  uhm geological fieldwork in Germany  but it 's an extraordinary thing that in all the work that was later to be done in Egypt  he never visited  the country and in fact he was never to have met Hekekyan at all 

Hekekyan came to Horner 's attention  through the good offices of A C Harris  who was at about that time  effectively the British Consul General  in Alexandria  uh who recommended Hekekyan to carry out the fieldwork for Horner  who as I say was  unable to  uh visit the country 

And Hekekyan  during the next uh few years from eighteen fifty-one to eighteen fifty-four  then carried out a series of field projects in Egypt  uhm largely  using the technique of drill drilling or taking cores  uhm through the Nile alluvium  uh in order to  uh  record some of the  uh geology to in particular to gauge the depth of the alluvial deposit 

The first site that Hekekyan chose  uhm on the instructions of uh Horner  was the site of Heliopolis 

this was in eighteen fifty-one 

Heliopolis today is effectively a suburb a north-eastern suburb of Cairo  uh and is as you can see perhaps from this slide  remarkably industrial wasteland  apart from the archaeological sites the green area  and the cultivation which represents the main temple of the ancient city 

And uh you can just see over on the right here  the standing obelisk a standing obelisk of  uhm Sosostris the first of the early Twelfth Dynasty 

Uh

Horner chose this site because he  felt reasonably confident that a standing obelisk of this kind  would provide a kind of yardstick a correlation uh against which to judge the rate at which the  uh Nile alluvium had risen  uhm subsequently 

Uh

this is of course we know now a a rather simplistic kind of view  of how  his uh ends might have been achieved  because there are all sorts of complicating factors like the collapse of  walls uh as well as the fact that the obelisk itself was almost certainly not in its original  twelfth dynasty  uhm location 

And although this was to have a number of unfortunate effects such as the uhm wild misdating of uh some of the  uh artifacts that were found uhm the  principle as it were seems reasonable enough 

And among uh Hekekyan 's papers  which were all collected in the  or mostly collected in the  British Library in London  uhm are a number of volumes which uh show fairly lavish uh pen and colour-wash maps and views of the work that was done 

Here we 're looking at the site of Heliopolis in Hekekyan 's day in eighteen fifty-one  uh where as you can see  it was still surrounded by the fields 

Uh here 's the  uh extent of the site itself  with the obelisk  in the middle here 

And Hekekyan as I say uh produced a number of mineral cores in and around the site  uhm

but  Egyptian archaeological sites being what they are almost everywhere where Hekekyan uhm put in a drill he came across some stone uh object or monument  and was obliged or at least felt obliged  to open the excavation up  into uhm a uh major uh area excavation  finding a number of very important monuments  uh in the process 

In fact he had  uh six major s uh uhm excavations within the  uhm precinct of the city itself  including just to the south of the uh obelisk

Here again is the view  of the obelisk rather more closer up 

It was actually located in a uh garden  and open to tourists 

There it is

In Hekekyan 's day the uh office was in fact located in a royal uhm villa estate  uh

and this perhaps is one of the reasons why he worked there for such a short period of time certainly no more than three or four months  uhm because partly because the  uh uh uh  all the small findings that he uh came up with  were immediately claimed by Abaz Pasha for his own  uhm private collections 

Uh one thing that Hekekyan found which was of particular interest  was a uhm pedestal base of the corresponding obelisk to the site  which would have

the two would have stood either side of the main axial approach into the main temple at Heliopolis 

And  when I first came to Heliopolis to  uhm check the uhm uh results of Hekekyan 's  uhm  measurements and excavations  I was quite startled I must say to find that this  pedestal is still in situ 

I don't  believe  quite honestly that  Hekekyan 's excavation has remained  uhm uh vacant to this day 

but it 's clearly been re-excavated in more recent times 

Uh  all of Hekekyan 's work was centred in the Cairo area which you see on this  false colour satellite image  uhm 

This is the southern part of the Nile delta here  and the northern part of the Nile valley  with the final progression that 's showing in the south uhm in the uh bottom left corner  and the major conurbation Cairo as it is today  as the fulcrum between the  uh delta and the valley

And uh the site of Heliopolis as I say is  uh just here at the east of southern Cairo 

In eighteen fifty-two having decided that further work at Heliopolis would be  uhm uh relatively fruitless  Hekekyan moved to Memphis which is  a little way south of Cairo about twenty-five kilometres south  of the main city 

This is Humphrey Davy who you may have heard of in connection with nitrous oxide which he invented

Laughing gas you know at the dentist 's

And he ran away  before he was due to give a lecture at the Royal Institution and as a result people are still locked up speakers are still locked up for ten minutes  before the lecture starts today

And nit uhm Humphrey Davy 's nitrous oxide gave me my start  because uhm many years ago  uhm we worked on memory as improved by a period under nitrous oxide

And what happened was that uhm  human subjects were taught  a list of syllables over several trials till they then knew quite a lot  uh had them correct

And then they had an interval of fifteen  thirty-five minutes  during which either they learnt another list of syllables or named colours 

If during this interval they breathed ordinary air they forgot about 

well it was over a third  if they had been learning syllables learning something similar

If they were learning  something different if if they were naming colours they forgot less but they still forgot 

If on the other hand they breathed nitrous oxide it makes them sleepy  they remembered better 

And this shows that a period of rest after learning can be beneficial 

And uhm  I talked about this at the uhm British Association  and this was seized upon by somebody called Chapman Pincher who still may be familiar to you today 

And what he said was that alcohol was good for the memory 

Well a few drops helped you remember 



Now uhm this for some reason went all over the world 

and uhm I found it in the front pages of Figaro

and I found it in the  uh the Sunday Times in New York

And various people rang me up and I made some very interesting friends from South Africa who became collaborators 

So though at the time I thought I 'd never live it down  in fact it had a very useful spin-off 

Uhm my main work as many of you will know has been with drugs 

And in nineteen fifty-seven  uhm

no

this was in nineteen sixty-seven

the  previous one was in fifty-seven

this was in sixty-seven 

uhm 

Pi which is still going as the college paper published something on my work and called me Psychadelphia

I never discovered why

But anyway that 's what  they chose to call it

And this was at the time when purple hearts became famous

Now you may remember purple hearts those of you who are old enough  which were uhm  Drinamyl tablets which consisted of  a stimulant-antidepressant  mix  and they were called purple hearts because they were sort of mau uh mauve heart-shaped and that is a sixpence to show they were that small 

And Britain 's teenagers discovered that they gave very good effects  better than the separate  drugs 

And these mixtures were then used so much by the teenagers often mixed with alcohol that the whole purple hearts wave  became a kind of social problem 

and in the end the things were first  uhm made round by the makers 

and then they were proscribed altogether

and now you can't buy these mixtures any more

But where I came in was that my colleagues and I mixed these drugs experimentally because we found there was no literature and no evidence as to why they should work 

And we found in fact that they did give better effects both on accuracy of performance and on mood than the separate drugs alone 

And drug combination has been one of the fields in which I still work today and which has turned out extremely f fruitful 

Uhm

Now the next one 

Uhm now drugs  may not appear to be involved in aerobics 

but those of you who have studied uhm some of the theories about of why physical exercise does you mentally good may have come across endorphins which are morphine-like substances which we make ourselves in times of stress or exertion or injury  and which are our natural home-made opiates 

Uhm  there was in  the well in the early eighties I think there was a big interest in physical fitness

and aerobics became a sort of by-word

And this is the 

Uhm 

Sorry how do I focus it better 

Do I do the middle thing 

 

Ah that 's it

Sorry

Oh that 's much better

Uhm  aerobics which covered a multitude of exercise of all kinds  became very fashionable

And people thought that it made for physical fitness

And that of course it can do

What was less explained was that it also made for mental  fitness if you like feelings of  uhm wellbeing feelings of happiness feelings of being unstressed and able to cope 

And this was viewed with considerable suspicion  till a number of people came along and actually measured  by means of questionnaires and other methods  the  changes in people 's mood and performance before and after various kinds of exercise 

And this

Uhm I gave a lunch hour lecture about this  uhm 

And it caught uhm the eye of  uhm Name of the Ham and High

At least I think that 's how he got on to me I don't know how  he did otherwise  and uhm  interviewed me at a time that I had toothache and various other misfortunes

The photograph I thought was absolutely terrible

But the article was extremely good

And you may have seen uhm  how it highlighted  two things 

One of these is  the link between  exercise making you feel good and aerobics here and endorphins

sorry here  and also here a picture that says picture shows the professor herself engaged in some form of dance 

Now this has haunted me ever since uhm because it 's while it 's humorous  uhm  I have to admit that I have done it for a very long time

But what hasn't happened till recently is that I 've discovered and I 'd be very grateful for volunteers on this

I never get any but I uhm keep trying 

I 've discovered that if I dance in the right way the right mood and the right circumstances  it seems to tap what everybody calls the stream of consciousness

I begin to have thoughts and ideas that I didn't have before but I 'm looking for

Say if I 'm stuck when I 'm writing something  and I start my special dance which I won't demonstrate uhm  I actually get ideas  which I thought had escaped me

And I was pleased to s read this Sunday in the Sunday Times Magazine that Paddy Ashdown gets his best ideas while doing aerobics so maybe he 'll volunteer 

It 's particularly hard to get men to volunteer for anything like this because it 's  somehow not  considered man-like to indulge in this sort of activity 

So anybody who 's interested in either  doing this and letting me know whether they succeed in tapping their stream of consciousness by dancing or any other exercise  is very warmly invited to write to me and send me a little report anonymously if they prefer 

Now this one was  again carried out with a group of colleagues here  which showed that if you deprive people who are used to this exercise from their customary exercise for even a fortnight they will have what might be called withdrawal symptoms

And in this case they the deprived group  uhm

well these are this is the normal score  and it 's very close on anxiety and insomnia which are bad things

Uhm when they 're deprived of exercise for two weeks  the deprived group has many more symptoms of anxiety and insomnia

With uhm the exercise reinstated there is recovery

And in fact the deprived group does somewhat better than the controls who are not deprived 

And this links again both with exercise ad addiction which I mentioned at the beginning and with endorphins because one feels that if you create too many if you secrete too many of your own endorphins  you get addicted to your own  home-made opiates and then have to keep producing them

And in fact people who are addicted to exercise seem to be in a very strange state

Have you ever ever seen anybody who was addicted to exercise

Well not unless you see them doing it because there 're some who actually exercise continuously and their social life goes to pieces

their family life goes to pieces

and they simply do dancing or trampoline dancing or aerobics or whatever form it takes

They very often do it alone

But they can also do it in company with others in the centre

And the centre the exercise centre becomes apparently  also the centre of their life

and all the rest is ancillary to going there and doing the exercises for as hard as they can as often as they can 

Some of them get very thin

And you may have heard about the connection between anorexia  and exercise which is an interesting one and it needs to be explored more

Anyway that 's the sort of thing that links it that you get withdrawal signs if you 're used to exercise and stop

And that links with both the other kinds of addiction and the idea of endorphins being addictive 

certainly some substances 

By the way if there 's anything up here please interrupt me because  

Now this one was also on uhm exercise

And that appeared in The Times 

And the  there was no photograph of me uh uh uhm

They took two rolls  and uhm

Sorry 

They took two rolls of me dancing in the cloisters which much against my better judgement

I let myself be photographed  in a cape dancing in the cloisters

And uhm they   uhm used this which was far nicer and also much more sort of suitable

But one of the things I 'd like to uh  draw your attention to  is that better is here where  uhm I refer to an idea which has been around for some time and seems to me entirely obvious  but which has not been followed up

And that is this

That if you have opiate addicts who are being treated  for uhm cure if you like who are on uhm  a programme of detoxification as it 's normally called  then they 're very often given substitute drugs which are sort of weaker opiates like methadone to keep them going and prevent them from having too bad withdrawal symptoms and lapsing into addiction

Now it seemed to several of us that  if you can exercise these people so that they create their own endorphins their own opiate-like substances this might substitute  for the opiates that they miss

They would no longer need to be given  weaker  maintenance drugs and might actually stop relapsing and might actually get better  without intervention of other drugs 

And uhm  I in particular was very keen on this idea and I tried very hard to persuade a clinic  to take it on and found various other people who were willing to help 

But it didn't work

Now by publishing this though here and also in a book review  various people did get in touch with me who had done informal trials with addicts in clinics and had found that if they gave strenuous and regular exercise regimes  the addicts did get better and did not relapse

And so there 's here a big field of research for somebody  who uhm is keen on a sort of social and non-invasive  method of treating  uhm  quite serious uhm opiate and other addicts

It 's also said to work with alcoholics so it 's it 's all there for people to pick up 

Now this is me actually dancing  

And finally uhm  I 've been involved with something very surprising to me which some of you may know about

And that is uhm  Doctor Elizabeth Sykes and I  won in the High Court a decision which is important planning law which roughly said that any new development in a conservation area  should preserve or enhance the area

it should not just not harm it

In other words a new development should follow a positive  enhancement policy not merely a neutral or negative one of not harming

Now that was in the Town and Country Planning Act but it had never been challenged in the courts

And with help from Professor Grant and various other people in college also we took  this case because it involved us directly because our house as I said was being made semi-detached  uh to another cottage 

Uh we took this to the High Court and won

It was a very terrifying experience

We hardly told anybody because it was so dreadful

And again everything went wrong

Murphy 's Law had a field day  because ev all the meetings were put forward

we were never ordered what to do

we had no idea of how things were going where to sit or anything 

and in the end we were litigants in person

and I had to stand up in what has become known as my  Jaeger litigation costume

 uhm  

it was hung up in one of the fitting rooms when I brought it because uhm I had a very good friend there and she was there too 

It 's a very old one I may say

Uhm and through this which was done on the spur of the moment

and we didn't have time to be nervous when they took this photograph because somebody just appeared after the court hearing

and we were still recovering and had to work out what had happened 

Uhm through this which appeared on the back page of The Telegraph uhm  on the Saturday  uhm it got all over the country very fast

And I was very surprised  that so many of my friends seemed to read The Telegraph till I was told it had a very good crossword puzzle

and that was on the back page on a Saturday

So that 's how it got around so much 

Uhm 

There have been many other references to this case

And it 's an example of how something totally unexpected may result from media coverage because  we 've helped by this without our realising it people all over England  and to preserve and enhance their areas or their houses or their  little villages or whatever

We 've had a huge mail bag which we actually can't hope to deal with 

We ourselves are having problems again at the moment because something else has threatened to be built next us

But whatever happens the principle that was established by this court case has made a huge difference

And somebody reported to me that uhm they 'd talked to the people at the Department of the Environment because we won this case against Mr Ridley that uhm our names were now engraved  on the hearts of the D O E like name 

And I 'm afraid my ancient history was so bad that I had to have this explained to me

But I 'm glad it has made an impact 

OK uh  well my name 's Wyndham Johnstone 

I too work in the Physics department  and as you can see  the title of my talk I 'm going to talk about  experimental collisions  with uh molecules of electrons with molecules 

Uh I want to split the talk up into three parts 

First I 'll talk  little bit about  why it 's important to study  electron collisions with molecules 

Second I 'll discuss  a few of the aspects that can happen when  electrons actually collide with the molecules 

And third I 'll go on to discuss uh  and show some of my results 

So 

OK  here 's just a  few of the areas where  collisions of electrons with molecules play an important role 

Uhm  as you can see the first four areas  have a general  industrial  practical application 

And probably the areas that most people are familiar with are  lasers and planetary atmospheres 

Uhm  for example in the C O Two laser  it 's uh collision of electrons with uh  molecules in the laser  which cause them to be excited  and hence emit lader ra laser radiation 

Also in planetary atmospheres  it 's uh  oxygen molecules in the upper atmosphere  which are in collision with electrons  which are  also excited and then give out light which we know as the Northern Lights 

Uhm  to obtain better understanding of the f  these first four areas it 's possible to build  models  which  give a better understanding of the physical processes involved 

And if these models are to be useful we need a comprehensive set  of uh  electron  scattering information from molecules 

Uhm  the last area I 've listed is  fundamental interest 

This is  basically investigating  uh the basic interaction of an electron with a molecule 

Uhm  you can gain this information by experiment and also by uh  by theory 

Uh

because of the complicated nat nature of the electron-molecule interaction  very difficult to model f  theoretically 

and therefore theorists need a  a good set of experimental data  as a benchmark for their calculations 

Right 

Oops 

Lost the transparency 

Ah ha  disaster 

Now what I was going to show you next was going to be a transparency  which I 've  now lost 

OK on on the transparency I was going to show you basic uh  collision of an electron with a molecule 

Electron comes in  hits a molecule  A B  scatters off at an angle V 

OK 

Now there 's a number of possibilities  of of what can happen 

First of all the electron has hit the molecule and bounced off  losing no energy at all  and that 's called elastic scattering 

Second  electron can come in  hit the molecule  and excite the molecule 

Uh this can take the form of making the molecule r rotate  or vibrate 

And much like a tuning fork  it will only do this at certain precise frequencies  so therefore  the molecule will only absorb a precise amount of energy 

Third possibility is that the electron can come in  and break the molecule up 

As this requires energy to break  the two atoms apart from the molecule 

this always ho results in the elec instant electron losing energy 

The final possibility is the electron can come in  and actually knock off an electron  which is bound to one of the atoms in the molecule  and so you get two electrons  coming away from the molecule 

OK 

Well my basic  area of interest has been in the first of those possibilities which is elastic scattering 

And to do that I 've  used a  piece of apparatus called an electron spectrometer  which  uh fires a beam of electrons at a  molecular gas beam  and then  analyses  the number of electrons scattered off at a particular angle of theta  and also  how much energy they have 

Right 

So h  here are such the few results  I 've taken  in my work 

Both these graphs show  electron scattering  elastic scattering of electrons from two molecules  water  H two O  and sulphur hexafluoride  S F six 

Uh they both show  the scattered intensity  as a function of scatter angle 

And as you can see they look  quite different 

On the water On the water graph here  the uhm  you 'll see that the scattering probability is quite high for small scatter angles  and then falls  to approximate minimum of about a hundred and twenty degrees 

Whereas for the S F six  there 's two minima one at about  sixty and the other one about a hundred and twenty 

But there 's also a m  a maxima  at about eighty degrees 

And the consequences of this is that  for electrons moving through water  uh  most of them will suffer small angle  collisions  and therefore  will move through the water much more easily than the S F six  and because of the large  poss probability of having a  a large angle collision they will be  forced off in all sorts of directions  and generally move through the S F six much slower 

Uhm  also on the water data I 've shown  some theoretical calculations  as well 

Uh as you can see the 

Uh my name 's Mark Abbott and I 'd like to give you a brief runthrough of electronic mail  or e-mail as it 's more fe commonly known 

Uhm

I 'd like to explain exactly  well briefly what it is  and what it can do for you  and more importantly  uh how you can actually use it  uhm to ab enable you to send messages and so on 

Electronic mail  as its name might suggest is a  computer-based  uhm messaging system 

Uhm it 's ideal for text messages because most computers can only handle text messages 

Uhm 

the  main benefit of it in terms of  o that over other messaging systems is that there 're a large number of users across the globe  who use e-mail and read it regularly  which means there 's a very efficient way of communicating with them 

Other than being efficient it 's also a very easy method of communicating with them because once you 've typed your message  you can just send it e away onto the messaging system 

and it 'll be taken care of and delivered at the other end 

Now this makes it for uh a very very simple and easy way of  uh having communications with other people 

Now as for the  actual usage of e-mail  other than the  uhm  why you might want to use it  sending messages is  very simply a case of  deciding what you want to send  and then to whom you want to send it  and sending it 

Uhm it 's there 's one command you have to u use to send messages 

It 's as easy as that 

And to know uh knowing of  who you want to send these to very simple as well 

you just  have to know their address 

and addresses are in a very simple format  a and a very common format used throughout the world 

As to what you might want to send  for an e-mail message well  more commonly it 'd be  short notes or memos or of that order 

Uhm there 's also the possibility you could say work on  uh collaborative documents  and so  you want to exchange your latest version of it with somebody 

Uhm 

or  uh more esoterically you might have some data you want to send to somebody  uh if you 're  collaborating on experiments 

uhm 

and instead of having to exchange large data tapes you can  just turn it into text and send it over  e-mail links 

Because you can rely on the delivery  committed in the way it goes 

Uhm  and so it 's very simple to use  uhm in terms of sending messages 

Once you 've sent a message onto the e-mail system  receiving them  is as simple as sending them 

You get automatic delivery 

and you 'll normally get told  when a message is available for you 

uhm 

and it  tells you who it 's from  uhm and other thing information 

Replying  to a message is even easier than sending 

You just tell it to  reply  and the  destination  of your reply is taken out of the  message you 're replying to

It 's all automatic

you don't have to know anything else about  how it arrived or anything 

You just again need one command to reply  uhm 

Having  got over this uh  read your message  you then  have to decide exactly what you want to do with it now 

All the messages are automatically saved  because  on the computer  and then they 're stored on disk 

If you decide it 's junk mail  and you do get it  you very simply dispose of it 

Uhm  again like all these things it 's designed for one command

That 's all you need to know 

uhm

and  you just say  get

go

and it disappears 

and that 's the end of your message 

Now  as for actually  how  or to whom you send the messages  there 's a standard convention  used  for addresses for e-mail 

Uhm 

it 's composed of  somebody 's initial  their first initial  their surname  and  if it 's somewhere other than where you are now  a location 

Uhm 

so for instance Fred Bloggs 's address is shown there  in three situations  one within the department he 's in  which I 've assumed here is Electronic Engineering 

the second one is  within  from within U C L where  you can say 

OK 

uhm 

this is Electronic Engineering at U C L 

That 's all you need to do 

The final one is one you can use from anywhere else in the world  uhm 

And that specifies the country  the type of location  and all the other bits and pieces we 've mentioned so far 

So I mean  to actually find  somebody 's address all you need to know is their name 

and obviously you 'd know their name  because you  probably know to whom you 're talking 

A final thing  is  obviously with addresses like that  you have a problem of if they 're very long or you 've got several people to  send messages to you can get a lot of typing 

What you can do is you can create shorthand  uhm addresses called  aliases 

Uhm

these are just whatever you want it to be 

uhm 

some days you want you know somebody who 's Fred Bloggs

you just type Fred  and that 'll get transcribed into his full address 

Uhm  by combining several like this you can make a distribution list  which is very handy if you want to target mail at certain groups of people for instance postgraduates or staff 

Or say you 're having an ongoing conference with people you 're working with or just friends 

uh

you can  bi combine those into a list and use that for sending mail 

Uhm  now there are always two types of these things

One is common 

for instance I already mentioned postgraduates  uhm or those that are private the ones where you may  uhm as I 've said having ongoing conversations with people 

and you just want to use that for your own purposes 

Uhm  I hope I 've shown that  electronic mail  is a  very simple to use system 

it enables you to  send simple text messages to people  uhm across the world  uhm  at very  little penality to actually what you have to know  uhm with a computer 

Thank you 

 this evening to  introduce  Professor Peter Cook to give his inaugural  lecture  on the subject of the ark 

Peter graduated at the A A in nineteen sixty 

and he taught there  for several years

but since then he 's done  so many things  uh both as a practitioner  as a writer as a teacher  that if I really went through his C V embracing all of his activities not just in the U K but throughout Europe and Japan  and so on  I guess I 'd be going on  nearly as long as the two hours that is promised us this evening  anyway 

And so I 'm going to cut all of that  because I guess most people  in the room already know Peter Cook extremely well 

And all I will simply do is quote  from one of the totally independent referees not a referee of your choice  that uh commented when we were seeking guidance  on this appointment 

And he said I can well believe that you 've gone through an exhaustive search  because you 've made a choice of candidate which I think is brilliant 

Peter Cook is intellectually one of the most powerful architects in the country 

Most important for an academic he is articulate 

and not only is he distinguished because of this 

but he is well known as a brilliant teacher 

Well I 'm sure we 're going to see that illustrated this evening 

Peter Cook 

Uhm first of all I I work in the Oncology Department with particular interest in lung cancer 

Uhm I thought I 'd run through today one of the pu uhm trials we 're currently running

Just as a bit of background information  uhm cancer of the lung kills about thirty-five thousand people uh a year in England and Wales

It 's the commonest cancer in men and is second commonest in in women

The four main  histological types of uh  lung cancer uhm squamous  and large tend to be grouped together as non-small cell

And small cell accounts for about twenty-five per cent of the incidence

It 's small cell tumours that I 'll be talking talking about in this presentation

They are the fastest growing tumours with a doubling time of only thirty-three days

Uhm  because of this rapid rate they tend to be uhm  fairly advanced on presentation and are rarely suitable for surgery

Uhm  it also means that they tend to be more more sensitive to uh chemotherapy and radiotherapy 

Uhm  chemotherapy would be the treatment of choice in these patients

uhm and  limited disease patients that 's patients that uhm  have only uh disease confined to one hemithorax on presentation uhm do very well with chemotherapy and cure is is potentially uh possible 

Dose intensity tends to be the direction of studies for for such patients

However the patients with more disseminated disease uhm  and poor prognostic features  uhm are rarely curable uhm and it 's those patients that that I 'll be talking about in this study

Uhm  we can get some good symptom relief and prolongation of life with these patients 

The study itself then  is called Poor Prognosis Patients with Small Cell Lung Cancer

And the patients have either managed to receive either three weekly  uh chemotherapy or ten eleven day which is the same uhm drugs at half the dose twice as frequently

Just to show you the timing of these treatments to summarize the timing

Platinum leutopocide alternate with cyclophosphamide and adriamycin and  on a three weekly basis for half the patients and every ten or eleven days with the other half

The drugs are exactly half  the dose on the ten or eleven day regime compared to the three weekly

The hope is that the  uhm lower doses will cause less toxicity  uh in these patients who have a poor prognosis anyway uhm and also that the number of hospital admissions will be reduced

Although they have to come up to the hospital twice as frequently the smaller doses can be given on an out-patient basis so they don't actually have to stay in hospital 

Because uhm these patients have such a short life span uhm we 're not only looking at at survival response rates and toxicity data as we would do with all other studies

we 're also interested in how the patients uh find the treatment uhm  and how much it affects their quality of life

So we we 've been asking patients to complete uhm diary cards on a daily basis uh assessing them lese uh levels of nausea vomiting pain appetite general wellbeing  sleep happiness and activity using a four category scale

This is what the diary cards look like

And the patient merely works down a column each day answering each question with an appropriate number

It 's a v fairly simple uhm tool for them to use and compliance tends to be pretty good 

Just to sort of emphasise the reason  why quality of life is so important in this study

small cell l lung cancer patients with extensive disease have a median survival if untreated of about one and a half months

With the best c current chemotherapies we can extend that to nine to twelve months median survival but uhm  obviously uh  quality of life for that extended period is extremely important

Thank you

Uhm uh  testing integrated circuits

I 've taken down this short talk from  the introduction I do to one of my  third-year undergraduate lectures 

Uh integrated circuit te testing is something we teach 

We teach people to de design integrated circuits  but a a reasonable question is what 's so difficult about it 

People tend to focus on the desi design  of a circuit  and the testing is rather  a downstream activity that may be forgotten 

But what is so difficult

Can't you just  plug an integrated circuit into a board  turn on the power and see if it works 

The answer  is definitively no

They are very very complex  things integrated circuits

We have tens  hundreds of thousands perhaps millions of transistors in an integrated circuit 

and to cut a long story short basically in order to test something thoroughly  you need to access every single one and check that it works 

Second thing is that each transistor itself is a very complex thing  got complex structure with many failure modes and some of these failure modes are are quite subtle 

So it 's not at all clear whether individual transistors work sometimes

So it 's a complex interesting uh and difficult task 

Now to emphasise the difficulty  of testing a circuit 

The whole thing is actually made that much more difficult by the high integrity  that 's needed for an individual circuit  so it 's a short amount of mathematics  some probabilities

If we define P R C as the probability that an individual circuit once tested  is really OK  and the probability P B as that of a circuit board containing N of these chips  and the probability that that circuit board is going to work OK then these two parameters are related by P B as P I C raised to the power of the number of chips 

So for example  if we are ninety-nine per cent certain once we 've applied our testing procedures to a chip that it works OK  and we use such chips  it means a hundred such chips in an individual board then you find that you 're only thirty-seven per cent sure that the board will work

In order to raise this probability  to ninety-nine per cent we require that the probability that our test procedure was correct has got to be ninety-nine point nine perc nine nine per cent 

But if you cannot thoroughly test the chip therefore  the chip may as well not have worked in the first place

So it 's a  very stringent requirement 

So it 's difficult 

The  need to get the testing right is also quite urgent  because of this problem 

We 're circuit designers 

We 're going to pass on our work down to a whole stream of people who will use the product of our work

We 'll pass the circuit down to a layout technician who will produce some information that allows an integrated circuit foundry to make the chip

This will then be packaged put into the little containers you see them in

They will then be passed on to another company that will make them into some sort of product and finally go to an end customer  something like NASA or whoever

But at every stage if an error is found in the final produced item the product the cost of backtracking tends to increase by an order of magnitude for every stage down here that we go 

So it 's important that every time a product leaves one of these stages that it works properly and this means that testing has got to be right and thorough 

Now the thing i is everybody downstream here depends on this man  to have a tractable job in testing 

If this person who designs the integrated circuit has not considered the problems of everybody else downstream the circuit will not be testable

It will be He will design a complex system that the people who inherit his work cannot test 

So what we try and teach our  our students when we teach them integrated circuit design  is simply this this 

You are designing a complex system 

It 's absolutely  vital that as an integrated circuit designer you consider the needs of the people that are going to use your circuits and test them at an early stage

You must design circuits that are testable 

That 's the message

OK

I 'm going to give you five minutes uh in which I 'm going to try and and ad lib a discussion of what we do in our department and possibly at the end of it a little bit of what I do 

So the first thing I 'm going to do I 'm going to start off uh  with some pictures 

This is what uh we would call a picture  or you would call a picture 

and it 's actually  eventually it will be 

Oh no it won't 

OK

Thanks 

Uhm  

Don't turn around with a microphone on 

Uh this is a  picture representation  uhm  sorry if it 's not particularly clear  of something which we no longer call a picture

We call it an image 

This is a mountain  in Wyoming 

I hope you can see it 

It runs down here 

It 's uhm  a false colour composite image which means that the colours in that image do not reflect anything about what you or I would see if we went onto the ground 

It 's a typical satellite remote sensed image 

It has  a great deal of information in it although perhaps you can't see that much  just by looking at it 

It 's It covers only a very small area

This is p seven by seven kilometres 

And it 's the sort of inform sort of image you might want to use t to for example find oil 

Finding oil from this image automatically  indeed using very skilled manual interpreters is not a straightforward affair 

Uh we reconvert it into the form of a picture  to look at it because we are human beings 

What it actually consists of as far as the computer is concerned  is a large number of digital images 

I don't have time really to explain what those are  

Ooh 

Think I have a slide feed problem 

Here let 's try the next one 

No

That 's not going through is it 

Right  I will talk instead 

Uh this is going to be rather abstract because you haven't seen the images that go with it

But  you can extract  elevation information about the mountain 

You saw a mountain there and it lies in a plain 

And  the topographic information  uh is very significant when you come to try and interpret the data 

You can extract that using a computer  if you simulate the way in which uh all  uh  stereo-viewing creatures  uh extract depth information 

Some satellites for example the satellite known by its acronym as SPOT  can view the same place from two directions 

This is the basis of stereo 

If you can correlate between features  uh in those two images  and have information about the way the two images were formed  you can convert that information into  into three-dimensional information about the surface structure in other words  topography or height information the same sort of thing you get from contours on a map 

This schematic shows the system that we use  to convert  uh  the images that you get from the sensor  into images  that  uhm  are corrected for the effects of of height  on uh pixel rotation 

Now I 'm going to cut again  and just very quickly explain to you  how we do stereo image correlation 

If you imagine your mountain ridge like this  uh situated on the ground in some place  you can view this from two different directions 

and you end up with a pair of images  which look very similar  to the eye  but actually contain  displacements and distortions of the same feature on the ground 

Let 's take this point on the top of a ridge 

It may appear  two different places  in this pair of images 

You know where your satellite was  no one can really agree how to draw satellites  on pieces of paper  when it took the two images 

We 'll call this the left and the right pair 

Uh you know where the two uh  satellite pos viewing positions were relative to one another

and this becomes a simple base to height  calculation  although b and h probably look quite similar from there in my handwriting  uhm of the  location of this individual feature 

Uh this might be perhaps a better example to uh see on a schematic would be a road junction  or the joining of two rivers 

You can do this for every single feature that you can extract from the images  and then end up with a very dense set of correlated points 

And when you pull them together you produce three dimensional information 

I 'm going to attempt to  uh pick up on a number of Firth 's quotes

There 's a handout uh at the at the top

You may have them 

Uhm  the title of the talk as you 'll see on the handout  is  Renewing the Connection a phrase of Firth 's

What I want to do is I want to talk about some of the work in prosodic phonology that we 're doing at York

It 's only a fragment of it  uhm

And I want to suggest that there are interesting ways of renewing the connection 

And that is uhm by doing speech synthesis 

The work I 'm going to describe this morning uh is the outcome of a large amount of work on prosodic phonology and prosodic analysis carried out over a period of time by myself my colleague John Kelly our students John Coleman  uh Adrian Simpson Bill Wells and uh one of my research colleagues  Richard Ogden 

There 've been a number of rather silly comments in the literature from time to time on the un-do-ableness of uh prosodic phonology

Uhm

the book that Professor Palmer uh  alluded to Langendoon uh Langendoon 's Tract uhm is an astonishing uh failure A to get to grips with prosodic phonology uhm  and B to see beyond the end of his nose 

Uhm

sadly uh a linguist of a far greater eminence than Langendoon Chomsky uhm also failed as you 'll notice on one of the quotes on the handout uh to find anything in prosodic enology  prosodic phonology which would uh deem it to be reputable 

There 've also been comments floating around that uhm it 's intractable you can't do it you make it up as you go along it 's the kind of theory that you knit uhm

I want to suggest that that 's simply rubbish 

I want to suggest that in the kind of work we 're trying to do at York we have actually got an explicit formalised computationally tractable version of Firth 's prosodic phonology which works

Firth is alive and well 

Uhm

in order to contextualise what I want to say I just want to play you a little bit of data 

You will have noticed this isn't a synthesizer this is a human being 

Uhm this is in fact a four-year-old  uhm who uh this is a snatch out of a recording of a four-year-old my daughter

Uhm my son at the time was having words elicited from him by me 

Uhm and she started imitating what he was doing 

Uhm these are uh the words here uhm

She in fact doesn't know bought

She says buyed uhm

She 's got no idea what a bet is 

Uhm but you will notice that she does the phonetics of these objects really rather well 

Uhm they 're glued together like perfectly appropriate bits of Eo words of English

Uh

the next two words were also words that I was eliciting from James uhm as part of uh some data that I was collecting uh to present uh in a lecture 

One thing that I want you to note is  that Firth alluded to all the time in fact  Sounds and Prosodies

And that is the prosodic effect if you like of the liquids in these words

That is you can hear that the vocalic bits in these words sound quite different the initial fricatives in these words sound quite different uhm

in articulatory terms the secondary articulatory resonance of the liquids in these two words is quite different

This child Claire has no idea what a sprit is 

Don't know whether many of us have really an idea what a sprit is

But you will hear that she does the phonetics of these perfectly appropriately 

Yeah

Now  let 's by comparison uhm get ourselves a phonemic synthesizer 

This is the world 's best  uh  phonemic synthesizer

it 's called Dektalk

It 's going to say some of these words for us 

Well it 's not bad but the glue 's a bit of a mess isn't it 

Listen to the final consonants

See if they go with the vowels 

OK let 's uh

let 's just listen to it a bit further see if it gets better as if you were to  like this 

Ugh 

Well it obviously doesn't know about resonance does it   

Uhm 

not much of a kind of prosodic integration or whatever there in sight

Let 's just see what happens if we try to uhm give it Firthian

Uhm this is the output of the uh device that I 'm going to talk about 

Uhm 

the quality of some of this isn't wonderful

but I think you will detect that there is significantly better things going on than in the other material we 've been listening to 

Just to get on  let 's just play something for  contrast

Let 's just listen to some dissyllables firstly produced by the  segmental synthesizer  uhm if this machine is going to play for us 

If I don't manage to break the machine 

Yes 

Reflect on the rhythm 

OK

Let 's hear a prosodic bash at this 

Maybe I should just go now  

Quote from Firth uhm

This Fir This quote has been uh alluded to earlier on uhm uh

plus &ccedille;a change





Uhm  Firth 's response to this position as we heard was to move away and to start considering uhm the relationships between the phonetic substance the phonological relations and the grammar and the semantics of the language

As he proposes in his well-known quote uhm that if we generalize syllabic structure in the new uh order of abstraction what we get is that we are enabled uhm to state uh the syntagmatic word structure of syllables with all their attributes 

Now that 's what 's crucial and that 's what 's important 

And what I want to do is I want to kind of show you the way in which we construct some of these uhm prosodic phonematic uhm and exponency issues within the synthesizer at York 

We 're using devices which are drawn uhm from computation and from mathematics

We 're using generalized syllable structures of a kind which is well known

We don't find these kinds of things in Firth

But if you look carefully at for instance the writings of uhm any of the prosodic phonologists it 's clear that they do not think of their formulae in linear terms on the page

There are structural relationships which obtain between the parts

Those who would see this kind of picture in a conventional linguistics text book would really imagine little Cs and Vs  or even the words consonant and vowels or little phoneme symbols written under here

In the model that we use at York  we take quite a different view 

That is we reconstruct prosodies  in such a way as to express contrastivity over domains 

And uh units which are terminal here are effectively phonematic units

What this graph represents is the fact that for English  uhm and this work owes uh not a little debt to Eileen Whitley  uhm  we have syllables which are distinct in being Y or W that is roughly front spread back rounded  being short or long 

We have rhymal contrasts which distinguish uhm between structures having H or non-H nasality or non-nasality checkedness or non-checkedness uhm

so what we 're dealing with in cases of H non-H are contrasts like bat bad

in checkedness versus non-checkedness in checkedness with nasality we 're dealing with things like uhm for instance with uh voice H and nasality

and checkedness we 're dealing with contrasts like bent bet uh bend

The reason for talking about them here at this rhymal node  is of course that we see their exponency effects over much larger domains

If you produces produce words like bat and bad the contrast which is typically in phonemic terms stated to be punctual and final is clearly observable

We can hear things that go around with that in the phonetics having to do with the vowel quality the phonatory quality of the vowel the duration of the vowel the relative resonance of the final consonants whether we get aspiration non-aspiration the potential for glottalisation and so on and so on 

Having got structures of this kind of course we have to listen to Firth 

Firth notes  the phonological structure of the sentence and the words which comprise it are to be expressed as a plurality of systems

I 'm not going to have anything to say uh particularly about how we implement polysystemicity within this approach  

So now we 're moving away from abstraction  phonological abstraction into exponency 

How do we deal with this

Well if we were to take our syllable graph as we had before and to produce a block diagram of this kind which sort of uh represents time we can see that one way of representing the relations within this graph would be that we could represent  certain amounts of hierarchicalness

we could say there are exponents of the syllable which cover the whole  uhm

onset exponents there precede rhyme

exponents nucleus exponents with the coda exponents

Now this captures the hierarchical nature of the kinds of claims that Firthian prosodic analysts make and that we want to represent

But what it doesn't do is it doesn't actually do service to the observed phonetics 

Why doesn't it do service to the observed phonetics

well

what we want is a story much more like this 

We want a story  where we want to say that  syllable exponents rhyme exponents and nucleus exponents are coextensive  and overlaid on each other and overlaid on them are onset exponents and coda exponents 

Nothing particularly new in this

Sadly Firth got there first 

Or happily Firth got there first 

The interpenetration of consonants and vowels the overlap  of so-called segments and of such layers of voice nasalization and aspiration  are quite commonplace in phonetics 

Uhm well yes they are but if one reads the literature uh one might be led to think otherwise 

OK

And so if we do that so if we take this notion of overlaying seriously what do we get

What do we get 

Well one of the defining and definitive characteristics of Firthian prosodic phonology  is that it is in contemporary parlance declarative  and monotonic and configurational 

Which means essentially that it 's a static theory  you are

once you 've created your representations your phonological formulae you are not allowed to insert information into them or remove information from them 

This of course is very uh interesting in contemporary terms in terms of cognitive modelling 

If we do this of course we obviate the need to have all kinds of very nasty destructive rules and processes in our phonology 

So for instance we can give a very nice account of coarticulation the gluing together of the segmental uh apparently segmental articulatory matter that goes round with words like keep car and coot in terms of their first consonantal bit  because what we can say is that the exponents of the onset are overlaid on the exponents of the syllable and nucleus

That is they inherit them directly

That is how you get coarticulation 

You don't have distinctively rounded and unrounded vowels

That 's a syllabic thing 

You don't have to copy features from vowels onto consonants to get the glue right

That 's a silly way of doing it

Why waste time doing something daft 

Let 's take another example

Let 's take deletion 

Deletion 's a pain 

Read any article on prosodic phonology

and the word deletion will not occur 

I 've gone through them very carefully 

You don't delete things 

Now  how does that fit with our observation that sometimes when we hear people speak there are bits missing  whatever that could mean

Well let 's take a couple of words  and these are totally decontextualised

This is totally non-Firthian but the data from which they derive were actually observed

Thank you very much for that introduction

Uhm I hope that this will follow on seamlessly from the previous  uh speaker uhm who certainly uh  made a graceful gesture uh towards Europe at the close of his speech for which I am very grateful

Uhm I think that as uh David  Baldwin 's speech indicated uhm looking to continental Europe  and trying to assess how Britain ranks alongside its European partners in terms of stocks  of skills is a sobering occupation 

We have to  admit that our employed workforce contains a smaller proportion of individuals with substantial formal training completed apprenticeship or recognised vocational qualifications than do Germany France or the Netherlands or any of the other advanced uhm countries in the European Community 

This situation is of course the result of our country 's failure to invest in education and training both in the distant and unfortunately in the more recent past 

Uhm the nineteen-eighties saw greater efforts  uhm for than for many decades to provide training for young people under the Y T S and its forerunners

and the uh amount of activity  and the number of young people enrolled was impressive 

Unfortunately  energies did not and resources did not stretch to ensuring that young people also gained vocational qualifications in the numbers that we would have needed under these schemes 

And evidence from surveys of the labour force over the past decade indicate that our training efforts in the nineteen-eighties  made almost no contribution to increasing numbers in the workforce holding vocational qualifications in this period 

This is something that we 've looked at in our research at the National Institute and uh we are left with the conclusion that we have uh still only just one quarter of our population holding uh completed apprenticeships or recognised vocational qualifications uhm just as we had at the beginning of the last decade  and the lack of progress is very worrying 

It would be possible to be more sanguine about this failure uh to invest in the past and in the more recent past if there were any signs that the situation was now as from nineteen-ninety a new decade being radically turned around 

But we have to recognise that it is not

Not yet

We are not providing  education and training of a standard comparable to that of competitor countries  to any more young people today than we were doing twenty years ago 

We are training more of our young people but we are not reaching the standards of our competitor countries and we have yet no reason to believe that these standards cannot be attained by our school-leavers

It 's a question of finding out how to achieve that 

At the same time we have to recognise that every year a fresh cohort of young people embarks upon employment of whom at least half receive no systematic vocational education and training which could lay the foundations and provide the flexibility that is required for a lifetime of twenty-first century working and living 

Together with colleagues from the National Institute and notably Zig Price I have for some time argued that it is folly not to address this problem urgently and immediately by all the means available to us  to take steps to ensure that not one not a single cohort more than is absolutely necessary should leave and go into employment without training which is sufficient for their working lives 

We must confront the vested interests which are obstructing and standing in the way of the necessary action

We have inherited in this country a multitude of examining bodies all doing excellent work

I think this is the first action that needs to be taken and we need to take it very soon 

The opportunity cost of catching up later when young people are already adult employees and providing them with substantial training on full adult wages is far greater than that of providing what is needed while they are still young  and of course legitimately dependent in part at least on support from parents 

So I would first of all urge that we try to prevent any more cohorts of young people launching themselves on employment as they traditionally have done without  first obtaining standards of uh vocational qualifications which are comparable to those of our European competitors

We have these qualifications

we have Betech qualifications

we have R S A

we have City and Guilds

We must get young people to understand them and employers to understand them and to achieve them

It 's not an impossible task

It can be done and it could be done soon if the will were applied 

Countries like France Germany and the Netherlands with a substantially superior skills base have higher productivity  and more surplus national income with which to finance their future training

so they are racing ahead of us even faster than uh we can possibly hope to uh pursue them 

We 've shown at the National Institute that if you take an industry which uh can be found in both uh say France uh Germany and Britain that the presence of a skilled workforce in Germany has a very  obvious uhm effect on the products which that country can produce

When we looked at the clothing industry in Germany we first of all found that eighty per cent of their machinists sitting at sewing machines had done a two-year training qualification 

In Britain the machinists

We We didn't find a single machinist who had done a similar who had achieved a similar qualification and this really showed in terms of what the German employers could expect of their employees 

They could expect very great flexibility uhm very much uh more varied production small batch sizes quick turnround uhm and uh a much faster response to markets

All of these qualities which were derived from a skilled workforce  put the Germans in a much more advantageous position than the British manufacturers on world markets

The Germans were able to uh export half their output of clothing  and uh into very high quality market uh market segments

The British manufacturers were n nowhere near this sort of uhm aim  and  the problem of the lower skills equilibrium we felt was neatly illustrated by this industry because employers here were locked into it 

They could not move out into the higher more varied production with higher value added while their workforce remained so badly trained 

and a real effort would be required to bring that workforce up to a standard which could achieve a different  outcome

This in my opinion lends urgency to the need to improve young people 's education and training in as cost-effective a manner as possible 

I think we have to ask ourselves also  whether the eleven years of full-time compulsory education which each and every child receives does all it could or should to lay the sure and solid foundation of knowledge attitude and motivation that will ensure for most pupils the success of vocational education and training  post sixteen

Thank you Sir Leonard and good evening ladies and gentlemen 

The title of this series of lectures tonight uh is Towards A Quality Workforce

and of course I accept what our Chairman said at the beginning about uh a quality workforce being something which is achieved by good management by good personnel management and by a range of things of that kind and that training is only a part of it

In my belief training and education are central to it nevertheless

and the idea of a quality workforce which is not well educated and well trained uh is uh something which I cannot uh believe is sensible uh to think possible 

Now  let me just underline at the outset that I hope that we can all agree we can certainly dispute it later if you don't that without a quality workforce  you can't produce quality products and services 

without those there is no quality economy that 's to say a prosperous economy  and therefore no high quality of life in terms of whatever you measure that by whether it 's incomes or health or homes or the environment uh opera

whatever it is we shall not have that kind of quality  if we do not have uh a prosperous economy founded on a quality workforce and I hope that 's agreed here 

So uh uh the next thing to stress is that the agenda is being set internationally by competition  and uh that if we cannot keep up with the competition then we shall uh have the kind of dire consequences which at the beginning of his talk uh David Baldwin uh was referring to 

So I suggest that it 's as well at the outset to agree with the statement which I hope is about to appear  uh total quality begins and ends with training 

Now let me just say first of all that uh training I take to mean ed all educational training which is related to work

and I so intend to use it throughout this uh talk

That is a saying by uh a Japanese guru uh called Akira Ishikawa

and I had it brought to my notice along with other people uh by Peter Wickins 

and uh I believe that it 's true

And that it uh is not only true and arresting

and therefore I think it is dismaying to hear the kinds of things that David Baldwin says about the untended garden of education and training in this country

I think it 's dismaying to hear the kinds of things which strike Hilary Steadman who is part as you know of the National Institute which has the unit which has perhaps done the most profound work on comparisons between this country and European countries and indeed other countries uh in this field

I call that dismaying

Uh

I 'm not going to harp on about it because actually I want to try and say uh how I think we can go forward

uh

but uh let us agree at the moment that the situation is serious that we don't seem to be uh  closing the gap uh as yet that we hear that Germany France and Holland are uh speeding along uh and improving what they do  uh and that uh we are are still not closing uh the gap 

Everyone agrees with that analysis I think certainly the C B I have come round to believing it certainly the T U C believes it and I think the Government believes it uh and there are plenty of initiatives around uh and therefore one has to uh think uh what are the problems 

Uh in saying that we 're not closing the gap let me just say that I think there there are some  very important exceptions 

I think one brilliant national exception is represented by what has happened in the polytechnics uh in the last decade 

There has been rapid expension expansion of our higher education from admittedly uh a rather narrow base 

but what we have as a result of the rapid expansion of the polytechnics is something that we 've never had before

and that 's a copious flow of young people into the labour market  backed by a work-related higher education 

Then again there are companies which are brilliant exceptions to the uh general rule

I think that decency makes me mention I B M U K uh uh in this list

and decency uh makes me mention Hewlett Packard 

uh bu

but you know for ex example other examples in the service sector such as Marks and Spencer uh and uh Sainsbury uh and British Airways

and British Airways I was learning the other day spends eighty million pounds a year on its customer service training

That 's a fantastic investment each year in that and in my belief and one watches these things doesn't one as one goes about uh it pays off 

So uh I would also add that our armed services are a brilliant exception I think to the uh neglect of training which we have in this country because the armed services uh clearly do uh believe deeply in training and are committed to do it

and it shows in what they can do 

and I think it 's  uh sad that it should be understood so fully uh in various parts of uh Britain and not understood nationally uh as it should be

We 're at our worst of course at intermediate skills  and uh they we we we 'd we on the whole rather despise uh practical skills

Our literature actually interestingly in my belief  uh rather neglects it

The only uh bit of literature whe where I really think practical skills are celebrated  uh th that I 've read at any rate is a book called The Wrench  by Primo Levi and published by uh Abacus which is a fascinating account of a highly practical man and what his life is like 

And uh as we 've heard already this evening very large numbers of our young people are coming to the workforce with no significant qualification and that 's very much less than in competitor countries 

Now of course there 's movement 

We have a setting up of the TECs which are the training enterprise councils of which there are about to be eighty-two 

uh

and don't let 's forget that they 've they they don't all exist yet even

it 's much too early to be jumping to conclusions

Well thank you very much for inviting me here

Uhm  I 'm going to as uh Ian says talk mainly about Eurotra

But I think I 'm going to try to  put uh Eurotra into  some kind of context of current research as well also past research to some extent

So actually what I 'm going to start by doing is just to  see uh just to sh say briefly about how Eurotra started 

And uhm  just just to remind everybody  uh those who need reminding

Oops wrong way round

Uhm this just gives you some idea  uh a graph of some idea of how machine translation res research has fluctuated over the years 

It started more or less uh im immediately after the war about nineteen forty-nine or thereabouts 

And then there was a big upsurge  in mainly in the United States which  came to a peak round about nineteen mid nineteen sixties with the Alpine report

And there was a dramatic drop as everybody knows I hope  uh until uh till you get to the mid seventies

And then there has been since then a gradual rise 

Now Eurotra 's position in this field more or less at this point here at at the lowest point  which may be of some interest 

Uhm 

What What happened was that the European communities found a need to have a large amount of translation work done because of the multilingual situation in Europe European communities

And in uh June nineteen seventy-five it had a demonstration of the Systran English French translation system

And on the basis of this they decided to invest in machine translation 

And apart from buying Systran and developing other  language pairs it decided to have a project  called Eurotra  uh to develop an advanced  multilingual system of machine translation 

Now by the  uh this time about the mid nineteen seventies it 'd been generally agreed that  the  the old syst the the  direct translation approach 

I don't know

I I mean

It must be

If anybody doesn't quite understand what  I mean by these various types of systems I 'd like people to  stop me and I 'll try to explain 

But the direct approach to machine translation  involves the building of one large dictionary and grammar  programmed for two specific languages  uh and a fairly complex program at that rate  one which could not be easi easily modified 

It is generally agreed that by the nine the mid nineteen seventies that this approach  through the use of Systran and many other systems was inherently uhm  incapable of development of great development 

Therefore by this time it 's generally agreed  that

Oh no sorry

Let me go back a bit

The foc The syst The The  approach which was adopted immediately after the direct system was known as the interlingua approach where you had one type of representation interlin uh an interlingua which was intermediary between  a source language and a target language

and you had two components for analysis and synthesis 

By nine mid nineteen seventies it was generally agreed that this also didn't work primarily because of the complexities of an interlingua 

So therefore by this time  it was agreed that uhm  the transfer approach  which is this should be  the basis for the development of new systems 

And in this just to remind you you have  an analysis component from a source language into an a source language interface of some kind  and a synthesis programme from tor target language interface to the target  text between the two  transfer systems

This was the model adopted by Eurotra 

Because of the la number of languages involved 

Uh Eurotra had uh when it began it had six languages I think

Now it has nine languages 

therefore there are altogether  seventy-two different pairs involved 

Because of the number of languages because it because it intended to be an inte multilingual system from the beginning  it was clear that this transfer component had to be as simple as possible because you had to do seventy-two of these 

Therefore it 's ab if it could be as abstract as possible it offers an advantage  which means therefore the analysis and the synthesis had to be fairly complex 

All right 

Now  uh the intention

Eurotra got formal approval from the Council of Ministers in November nineteen eighty-two

Actually planning it started in nineteen seventy-eight 

Uhm  and the uh development program was to be in two in three phases 

First phase from nineteen eighty-two to eighty-four  was to e establish the organisational framework  uhm with research groups funded by each country

And de And this was to define the basic linguistic and software specifications of the project 

Second phase which was to last from nineteen eighty-four to nineteen eighty-eight  was to to be devoted to the linguistic research necessary for a small demonstration system  of about two thousand five hundred lexical items  per language and to be tested on a particular corpus 

The third phase from nineteen eighty-eight to nineteen ninety  was intended to enlarge the system to deal with more complex texts  working with about twenty thousand lexical items  in each language  and not to restrict it to a particular text corpus 

Uh the domain of the prototype which is this one they 've developed I suppose that 's nineteen ninety  uhm has been limited to administrative texts minutes of meetings memoranda etc  and primarily in the field of information technology 

The final result which they hoped for this time was not to be a fully operational system but what they called a pre-industrial prototype  as the basis for a possible industrial development after the end of the research programme 

And as such the emphasis of the programme was on the quality of the output  uh reasonable good quality without significant human involvement without interaction of any kind  and also if possible without any post-editing 

And also they wanted to emphasise the extendability of the system  rather than the speed of the system

So it was very much a prototype not an indust not a finished system  from the very beginning 

Despite all this however the pro the progress was much slower than anticipated 

And uh by nineteen eighty-seven the European Parliament set up an independent evaluation committee 

Uhm this was re this resulted in what was called the Pannenborg Report 

And this criticised failures to resolve the problems of the management and and lack of central resources

Obviously Eurotra had a very great difficulty in administration dealing with nine or  twelve or thir thirteen different countries  all involved separately 

And it considered that the exclusive emphasis on the linguistic foundations  of the system had led to the neglect of the computational possibilities  particularly interactive uhm operation of the system  I 'll come back to this aspect later on  and that infi insufficient attention was paid to uh dictionary compilation 

It confirmed that a prototype was very unlikely by nineteen ninety which was pretty obvious to most observers by this time  and that no commercial system would appear by nineteen ninety-three 

This is the report of nineteen eighty-seven I 'm talking about at this point 

Nevertheless the project was held to have have made fundamental progress in the specification of the interfaces  and had succeeded in promoting computational linguistics research in a number of member countries 

The Pannenborg report recommended more realistic deadlines  the ending of the research phase in nineteen eighty-eight  and the establishment of closer links with industry for the development of a practical system 

And therefore the the Parliament approved this and uh transition to the next stage 

Things went on really not much different for the next two years until in March nineteen ninety another report was compiled called the Danzig report 

Put the name up if you like 

Uhm  this confwi confirmed the uh importance of the project as a stimulant to basic research 

In language technology one of the aims of the European Community has always been to stimulate research uh and Eurotra 's part in the project right from the beginning was to stimulate computational linguistics  so it agreed that it had done that 

It also agreed that it is very unlikely there would be an operational system 

It int anticipated that the result of Eurotra would be uh what they call a scientific definition prototype  rather than a pre-industrial development prototype 

Now if  anyone else could understand what the difference is between those I would be pleased to hear 

But I think basically what it means is it is not even going to be any use for any industrial partner to take over 

It 's going to be just the bare bones of the system 

It 's going to have a limited lexicon because not enough work has been done on the dictionaries and terminology

So we 're not even going to achieve twenty thousand word coverage which was the aim of the original system 

However the Danzig said report said that there were sufficient potential applications  these are monolingual as well as multilingual  of the research  that had been done to justify the work that 'd already been completed 

And the report recommended the continuation and broadening of the research  and the computational in computational linguistics 

Uhm  now this means therefore that the  Eurotra having begun as an extremely ambitious  project to develop a multilingual  M T system  based on the latest advances in computational linguistics it 's turned out and this is probably inevitable  that it 's a multi-national research programme in involved in computational linguistics  uhm and on the what they call the foundations of machine translation theory  in within a multilingual framework 

Uhm  but it 's not even that

It 's not they haven't  If I 'm going to be critical they 've not they haven't even reached a multilingual framework for a system because there are still great differences between one group in one country and other groups in other countries

So you 'll find that if you read any of the literature on Eurotra  you 're not at all sure whether this is the official  Eurotra design or whether this is  uh an in individual researcher 's ideas on what they think the official  uh design is  

Uhm  however despite all this despite the problems of organisation etc  Eurotra is the we could say is the first attempt to create a genuinely multilingual system 

Now you will hear that c certain other commercial  people will say that their system is a multilingual system 

Uhm Systran claims to be multilingual 

But Eurotra is the first system  I think I 'm absolutely right in saying this  which was designed from the very beginning to be a multilingual system 

So it 's designed as a multilingual system

It 's not a c conjunction of bilingual systems 

With apologies to Ivan over there even the Russian Sprint system is a conjunction of bilingual systems

It 's not based as a multilingual system to start with 

Uhm  now you remember that at the very beginning they the I said that the uh uh interlingua approach was at this time rejected 

And in fact the uh  the uhm  at that at that time although they adopted the transfer-based system  it is quite clear that as research has developed it 's become much closer to a kind of interlingua system  in the sense that if I can make it quite clear again  as   the list as this component becomes smaller and smaller 

As you get more and more research abstract research at two ends  you can find the more and more you got uh universal features which can be used as a kind of interlingua 

so Eurotra is becoming a kind of  hybrid  of the interlingua and transfer approach 

In fact they talk about their their uhm  interlingua elements as being Euroversals

In other words they are common to European languages 

Uhm  and the the Eurotra project has in fact has done a great deal of very interesting research on  these Euroversals in areas of  of tense uhm prepositions  uhm  conjunctions all these very difficult areas of computational linguistics 

It was obviously important from the very beginning that Eurotra should uh should have a very precise specification of the linguistic framework of the system 

Therefore it had to be extremely modular construction 

Uhm 

the other thing that having said from the very beginning that it 's not going to be an interactive system in any sense

it 's not going to involve human beings as as operators

It 's  is The intention has always been that the out some output from translation has to come

there has to be something 

Uhm even if the even if the input text is defective in any sense or even if the output is not fully  uhm specified then some output is essential 

Now they started from the at that time this is mid mid nineteen seventies  the assumption there was that the best starting-point for a s system was  the linguistic knowledge about syntax and vocabulary which was known at that time

In other words  it was very much and still is a linguistic system

There is no artificial intelligence in it no com no knowledge basis and as I 've said already no interactive system system 

Uhm  now this the other the other main thing which is  a feature of the system is that uh  Eurotra is very much a  quantificational system

The term clinical trial can be applied to any type of planned experiment which involves patients and is des designed to determine the most appropriate treatment for future patients with a given medical condition 

Historically medicine has advanced in a haphazard and in inefficient way

The first clinical trial wasn't  run until nineteen forty-eight and it 's only in recent years that it 's become widely recognised that properly conducted clinical trials which follow the principles of scientific experimentation provide the only reliable basis for evaluating the efficacy and safety of new treatments 

The essential characteristic of a clinical trial is that the results based on a limited sample of patients are used to make inferences about treatment for the general population of patients 

The main ethical problem of clinical trials is balancing the interests of the individuals in the trial with the potential benefit to a much larger number of patients in the future

Clinical trials are structured as for most scientific research as this flow chart shows

I 'll briefly cover the important considerations in the areas areas of design analysis and publication of trials and comment on the impact of trials in clinical practice 

There are two aspects of clinical trials which are essential for good scientific practice

The first is randomisation

Randomised clinical trials remain a reliable method for making specific comparisons between treatments

And randomisation is used for three specific purposes to safeguard against selection bias

otherwise doctors could wittingly or unwittingly pre-select patients for a particular treatment as insurance against accidental bias

And randomisation is essential to perform valid statistical tests

Most cancer trials are a randomisation between a sounder treatment and a new and hopefully better treatment

The second important factor is the size of the trial

There are important statistical and ethical implications in the choice of sample size

In general the smaller the difference between treatments that the doctor wishes to be able to detect the greater the number of patients needed

The size of the trial is decided by balancing statistical against practical considerations such as the expected recruitment of patients into the study and the limitations of time or money

Studies that are too small are extremely common and may be statistically and scientifically useless and therefore unethical in their use of patients and resources 

Irrespective of what treatment pat the patient actually did receive after randomisation on to a study the patients must be analysed in the group they were randomised to

All statistical analyses must be on an intention to treat basis only 

For tri for trials in potentially fatal diseases such as cancer the main evaluation is whether the patient dies or not and at what point in time after randomisation

This analysis can be displayed graphically as shown here

For each treatment group a life table or survival curve estimates the percentage of patients surviving any to any point in time 

A significance test compares the two curves and tests the null hypothesis

Here treatment A is better than treatment B and is in fact significantly better 

There are many patient characteristics which may predict the patient 's survival

The study of these prognostic factors plays an important role in an analysis of clinical studies 

The whole purpose of a clinical trial is to advance knowledge and therefore it is important that all randomised clinical trials should be published irrespective of their results

Unfortunately there is tends to be a bias towards publishing only positive results

There is also a danger of publishing trials with too small patient numbers which can po can produce false positive results and exaggerated treatment claims

Clinicians need to make critical evaluations of the papers in the medical journals 

The separation of patients into good and poor prognostic groups can assist in the design of future studies either as radical curative studies or studies with palliative intent only

Unfortunately in cancer research small improvements between treatments is all that can realistically be expected and therefore studies with large patient numbers are needed often in in excess of four hundred patients

It 's an illness in which depressed mood is a feature that 's  consistently present for a period of several weeks at least

Or if the mood isn't depressed then there must be at least uhm very consistent and severe loss of interest in life or or loss of enjoyment and a lot of uh vegetative symptoms such as loss of energy poor sleep poor appetite and weight loss uh a loss of motivation 

And a variety of stresses can bring on a depressive illness

and they may be physical stresses such as illness in particular virus infections and disturbances of hormone balance

Or the stresses may be psychological ones uhm bereavement divorce or marriage come to that  loss of one 's job

And it 's therefore not at all surprising that uhm one seriously stressful event occurring in the lives of most women childbirth is also associated with a higher incidence of depressive illness

What 's not so clear is whether it is the physiological or the psychological component of the stress that 's most responsible for producing the symptoms of depression

I believe that the study which I 'm just going to tell you about may throw a little light on that

What I was doing was uh doing a retrospective survey to discover if women who had given birth by Caesarean section were more likely to have depressive illness than those who had a normal delivery

To that end I took a sample of a hundred and thirteen women  of which consecutively had Caesarean sections in the maternity unit at Farnborough Hospital and a hundred women who 'd had normal deliveries uhm within the previous year

I sent them a questionnaire containing a checklist of symptoms of depression often only requiring a simple yes no answer whether they had had those symptoms or not 

I don't expect you to take any of these in but this is a uh sample of some of the symptoms that occur 

And these two slides 

I 'll let you look at that one for a minute and then go back to the others

Then I had ninety replies from the Caesarean patients and seventy-five from the from the controls 

The k key finding of the whole study and there are sev there were several others was that the uh women who had had a Caesarean section were indeed significantly more likely to have suffered from a depressive illness than those which 'd had a normal delivery

 I did a chi square test on this as you can see

And  the original design of this study was matched pairs

Because of the incomplete uh response to my questionnaire I only had fifty pairs but uh they were matched for age the number of previous children that they had had and uh the season of giving birth

And  by McEnroe 's test there was a slightly more significant result produced

Uhm  this difference between the two groups practically disappeared when I used stricter criteria for depression  which obviously suggests that the excessive depressive illness among the Caesarean cases consisted of people suffering from a milder sort of illness 

And I think this was borne out by a comparison of severity if I 've got these slides in the right order  between the two groups using the  using the number of symptoms as as a criterion 

Uh I 'm afraid this does not show very well graphically

But the the uh those who 'd had a Caesarean section were more likely to have had an illness involving only seven different symptoms of depression 

Besides severity  I also looked at the time course of the illness and made a comparison of the two groups

Illnesses of the Caesarean subjects tended to come on earlier

more than seventy per cent within the first month 

Whereas for those who 'd had normal delivery and had a depressive illness only forty per cent of the illnesses came on in the first month

There was also a trend for the Caesarean subjects ' illnesses to be shorter than the illnesses among the control group but this achieved significance only at the ten per cent level

The sum of all my studies seems to have shown there is more depressive illness among people who 've had a Caesarean section and that there is a tendency for the illnesses to be milder shorter and to come on sooner after the birth

Uhm the work I 'm doing at the moment is named a survey of global bifurcations in periodically forced oscillators

Uhm  I can draw a picture that might help to motivate what this actually means 

If you imagine If you imagine a potential well or a potential surface that looks like this  or maybe looks like this and imagine that there 's a ball  in this surface  and this surface is maybe resting on a table  that 's being periodically pushed in this direction  the ball begins to move in the potential well

and maybe it will develop periodic motions of its own

maybe it 'll appear to develop random  large amplitude motions

maybe it will even  develop such large amplitude motions it jumps out of the well

This is basically what these two equations are representing

The first term represents the acceleration of the ball the second term the X dot term represents the energy loss of the ball due to friction

The minus X plus X cubed or the plus X minus X squared represents the shape of the potential function and the A sine omega T or the F sine omega T  represents the periodic forcing that that system experiences 

The reason I 'm interested in looking at these equations is that they model a large variety of physical phenomena such as ship capsize or a beam buckling

And my strategy is very much to try and get the simplest possible equation and to understand all the different possibilities that can arise from it 

I called this little talk a survey of global bifurcations

I 'm not actually going to present a survey

This is more like the introduction that I give in a longer talk

But a bifurcation is a discontinuous change in a system

And people are beginning to be very interested in how a discontinuous change in the state of a system may arise if for example my ball which may be oscillating  changes from having small amplitude motion maybe just reaching here or large amplitude motion that moves from one side of the potential well to the other

A global bifurcation is something that takes into consider into consideration all possible boundary conditions or starting conditions of the system 

If I was going to  present uhm a longer talk I 'd start off with a summary of what I was going to try and achieve in maybe forty-five minutes or an hour

And I basically made a list of the different stages I 'd go through if I was examining the system uhm or the different points I 'd try to put across in a longer presentation

I started off by describing how I treat the data how I view the data uh pictorially

and maybe show some slides as examples

I then discuss possible solutions

and by that I mean whether I could have the ball balancing at the top of the potential  structurally unstably or whether I could have it balancing at the bottom of the potential or whether I could have it with small amplitude periodic motions

I then define what I meant by an attractor which is essentially a solution that has some finite probability of being achieved and a basin which is the set of conditions that would lead to that solution

I then bring in some mathematical terms such as stable and unstable manifolds and use them to provide a form of definition of for example a basin boundary

I then talk about how I would like to predict different bifurcation phenomena and introduce some ideas that I 'm very interested in personally uhm homoclinic and heteroclinic interceptions

And then I talk a little about something that 's been in the press a lot recently

I 'll have to run through one or two of the words here

Uh thermophiles are bacteria which grow in my case between uh fifty and seventy-five degrees C

There are several other classes of thermophilical organisms

There 's the extreme thermophiles which grow at between seventy-five and ninety and the archibacteria which grow between ninety-five and the highest recorded which was growth at a hundred and five degrees C uh paradictim which has an optimum growth up to a hundred and ten 

So uhm  uhm uhm esterases

Well an esterase is an enzyme which cleaves an esterbond the C double bond O O being the esterlinkage and the R and R prime being any other organic groups such as benzine rings or carbon chains

Uhm the esterase along with water

The normal specificity of the esterase is to go to an acid and an alcohol

Uh this is a reversible reaction which is important to some of my later work 

Also we have organic solvents like self-explanatory in this case organic solvents which is alcohols ethers esters

And biocatalysis is the use of enzymes in organic reactions 

So why do I want to use  esterases 

Well esterases are able in organic solvents to carry out a number of useful can you hear me all right now organic uhm processes to produce things like food products

Uhm gallate an effective anti-oxidant in the food industry is produced on multi-term quantities and also the synthetic sweetener aspartine is produced using uh esters

Uh flavours and perfumes

These can be isolated from plants

but they 're usually very expensive to do

and you don't get much yield for the work that you put in

Uhm organic intermediates for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals

A lot of work around cheiro products

I don't want to go into what cheiro products are but  they 're used in pharmaceuticals

The enzymes give you a particular form of this

And also esterases from microbial rather than uhm heart and liver from animals are a lot cheaper than  produced otherwise

Oops 

Why thermophiles

Well before I go on to what why thermophiles I want to say why we 're talking about organic solvents 

Uhm a lot of the organic products produced these days aren't soluble in water so we 'll have to do them in organic solvents

Therefore you have a high high reactor substrate concentration that 's a greater reactive capacity 

You get an increased substrate solubility 

You get a higher retention of biocatalyst activity

That 's an organic water system rather than just a pure organic solvent

Have an easier approach recovery from organic solvent from water and get decreased substrate and fault inhibition and but the most important in my case is the possibility of the thermodynamically unfavourable reactions

We go to the first slide  which is gone

Sorry 

This reaction that I 've stated is reversible

Uhm the esterase plus the water gives you the acid and the alcohol

The acid and alcohols aren't really very useful in industry

And what we can do is if we take the water away and put it in an organic system is we can push the reaction the other way

so we can have an acid and alcohol and give it to the esterase which is a useful product 

And my thermophiles

Uh my supervisor has shown along with the post-op several years ago  that the thermoph the proteins from thermophiles are more stable than the proteins from mesophiles

And all this graph shows is that the mesophiles are at this end

And after an hour 's incubation at various temperatures the amount of protein left in the mesophiles is a lot less than the protein left in the therm in the thermophiles

And this also uh corresponds to  uhm the stability in organic solvents whereby the stability of organic solvents in the mesophiles that the protein is a lot less than the protein left in the organic solvents

That 's it

Thank you

Now this  is a is a graphical  user interface system for computer programs so that you can control a computer program via a mouse and various other  graphical means

You don't have to remember how to type

You don't have to remember how to  spell and things like this

so it makes using a computer application far more simpler simple especially for the non-computer-literate person 

The main advantage with this system is that it 's supported by most of the main computer manufacturers throughout the world  therefore that no matter what systems you end up working on in what country in the world you will be able to use this windowing system

So it 's got a fairly good advantage in its vast generality 

It was originally developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology

And from there it 's been sub-developed by lots and lots of other different universities and major companies 

One of its key features is that of it being what 's called network transparent 

Now this allows you to have a major computer system that is doing all your calculations

And you can have a much smaller computer sy computer system that is displaying all your results through the graphical fronting

And these are  s these can be split over a complete network so you could run your computer program on a machine in the United States and you could have all your graphics and results coming up on a screen in U C L which is quite quite a nice advantage for spreading around computer power 

The way it manages to achieve this is it uses what 's called the client server  method of communication 

If I can just wander over  to the board

This means that we have  we have our main computer system that 's doing all the hardware calculations and working out all the maths for us and we have our graphics terminal 

And these communicate with each other so that there 's a set protocol on this boundary as to what  instructions this screen will receive

And that uh actual interface is a recognised international standard so that if you run your program on any computer it will output the same graphical instructions  to any of the ex-graphical terminals and allow you to  work from anywhere that you particularly choose 

One other thing about this system is that U C L Computer Centre are using this as their standard for front-ends to computer applications

Uh throughout the college they 're installing quite a number of new computer clusters in all departments and they will use this windowing front-end as the basis for their computer applications

Psychological reactions to torture

A four-theme model 

There 's increasing awareness of the harmful long-term consequences of exposure to organised state violence including torture

Survivors are likely to experience adverse physical and psychological effects 

Tanner and Gore Stansworth my co-presenters have developed a four-dimensional model of reactions to torture 

This model recognises that torture is an activity with complex psychological and physical sequelae affecting not only individual survivors but whole communities as well

Their framework helps us to understand reactions seen in survivors of torture in terms of the following four dimensions 

Firstly incomplete emotional processing 

Secondly  depressive reactions

Thirdly somatoformal bodily complaints

And finally there is the existential dilemma 

I need to briefly talk about a study that examines clinical evidence in favour of the four-theme model among a sample of clients who were attending the London-based charity the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture 

The samples studied were a hundred consecutive referrals to the foundation

There were seventy-eight men and twenty-two women and the mean age was thirty-one 

Among our sample of a hundred survivors fifty-eight per cent  fifty-eight subjects came from the Middle East including twenty-two Kurds and thirty-six non-Kurds 

Smaller numbers came from elsewhere from Africa predominantly as well as Asia South America  and  Europe 

Our sample had suffered a range of different forms of torture 

They all described experiencing psychological torture

And sixty-eight per cent had also experienced one or more forms of physical torture 

Two-thirds sixty-five subjects had experienced impact violence including beating and falacca 

Falacca is a particular form of torture in which the victim is held down and the soles of the feet are whipped or beaten with a light cane 

Sometimes there may be no scars at the time

But in other cases infected wounds develop and the survivor often goes on to suffer chronic pain which may be very difficult to treat 

We also see that  forty-eight p per cent gave accounts of being deprived of either food or water or basic living conditions facilities for significant lengths of time 

Subjects also described sexual torture in twenty-three cases and other physical forms of torture for example electrical torture and torture using high-pressure hoses 

Looking now at psychological torture in a little more detail

This might involve threats to the self or threats to other people

Subjects also described  accounts experiences of sensory deprivation with twenty-eight individuals having periods of prolonged isolation and twenty-seven of blindfolding 

Perhaps most distressing of all were the experiences of hearing or being made to watch other people being tortured 

Twelve people also described going through a mock execution 

What is the evidence then for our four-theme model of the reactions to torture

I work in the Physiology Department 

Uhm I 'm one of  a large number of people doing research onto s into mechanisms of stimulus secretion coupling 

This is really cell biology where we look at cells that produce a product  uhm all different cells producing different products

but the thing they have in common is they package the product into the granule 

and when the cell 's stimulated the granule is released 

My  particular field is G protein regulation of phospholypase C  which I 'll  further explain 

So in stimulus secretion coupling the stimulus  activates the cell on the outside usually 

and a number of things happen in the middle before we get to secretion

and these pathways which unfortunately aren't a straight simple line like this but more like a bowl of spaghetti  are open to a lot of research because firstly in a number of diseases there 's something wrong with one of the pathways

An enzyme which goes to the next step is missing 

And the other main field of research is where you want to manipulate the cell 

for instance you want to make it produce more or less of the substance  that that it 's secreting

And uhm  pharmacology companies are very interested in uh pursuing this this line of research 

So if we sort of settle down and  look at a tiny part of one of the pathways

and the particular enzyme that I I 'm researching into is phospholypase C 

This  uhm acts as a membrane lipid 

so a part of the membrane is formed by this substance name which fortunately we can call pic two

And the phospholypase C enzyme hacks here to form two two products  I P three   and 

And both of these uhm products uh form  uh trigger pathways in the cell

this one by releasing calcium 

and this one by activating another enzyme called protein 

And these are kind of ubiquitous  uhm triggers of secretion  that 

It 's like a currency

They 're common to al most cell types  possibly all cell types if enough were examined in in great detail and it 's  to get to this part of the pathway that I 'm interested in

So my research is on the top part  which is how the the stimulus from outside the cell triggers the activation of this enzyme so it 's a very early part of the secretory pathway

And how it does it is by having a a protein called a G protein  which is short  everything is in initials for guanine nucleotide binding protein  that sits in the cell membrane and in its resting state  is bound to G D P 

When the receptor on the outside of the cell is activated to stimulate the cell  a small part of this protein  is activated and dissociates away from the membrane 

And the reason it dissociates is because receptor occupancy means that G T P replaces G D P  on this subunit and this activated state is able  to activate the enzyme  and hence the rest of the pathway 

So  in all biochemical systems there has to be an off switch as well because otherwise  things would burn out

so  uhm it 's been fou found that this subunit has its own off switch where it can break down G T P back to G D P

so a cycle is formed 

So to summarize

The agonist on the outside of the cell which in the cells I look at  which are white blood cells neutrophils is bacteria  is recognised by the receptor on the exterior of the cell 

and that  reacts with the G protein  which will then activate the phospholy phospholypase C and  be the beginning of the pathway leading on to secretion at the end

My name is Sharon Spencer and I work for the cancer research campaign molecular toxicology group headed by Professor Brian Ketterer

In this group our main interest is in uh developing an understanding of the mechanisms that c cause cancer with an aim to uhm devising strategies for cancer treatment and cancer prevention

To this end we look principally at the group of enzymes called the glutathione transferases which are detoxification enzymes

Now a general type of reaction conducted by the glutathione transferases is shown here whereby the tripeptide glutathione shown here as G S H is conjugated to this uhm nitro compound

You get displacement of this X group here

and you get a conjugate form S G with H S X as the the additional product

And this compound then becomes more easily excreted from the body

So glutathione transferases are important because they detoxify compounds that are potentially carcinogenic and mutagenic and allow them to be excreted from the body 

Right

The glutathione transferases are widely distributed in plants and animals  and can be further subdivided into four groups  namely alpha mu pi and theta

Now this diagram here just shows the distribution of these subfamilies between humans rats and mice

Each subfamily is represented by one or more enzymes  from each group

In I am My research is particularly interested in looking at pi family which is represented by G S T pi in the human subunit seven in the rat and M two in the mouse 

Now why am I interested in glutathione transferase pi

Principally for th three reasons 

First of all pi has increased expression in the range of neural malignancies such as malignant melanoma renal carcinoma and lung carcinoma 

It also has increased expression in drug resistant neural cell lines such as the breast cancer cell line  M C F seven uh when it acquires adriamycin drug resistance 

It is also present in what is termed the eleven Q thirteen  which is a region of human chromosome eleven which is increased in a range of human cancers

Also present in this  along with the human G S T pi gene are the oncogenes  and  and also other leucites such as B C L one and M E M one 

So to understand some of the mechanisms contributing to the increased expression of the pi gene  workers originally tried to compare the pi gene with its uhm rat  orthologue or equivalent structural gene called G S T P or subunit seven 

Uhm

looking quickly through this uhm human G S T pi and rat  sorry uhm G S T P gene are highly similar

They both are encoded by seven axons which are these black  s s structures and have uh a group of equivalent regulatory elements

Firstly this this here showing T A T A which is called a tata box  and uh these this G uhm sequence here which is called a G C box  which are very important for regulating basal level of expressions of these enzymes 

The rat enzyme is also uhm has uh uh what is called here a T R E sequence which is important for increasing the level of this enzyme over the basal level 

This T R E sequence as shown here is also present in the human pi gene but is non-functional 

so therefore i it still at this stage was not understood what mechanisms were important for increasing the level of expression in this en of this enzyme over basal 

So thoughts have actually been turned towards trying to determine what other genes may be present  uhm next to the pi gene on chromosome eleven which could be important for its regulation 

So in my work I 've taken three what are termed to be cosmic clones which encode pi genes shown here as these black boxes

and I 'm trying to look both upstream of these black boxes and downstream of these black boxes  to identify other genes which could be important in switching on  the the gene expression and ultimately increasing the levels of this enzyme 

So finally  the aim of my work  is to determine the chromosomal loci or other genes which are associated with glutathione transferase pi 

Tied to that we would like to det uhm to elucidate the mechanisms involved in regulation of the glutathione transferase pi  and also a determination of the involvement of glutathione transferase pi expression in the tumour phenotype

Does glutathione transferase pi actually increase in tumours principally because it 's actually adjacent to another gene which is a driming driving force for tumour development 

Right thank you

I work in the Department of Oncology and my main involvement is mainly into research of a particular type of lung cancer 

I shall explain a little about this disease and the way in which we are trying to improve on the survival of lung cancer patients 

The causes of lung cancer which  I 'm sure most of you  know about  

Uhm the main cause is smoking

Ninety per cent of lung cancer patients are smokers 

Uhm passive smoking

It 's a contentious issue but studies have shown  that it may increase the risk of lung cancer by twenty-five to thirty-five per cent 

Air pollution uh is another possible cause

There is an increased incidence in urban areas 

and uhm asbestos people who work with asbestos and smokers who are exposed to asbestos  uhm have a forty-five per cent increased incidence of lung cancer 

Other industrial causes are exposure to nickel iron radon and coal gas 

The uhm costs of smoking are known particularly the economic uhm  benefits in tobacco consumption

There 's much revenue gained in income tax  uhm much revenue gained from those for those who farm it and for those who advertise it

Uh few are aware of the significant deforestation which occurs that about twelve per cent of all trees cut down are used for tobacco curling 

And of course there is uhm the cost uh in terms of accidental fires as well 

There are two types  of lung cancer  small cell which accounts for twenty-five per cent uh sorry small cell which accounts for twenty-five per cent of lung cancers tumours and non-small cell 

Uh

non-small cell are broken up into three further groups squamous adeno and large cell cancers 

This is a diagram of the respiratory system taken from front to back starting with the mouth and down to the base of the lungs uh just above the diaphragm 

This is a cross-section mid view looking down through the chest with the lungs on either side  the spine at the back and the sternum at the front

About seventy-five per cent of tumours will start  within the main bronchial tree  here

And  the tumours spread from the primary site  to

They either spread locally from the primary site to within to within the lung or they spread  through the the blood system and the lymphatic system particularly to the brain and to the liver  and to the bones and to the bone marrow 

About seventy-five per cent of patients who present to their doctors will have extensive disease that is disease beyond the primary  site of the uh tumour which is usually arises within within the lung 

Uhm sadly the prognosis of lung cancer remains poor with only five to ten per cent of patients with limited disease alive at two years and only two per cent of patients  alive at five years 

Uhm untreated patients with limited disease would die in about three months 

Although lung tumours are responsive to radiotherapy  chemotherapy is the treatment of choice because as I said the majority of patients will present with extensive disease 

Radiotherapy will only treat one particular area 

chemotherapy will treat the whole body and hopefully the cytotoxic drugs will affect all tumour sites 

Studies over the years have shown us which the most effective drugs are and how much to use 

The standard treatment for lung cancer would be to give about three to five cytotoxic drugs every three weeks for about six courses 

However we 've devised a regimen which is far more dose-intensive 

Uhm here the treatment is given every week for twelve weeks 

Patients entered on to this study would be randomised to receive a standard three-weekly regimen  or the weekly intensive regimen 

This diagram starts at week nought so whilst one tends to think of the three-weekly regimen six courses every three weeks running into eighteen weeks  the di diagram here actually stops at fifteen weeks 

But if you take those patients  on the weekly regimen who finish their treatment at  this point in time here  they will have received a much higher overall dose than patients on the three-weekly regimen at the same point in time

Right

All of my research is actually directed towards the development of a computer  operated telephone enquiry service 

This is where you have members of the public phoning up and booking a flight or asking making an enquiry about a certain flight and hou carrying out their entire conversation with a computer 

But in order to do this we have to analyse how humans behave when they talk to computers because they react very differently than when they think they 're talking to humans 

So we 're going to carry out what 's known as a Wizard of Oz simulation 

And here 's our  Wizard of Oz simulation scenario

What you do is you invite in a member of the st the public who is the subject 

You give them a a specific task such as  book a flight from Barcelona to Paris on such and such a day at a certain time

You sit them in a room and tell them they 're going to be phoning up and talking to a computer 

So they are primed before they start 

The accomplice is a trained operator

He 's the wizard 

And what he does is pretend to be a computer

Uh his task is to mimic all the parts of the computer system which have not yet been developed 

In our case we haven't developed it at all  so we 're starting right from scratch

He 's got to do the whole thing 

The main thing he does t to begin with is the speech understanding

He recognises what the u what the subject has said to him  and understands what they want 

Then he carries out the task of dialogue management 

This involves  these three things the simulation tools

Previously real dialogues between humans  in the tasks that we 're going to use have been analysed

We 've uhm recorded you know enquiries to B A or something like that 

And those are used to set up a model of the dialogue  a real one and this database which includes all the sorts of things which the human information giver had used when he answered the questions 

So once the accomplice here has worked out what the subject wants to know  he uses these two to work out the content of his response and the wording of it

Then what he does is the construction of the output templates in our case will be typing into a computer which will then send a synthesized speech message to the subject 

Here 's uhm I 'll just show you the actual setup we 're going to be using 

The wizard will sit in one room here  in the room next door to the subject

There 's a two-way mirror

The wizard can see the subject but the subject cannot see through to the wizard

She doesn't know there 's anybody there 

I s I mean she 's supposed to really believe that she 's got a computer on the end of the phone or on the other end of the microphone 

The wizard can hear the subject through his headphones then types his response into the synthesizer in front of him 

And the subject will talk into the microphone  and can hear obviously the synthesized speech through his headphones 

There is another way of doing it

and that 's talking to what you call a vocoder

and when you do this it distorts the speech 

and it flattens out the intonations

so it sounds fairly mechanical 

But the problem is if the wizard hesitates or stumbles or says anything wrong  it 's uhm you know it 's qui it becomes quite clear that it 's actually a person and not a computer after all 

There are several things that the wizard has to do  in order to make it more convincing that he 's a computer

First of all he has to leave  quite a substantial d delay before responding  s so that would be a realistic length of time for computer processing to take place 

But as well as that he has to fail to understand quite a few things the human says 

So for example if the human  makes very long complex sentences or isn't clear in his requests the computer just says I do not understand please rephrase 

But the output from the com from the wizard is also also has to be constrained in terms of insofar as he has to use very limited sentence constructions just subject verb object never volunteer any extra information he wouldn't be expected to know  and  you know just use 

Oh sorry

I can't go on

I guess I messed it up right at the end

Well having done all that  we will then carry out several Wizard of Oz simulations re-analyse all the results and then we 'll go back to this stage again 

The model of the dialogue and the database will then be made up from our new  uhm corpus of dialogues based on humans and computers 

And that 's it

Thank you

The Book of Malachi  the last of the prophets has uh a literary structure that 's unique among the Prophets 

It 's divided into six sections  and in each section  there 's a special structure

First  a brief proposition put forward by the prophet usually critical of Israel 

He says sort of one sentence 

And then the people retort to that quite rudely at times but uh in pretty brief terms 

And then the prophet takes up the speech again

And uh he answers this time at some length pursuing his argument 

And quite often the unit ends with an announcement of the action which God is going to take uh in view of the conclusion reached by the song 

Occasionally one of these elements is missing but that is the basic structure of each unit and there are six such units 

Well the first of these is in Chapter One Verses Two to Five

Chapter One Verse One gives the title of the book and the name of the prophet Malachi

but that 's something that I would prefer to discuss when we 've got further into the book 

So the first section proper is Chapter One Verses Two to Five  where the prophet starts off with the proposition

I love you

says the Lord directed to the Israelites

and you say 

in what respect do you love us

You see the people 's bold reply

And then Malachi answers them

He says well if you think God doesn't love you you only need look over the border to Edom uh the country in the  to the south of Israel where they are about to be invaded or have been invaded

This is apparently a reference to the Nambotian invasions which took place at what we will see was the time of Malachi 

Their mountains have become desolate

And that  that 's the way God treats the people that he does not love

So you can see that God must love you 

This is the only one of the six sections which isn't directly critical of Israel 

The second section runs from Chapter One Verse Six down into Chapter Two Verse Nine 

There we hear th that uh priests are refusing to honour God in the cult

They are sacrificing animals of inferior quality 

The section is actually addressed to priests as he very clearly says in uh the first verse of this section





And then he tells them how you 've been offering on my altar bread that is to be despised



The section ends in an announcement of judgement the judgement that will fall upon them where he says in Two Verse Nine I shall make you victims of contempt  since you do not keep my ways 

Then comes the third section the third of the six in Chapter Two Verses Ten to Sixteen  where Malachi is complaining about what seem to be two evils

First the people of Judah his audience have uh married foreign women or as he puts it the daughter of a strange god  and they have betrayed their wives

As Malachi later says they 've actually divorced their wives

So that it seems that they divorced their former Jewish wives in order to marry foreign women 

The reference to the marriage of foreign women is unfortunately not entirely clear 

It lies in that one phrase He has possessed the daughter of a strange god in Chapter Two Verse Eleven 

Some people think that the reference is not to foreign marriage but to idolatry

And some people very much like to cut out the phrase altogether in order to have a simple condemnation  against divorce

But It 's all very well to cut out a phrase

but how does one explain how it came to be there in the first place 

So on the whole the traditional explanation is  right I think that they have actually been divorcing their Jewish wives to marry foreign women

And that is the  subject of this  debate this third section 

The very opening of this section is interesting 

The Uh by this I mean the first half of Verse Ten 



It 's not clear whether this is what Malachi is saying or what the people are saying

If it 's what Malachi is saying that would agree with the usual form that the section will start with Malachi 's own words that the voice of the prophet is heard first 

But if that is what Malachi is saying then the voice of the people is not heard at all

There 's no opportunity to hear any  counter-blast from the people

And many wonder whether this first half a verse do we not all have one father did not one God create us is what the people say 

Hence in order to justify their foreign marriages they say  why should anyone object to our marrying women who are not from our own people

Do we not all have one father

Did not one God create us

You see that might be the people 's contention 

So the people 's voice is heard first

This would be unusual you see

But we would at least hear the people

And then the prophet comes in and says

well

even if we all have one father that 's no excuse for betraying each other and in particular for men to betray their wives and to take foreign wives 

The fourth section begins in Chapter Two Verse Seventeen  and it runs down to Chapter Three Verse Five 

Here  the people say 

all those who do evil are good in the eyes of the Lord

and in them he delights

for where is the God of Justice 

That is to say the people rationalise their sinful ways by denying that God is just altogether 

The prophet responds to this by saying that God will show to them all too clearly how just he is by coming against them in judgement

And his messenger will come

He speaks in the name of God







It 's at this point that I think I can return to this theme of the name of the prophet

He 's called Malachi in the opening verse but no biographical information is given about him

He 's not called Malachi son of anyone or said to have come from a certain place 

And what arouses one 's suspicions is that that very same Hebrew form Malachi  means my messenger and occurs in the text at Chapter Three Verse One

God says behold I am sending my messenger 

It 's true that in theory the name Malachi could be construed not as my messenger but as messenger of Yah messenger of the Lord

You do get a few names like this with an E at the end which is a contracted form of Jah the Divine Name like the name Ure which seems to be contracted for Ure Yah light of God 

But messenger of God if one were to analyse Malachi in that way  is an unlikely choice for any father to give his son so that one may really doubt whether the name Malachi is a real name

And it 's interesting that even the Greek and Aramaic versions the Septuagint and Targum show doubts about it

The Greek version in the opening verse doesn't say that this is the Book of Malachi uh but the prophecy God spoke through his messenger 

Uh similarly uh the Targum says that Malachi was simply a nickname an extra name  of another biblical figure Ezra the Scribe 

And ah it does rather look as if the editor of what are now the twelve prophets  had before him a number of prophets going up to Zechariah

And then after Zechariah he found  a few other collections 

He  gave these collections these three collections as it turned out to be more or less uniform titles

He called them all the Burden of the Word of the Lord 

Here we we find this unusual expression in Zechariah Chapter Nine Verse One



Uh we find it again in Zechariah Twelve Verse One 

And  he gave a similar title to the third collection  whence the burden of the word of the Lord unto Israel in Malachi One Verse One 

And anxious to have twelve named prophets it seems that he took from Chapter Three Verse One  the word Malachi my messenger  and made it into a name and placed it at the beginning of the book 

So that he interpreted the editor interpreted Chapter Three Verse One behold I am sending my messenger to mean God is sending a prophet as a messenger and thus calling him Malachi 

With that let 's proceed to the fifth of the sections of the book uh Chapter Three Verses uh Six to Twelve 

These  start off by  disputing the proposition that the Lord has changed

He says I the Lord have not changed and you unfortunately children of Jacob have not changed either because you have turned aside from my statutes

Evidently  one of the arguments that was going about in the mouths of the people in order to justify their  turning their backs on religion was that the Lord had changed

He wasn't the same God that he 'd been before

and he didn't deserve to be worshipped as he had before

And thus it 's necessary for Malachi to begin this new section I the Lord have not changed

And he goes on to complain that the people have been trying to cheat God 

And when they say how have we cheated you his answer is that they have failed to pay their tithes

They are not properly financing  the Temple service 

And Malachi says that the droughts that they 've been suffering  and the locusts that have been eating their produce are simply punishments for that failure and if they pay the tithes nat nature will be bountiful 

And this little section ends uh with a prophecy of salvation



This concept that the agriculture  depends on  whether the people support the Temple or not is one which you may have met in the Book of Haggai as well

Haggai also says that the harvest has failed and that 's because they haven't paid their tithes and supported the Temple 

The last section runs for Chapter Three Verse Thirteen to Twenty-One 

Here it seems  that people are denigrating obedience to God in general

They are saying  as Verse Fourteen puts it it is vain to serve God

What have we gained by keeping His charge and walking carefully  in fear of the Lord God 

They go on to say that the doers of wickedness are built up

That is to say they are secure



They The sinner prospers

He avoids all punishment 

To this Malachi replies that God is simply waiting

He keeps a book a Book of Memorial 

There are recorded the acts of the righteous and the wicked

And there will be a great reckoning in the end

And in this reckoning the righteous and the wicked will be distinguished and will be differently treated have diametrically opposite fates 

And then there is an epilogue to the book in the last three verses  saying

remember the teaching of my servant Moses which I commanded him in Horeb

Horeb is another name for Mount Sinai 



That is to say Elijah will provide a last opportunity for repentance 

Notice how this section is somewhat at odds with the earlier part of the chapter  because in Chapter Three Verse One it was said

Behold I am sending My messenger

and suddenly  the Lord that you seek will enter into His temple

The author of Chapter Three Verse One expected a very swift appearance of God 

He expected the judgement to be imminent 

The author of Three Verses Twenty-Two to Twenty-Four apparently lives in a time when such hopes had been disappointed 

He can only look forward to the coming of Elijah the prophet

That is now indefinitely delayed

The reason that it 's Elijah the prophet is uh presumably  that he expects a prophet 

He expects a prophet because of the reference in Three Verse One to my messenger

But on the other hand he 's living in an age when prophecy has  fallen into discredit

No new prophets are emerging

People who do come forward claiming to be prophets are promptly sat upon and told that  this is something shameful this is audacious

Uhm  I 'm talking about the relationship between innovation and research

I 've thrown in the word industrial and academic partly because that slide wasn't prepared specifically fo for for this talk but for another one 

Uh and it it 's certainly uh I think a fair assumption that uh when talking about innovation most people assume that innovation is something that 's carried out within the industrial context

But let me say before I go any further that that isn't a fair assumption and that what uh I will try and illustrate what I mean by innovation and how it 's different from and subsumes research

But innovation to a large extent can be considered to be an attitude of mind and in some things it is equally applicable in uh an academic institution as as it is is in industry

It 's really a question of exploiting new ideas in a useful context 

If I could have the

Sorry

Sorry sorry 

Uhm

so I 'm going to talk about first of all why innovate the role of research and collaboration

I won't take say too much on this occasion about the role of government or the  adverse or malignant role of government

That That 's a a separate discussion in its own right 

Uhm

there are many ways that

I 'm just going to use two or three examples just to suggest why uhm becoming rather better at innovation is rather important

I mean

if you look at the the share of world  merchandise exports Germany eleven point four per cent U K five point one per cent

If you look at the corresponding data incidentally from uh just about a hundred years before uhm those percentages were pretty well reversed

That at that stage uh the U K had I think about thirteen or fourteen per cent and Germany had about five per cent

So if you just make that comparison it suggests that maybe there is something wrong or certainly not right 

Another way you can look at the same situation if you look at the different debts of international labour costs

If you like that 's a measure of  uh how much people are paid and and hence how much they earn in terms of the value that they have in the provision of goods and services

And you can see where the U K is

We 're down here with with Ireland uh just above Spain

That was in nineteen eighty-seven

so we 're probably below Spain by now uhm and slumping towards the bottom

And you can understand why Mrs Thatcher in particular was particularly keen on the expansion of the European Community to embrace uhm the the Soviet bloc and preferably Albania to make sure that they 'll always be one or two propping us up off the bottom 

One way

I I think that this is quite a nice diagram and I can say that because it isn't mine

I Uh I took this from a report by Christopher Ball

And he talks about the the vicious circle that we 've got ourselves into over probably a hundred and fifty years  in which

And this shows the interaction between what happens to the U K viewed as an industrial complex and the what happens to the the citizens of the U K

But we have this combination of

I 'm not sure where to start as with any vicious circle

but I think maybe a good way to start is to is to start with low aspirations I think because that is a major cultural problem that the English have

I could Again I could go on about the genetic causes or possibly the religious causes of that

but I think there is a problem that the English I u use the word English advisedly do start out with low aspirations when it comes to education and training

So as a result of these low aspirations we therefore have low standards

Uh this leads in general to low skills

And these low skills are reflected in low salaries and wages and low satisfaction which doesn't exactly help the aspirations

And the impact on the economy is that the the low skills lead to low productivity and low profit and low investment and of course the inability to pay higher salaries and wages and so on and so forth

And that 's the situation that we 've been in  as I say for for at least a hundred maybe a hundred and fifty years maybe more

Uh I will come back to uh a more optimistic view of that situation right at the end 

Let me also point out what could happen to companies that don't innovate 

Uhm if you look back uh whatever that is thirty-seven years to nineteen fifty-four and I 'm using the electronics industry as an illustration  then in the United States there were the the top five electronic component companies each of which  arguably was spending uh large and and adequate sums of money on research

so that wasn't their weakness

But nevertheless those were the leading companies R C A Silvenior G E Laker and Westinghouse

By nineteen seventy-nine they 'd all disappeared from the scene as far as the top five were concerned and the leading companies were Texas Instruments National Name and Tom Fairchild

This is an old slide that I first produced in about nineteen eighty

And so I was asking the question about what would happen twenty-five years on

Uh well the first thing that 's happened is that Fairchild has disappeared that they 've been taken over by National

Texas is still well I would say that they 're not number one

Belintel is number one

Texas is going through very serious troubles

From having been the predominant company for many years they 're really under threat from the Japanese so that if one has to guess what that list would look like uhm maybe I should think of it as world companies rather than U S

But in the year two thousand and four that will probably read at present uhm Nippon Electric Hitachi Toshiba Fujitsu and I 'm not sure who the fifth might be

So that 's a measure of what can happen when you get one group of organisations that are innovative and another that aren't

And it makes the point that the lack of innovation the lack of recognition of change and how to  uh manipulate it and control it was a management problem within these companies

It didn't relate to the fact that they were not spending  uh very considerable sums on research 

The What I described as the environment for innovatory growth is uh very simply represented here

that if you think of the activities within an organisation as embracing the various activities of marketing research development manufacturing  then you have certain products that you have to sell today

and you have to generate enough profit and enough cash out of today 's sales to feed back into the business together with new ideas and new people so that the combination of those three inputs enable you to generate new products and and new markets for the future

So that 's really what the process  is all about 

One way 

Yes uhm management obviously has a role  in that process first of all to ensure that the existing business generates profit and cash

I mean

if a company is in real financial trouble then it becomes impossible no matter how well intentioned to actually afford the the various steps involved in research development and the other aspects of of innovation

It 's also important for management to provide an environment in which people and ideas can develop

And it has to have an attitude  that it is willing to reinvest today 's profit and cash in tomorrow 's business growth

But the most important role of management is to think

Uh you may think that that is self-evident

Uh well maybe it is self-evident but it doesn't often happen

Uhm 

again going back historically John Stuart Mill uh suggested that in when he was writing in Germany the national attitude was they had knowledge without thought France thought without knowledge and then England neither thought nor knowledge

So it 's not a new problem 

Now I find it quite useful and th this is obviously somewhat simplified but nevertheless quite useful to recognise the the concept of something I choose to call the innovation chain

Uhm the reason is that it 's well known that the chain is only as strong as its its weakest link

And this is true of the total process of innovation

Uh again I will come back to this with a particular illustration at the end

But the point is that the sequence of uhm of events in principle is that uh basic research is carried on in general within the university sector but exploited by an industrial company

strategic research carried out as you 'll see both within the university sector and within industry

applied research predominantly within industry leading into product and process of manufacturing method department into manufacturing into selling into installation and servicing in order to provide satisfaction to a customer

Notice the distinction between selling and marketing

There is a very real distinction

The trouble is that they become blurred

Uh

I guess it was in the late nineteen sixties when salesmen became somewhat uhm disturbed by the image of being called a salesman

and so they started calling themselves marketing executives in the hope that you know their wives felt better about it or the husband felt better about it and they got a bigger car and bigger salary

But this this is really very damaging

And it 's one of our basic U K problems because marketing is something which has got nothing directly to do with selling

Selling is what you do to persuade people to d to buy today what you 've got to offer to them today

Marketing is the activity which is concerned with understanding the marketplace understanding your customers not just today 's customers but understanding what your future customers might be and turning that understanding into a strategy for research and development to make sure that in the future there are future products that the salesman can sell 

Uh as I said the point is that you have to be good at everything 

Uhm

in some instances the more the some of the most successful companies achieve their success by being sort of moderately good in in many areas

and then they can finally blow it all by being very bad there for example

And when you look at the bad performance of of the company it is attention to that which is needed to put it right

A very good example of that some years ago  was with with the the Hotpoint company

But their products were as good as anybody else 's

There  There was nothing much to choose between them

But the image that they had in in the marketplace was pretty terrible

And they acquired a new managing director

And he again thought

And he went and he talked to people

And he listened to them

And he came to the conclusion that what was wrong and where some innovation was needed was in the method of paying the service engineers because the service engineers were being paid a bonus based on the number of calls they made

and they also got a percentage of the value of the number of spare parts that they installed

Now if you think about it I mean could you have anything more stupid

Instead of the salesman turning up and looking at a washing machine and finding that you know maybe one of the pulleys needed adjustment he would say uhm

That 's very difficult

I 'll have to go away and come back with a new motor

And that way he gets ten per cent or whatever it was of the the cost of the motor and he makes two visits instead of one

So once that was realised and an end was put to that the th th the performance in actuality and the perception of the performance was changed dramatically and the sales uh of Hotpoint shot forward

So innovation  i is something which can apply in all areas

I 've left accountancy  off here because I mean with many people including me it 's something of a dirty word

But the But even there to be innovative in how you handle your accounts can be equally important

Some of the classical ways of in which organisations measure their costs  in which they assume that their  manufacturing process is dominated by labour people doing things instead of recognising their costs are dominated mainly by the running costs of very expensive machines

And so that the costs are not being dominated by labour costs at all

they 're dominated by the depreciation of maintenance costs on a very expensive machine

Now that 's all very obvious

but when you follow that through you 've got the means to give rise to a change in the method of accounting that 's adopted within a company

So innovation isn't something as I said which should be limited to  what we think of as as research

We live I begin by saying in a period when consciousness of time  is peculiarly vivid  especially when you 've waited half an hour in the cold

not in the cold

but I was  of both present  past and future time 

As for present time no body of coevals  no generation as we usually call it  was ever more aware of its own day  its own modern  or postmodern day than we are 

It 's true of the past  since we have a whole industry of persons  set apart uh sorry quite apart from professional historians  set apart to re-create the past in a way that people can live in it all over again 

A day a meal  for as long as you like  in the imagination of a generation like ours obsessed I think  with the attempt to put themselves back in past time as well as to live intensely as they do  in the present 

It applies in my view  for the future too 

And this I would like to try and convince you of as we go along 

The proof of this point about our  ever present sense

Am I all right at the back

can you hear me 

All right 

You 've only got to glance at the ecological movement with its anxious awareness of the needs the rights the aspirations of future people 

Perhaps even more of the future globe  the future of our globe  our planet  as we call it with our accustomed arrogance 

And so  absolutely necessary  is it to preserve it  that a whole movement a whole attitude  has arisen up  around that thought which is a thought of course about the future  not simply uh just beyond tomorrow  but presumably a future inde inde  i indefinite

Now this is an attitude which I report with all due scholarly sobriety because I happen to 've done a lot of work on it recently 

This is an attitude the sense of the future to which we 're responsible  which is indeed also unique in our own day 

No previous generation that I can discover  no-one really before the late nineteen seventies perhaps a little earlier but certainly very recently  has ever formulated for itself  a doctrine of the rights of future persons  to control  our actions  rights  that we should take decisions  which may be to our advantage  but which we judge  as being to theirs 

Now my task this evening  is to put the case for those in the third age  being  trustees of the future as Charles has said 

A case of course not for dogmatic assertion  but for discussion and de if it 's possible for some sort of demonstration 

If I am right  this is a new duty or a newly-defined duty 

And it is even more clearly  uh the new duty of a new society 

For no previous body  of humans in Britain  Europe  or anywhere else in the world  has ever before had a society of the third age 

Those of us who feel ourselves to be in it sitting here  you may perhaps some of them be like myself a member of the University of the third age  can reflect 

there 've never been people like us before at least with that consciousness of ourselves  that consciousness of ourselves  in the life course  that consciousness of ourselves as having as I want to insist this evening  having responsibilities 

It 's time  I defined a little  and said a word or two  about  the third age as  a cou  a part of the course of life  and related it with its predecessors

Those of you who know these  to me rather over-familiar definitions must bear a minute or two with me a minute or two while I go over them to make myself clear 

The first age  according to A Fresh Map Of Life  is one of infinite infant nurturance  of socialisation of education  and for the most part of dependence 

absolute dependence to begin with 

but tapering off  at the end except perhaps in the matter of finance

The first-agers are often dependent even into their second age on those older than themselves 

The second age is the big one  though incidentally getting smaller and smaller all the time because of the  rise in  the educational time taken before you enter it  and the increasing tendency for retirement to cur to occur earlier 

It is the age at least officially of entire independence  of caring  of earning  of a career  of procreation  of parenthood  of political and social participation  and often leadership  of production  of wealth creation 

It is also the age of the foundation of families  and to some extent  always in relation to the endowment of the individual  and his or her good fortune  an age of achievement 

But and this is usually regarded as the surprise of the analytic system I 'm describing though it 's already been referred to by  the chairman it is not the age  in this  analysis of the life course

it is not the age  of personal achievement 

It is not that interlude of experience of all of us  At least nowadays it is not that interlude in the experience of all of us when the crown of individual life  is attained 

For the third age  the third age Sorry perhaps I injected a negative 

it is the third age not the second age which is that of self-realisation  of attaining personal ends  of having the leisure the means the experience the poise the confidence  to do your own thing 

The final The fourth age is of course a very different affair  and is  the age of final dependence and frequently though not by any means always by no means always of decrepitude and decline 

Its distinguishing feature from the point of view of the discussion of life course in this scheme  is that it need not happen

It 's not something that everyone goes through  and which everyone  but certainly is something which everyone has an interest in avoiding 

There 're one or two further points about this uh  division of the life course which is so important to my subject and the notion of the third age generally which I shall just run my fingers over 

Now  to me  uh the immodest inventor of that particular system  the boundaries of the four ages  are  of crucial importance 

If not fixed  certainly not fixed by calendar age

There 's no calendar age above which  you  become a third-ager  a term I don't like which is certainly getting some currency because it 's a social matter  it 's a matter of personal choice 

And the imposition of calendar age on everybody  by social life and by bureaucracy is something which I think we 're right strongly to resist 

Nevertheless  the transition is real 

The ages and the transfer between those ages are to me as important as the thesis that they exist at all 

For example  if a person 's in the third age  which for most of us means they 're retired from their jobs  for those in the third age  to want a job  to take back  not simply the rewards  but the trammels of the second age  is in a way  to go back on the system  to deny by implication  that the third age  is a thing  that it is distinct from the second 

The membership of the four ages therefore is not as definite  as perhaps  might be expected 

And the reality of those uh  ages and their membership  is perhaps best illustrated by the example  of the second age in relation to the third itself 

For a woman 

and one of the great difficulties of  elaborating theories of this kind  one of the great difficulties is that you 've got to be one sex or another 

and it 's extremely difficult for a as masculine a character  as I find myself in looking at the evidence  to be properly sympathetic  to the other gender 

But the reality of the second age for a woman  and the importance of the transition to the third  is I think a key element in the system 

When the children have left home  when that which traditionally  though not of course  uh as conspicuously in our own time  when  in traditional vocabulary and outlook a woman has had her children  her children note  one should say when couples have had their children but I 'm trying to take the experience of women  uh as as if it were isolable in a rather old-fashioned way  their object is not to keep the family as a unit

The success of a woman 's second age  is to  watch the children grow up and go away  ending  the second experience from her point of view 

And I think it 's also in a sense the same type of phenomenon  for their husbands or for males generally 

Retirement is unwelcome to many people 

It is forced on many people 

Its  bureaucratic guillotine-like character  is an oppression  an oppression  which  is harder on Englishmen and Englishwomen than any other European as far as I can see 

Nevertheless  it  corresponds  to a very real element  in the   of male and female human life 

There is this sense  that we 're in a temporal procession  and it 's correct  to make way for our juniors  that the ve vital life stream has to be renewed  that you can be too definite about the roles attached to points in the life course 

But as I insist  they are real 

I 've talked of the  tendency of some people dissatisfied  with retirement and they may have been unjustly unjustly treated in being put there  wishing to get back into the second age 

But what is most conspicuous about the third age at least in my experience with the University of the Third Age is how little  that attitude  is found  how clearly being in the third-age  is something which corresponds to spontaneous self-image  and desire 

That then 's a point I wish to insist on  uh because it 's important I think for my general  consideration  of the thesis as a whole and the trusteeship question  uh in particular 

There 's a third feature or further feature of the ages which uh is something  I should mention because uh it 's been that the feature of A Fresh Map Of Life which has attracted most criticism 

It is that although the third age defined in this sort of way  defined as a stage of life  defined as socially created of course  although it is  in that sense  a period of everybody 's life  not quite like that because because to be at leisure  to realise yourself  to be able  to read and understand  culminate what you 've wanted to do for yourself  you 've got to live in a society  uh which can afford you  which is 

Well there are in position mechanisms  for persons to say  and institutions particularly educational institutions widely spread through society which will enable a third-ager  to live a life I 've hinted at 

And it 's perfectly possible

and I insist on that to me a rather sad point very strongly in A Fresh Map Of Life 

it 's perfectly possible and is beginning to happen  that you 'll have  countries with enough people  of an age chronological age here is being used to be in the third age  but which don't  have the money  and the institutions which would enable  that  period of life to be as described for anybody in it except for  an elite few 

It 's not generally known that the expectation of life in China  is now well up with western  expectations of life 

It 's not recognised I think  that many poor countries like China  are going to have vast numbers of persons  as dependent  on the second age as the first is dependent on them without the wealth without the transfer mechanisms  without all the  social apparatus making it possible to achieve  a third-age life

That 's an incidental point 

but it 's one incidental  to what I now wish to confess to which so many people find unacceptable 

Defined as an age of achievement a third age can be lived alongside  of this theory  as the first or the second 

If you 're already very very good at your job  as a second-age occupation  or ones we wouldn't think of that way 

If you 're very very good at something and can realise yourself  before  well most of us can as retired you can live in a way  your third age alongside the second or even the first if you 're  a champion runner for example 

But the paradigmatic figures for the third age  are the cultural heroes like Mozart  this year 's cultural hero  who clearly as a boy  a toddler  was living a life of achievement  attained by almost nobody else who can be thought of as a rival  or of our own Henry Moore 

Well Sir Nicholas  ladies and gentleman  uh

first of all welcome  here tonight

It 's always rather surprising when people  actually come and hear what one has to say

I must confess

But I would like to thank  Sir Nicholas very much for agreeing to be my chairman

He is an extraordinarily busy man

And and the praise he misguidedly uhm ascribes to me is much more due to himself

for if anyone has been a benevolent liberalising influence but at the highest levels of our legal system it is he

And uhm many years and uhm triumphs are still to come from where he sits

I hope

I 'd like to thank the society for giving me the opportunity to  give this talk

I 'd like to thank Penny Egan sitting alongside Sir Nicholas for the work done in bringing the occasion together 

Well my subject Citizen Who  Citizen How is is perhaps you may think an odd one 

Citizenship by its very nature will always be a variable and contested concept  subjected to much a academic debate from Greek periods onwards 

Tonight I hope you 'll not mind if I eschew the academic and pursue a more earthy albeit reflective tack analysing the soil within which citizenship can root and thrive

And in so doing I I must necessarily be selective partial and personal given the heroic scale of the subject 

Insofar as it 's relevant I 'm content to accept the description of education for citizenship in the National Curriculum Council Guidance Paper Number Eight of that name published last November which I abbreviate thus

The aim of education for citizenship

And now of course citizenship is one of five cross-curricular themes in the National Curriculum

The aim is to help pupils to acquire knowledge and skills on the one hand and attitudes values and motivation on the other which together will enable them to explore and exercise their rights and responsibilities in the democratic society 

I 'm also happy to acknowledge even if I do not uh uh shall not be directly discussing the work done over many years under the auspices of the Hansard Society and by the Politics Association as well as the report last year of the Speaker 's Commission on citizenship which contained a valuable review of the field together with a long agenda of practical proposals

I 'm only sorry that the Speaker 's intention to be present tonight has been frustrated

But I 'm glad that others of his commission are here 

There 's also of course Charter Eighty-Eight a new non-party constitutional campaign with now twenty-five thousand subscribers which is taking up the whole subject of citizenship as indeed are a number of institutions such as Leicester University and many individuals 

Lately too citizenship has entered the party political arena

And there is today quite a scramble by each of the major parties to appropriate the word

Long may they fail 

But their interest is all to the good

For decades the political establishment has done little to admit let alone bridge the chasm of ignorance and helplessness which has opened up between the ideal of citizenship and the reality 

Although the Royal Commission on Legal Services noted in nineteen seventy-nine the pressing need for law-related education in schools and although two years before that an H M schools inspectorate report rhetorically asked what has the curriculum done to help school-leavers in legal matters of fundamental importance to adult life  Professor McGurk of Surrey University was in nineteen eighty-seven still driven to conclude his extensive researches into these issues by saying 

I 'd be happier if he 'd said what

what is it about British life

but there we are 

Maybe it was because I found much academic study of the law almost wilfully obscure and introverted that I felt for the common bloke whose benefit it was all supposed to be 

So in the late sixties I persuaded a tolerant secondary school head in Sudbury Suffolk to let me loose on a class of fifteen- and sixteen-year-olds for one lesson a week 

I wanted to find out what they knew and whether they could be interested in the values procedures and principles of the law 

I vividly remember their relief almost elation as soon as it dawned on them that what is the law and what is fair are by no means necessarily the same  and that the object of politics in a democracy is precisely to allow every citizen to contend for or support proposals for narrowing that gap 

In one leap as it were  the unravelling of that frustrating knot made the law approachable for them where it had been alien in need of their care and attention rather than their resentment amendable not carved in stone 

Soon I had each of them proposing the law they 'd most like to see enacted sorting out as they readily did the essential components of an effective statute and the basic rules of drafting 

They and I were hooked

So I remain

Citizenship could rule and it was certainly OK 

Despite excellent work by the four year law and education project which my chairman has referred to funded as he said by the Law Society and run in conjunction with the predecessor of the National Curriculum Council school-leavers today know little more about the legal political and social world they 're heading for than did they did a decade ago whilst meanwhile their dependence on and indeed dominance by the law has increased inexorably 

If Parliament will not restrain its law-making zeal it should at least have addressed this state of affairs by making legal advice and assistance available to the myriad caught in its tentacles 

Yet Mr Justice Darling 's jibe about legal redress being available to everyone like the Ritz is ever more true

Legal aid is in deep crisis and our proud claim of equality before the law is hypocrisy 

Furthermore our neglect of the consequences for the public of the uhm maxim ignorance of the law is no excuse has no excuse

M Ps must know that our youngsters wallow in near total ignorance 

That is not to imply criticism of our schools overburdened as they already are with new obligations without commensurate resources 

I sometimes think s Mao Tse Tung had one good idea 

What untold benefits might not flow from requiring M Ps and their Whitehall mandarins to spend one week a year working for example in one of the thousand Citizens ' Advice Bureaux which are expected this year to deal with over eight million cases of citizen citizen ignorance confusion and distress 

And why not dispatch the senior judges my chairman excepted of course to preside in the overburdened magistrates ' courts of this land which handle over ninety-seven per cent of the national caseload

And perhaps to show due impartiality I 'd also tip out the commercial lawyers of the City and Temple to work in high street general practices and law centres many of which are opting out of legal aid right now wracked by the unviable state remuneration or local authority grant cutbacks on the one hand and unparalleled unmet demand on the other 

This experience might just quicken the hearts and inform the minds of these influential people to the realisation that their bit of civil society in Britain is degenerating dangerously 

It is not only that our criminal laws are being broken more profligately than ever

Over four million offences of violence or dishonesty last year

Up by nearly a fifth 

It 's more that all the signs are that fewer people respect the law 

Police public confidence continues to dissolve 

Confidence in the judicial process falters

Scepticism about fair and equal treatment of offenders and alleged offenders grows 

In a survey of one and a half thousand fifteen- to eighteen-year-olds which the Citizenship Foundation has just done  a quarter revealed that they 'd been assaulted though most of them were too afraid to report it and a big majority had serious concerns for their safety 

Over a half had had something stolen and also knew a thief 

Another aim of my no doubt pie-in-the-sky role-change would be to stimulate commitment to a series of reforms big and small to transform legal services with vital benefits for citizenship

For example one one might look to the appointment of a non-lawyer as Minister of Justice with the prime task of delivering legal services effectively 

One might require a plain English version of every statute plus an inte an intel intelligible resum&eacute; with illustrative flow charts

commission tip-top broadcast campaigns to explain the bones of major new laws perhaps even institute a six to nine months public service period to round off the training of every new lawyer which would be spent for example in the lower courts or on secondment to advice centres and charities 

Above all there should be sensible funding of the legal aid scheme

The seven hundred million pounds net cost last year the price of five Tornadoes is simply not enough to defend fifty-five million people against injustice 

Part of my pipedream would be to make legislators realise that putting fine rights on the statute book is barren work unless they are delivered

Who knows

That might even redirect the energy devoted by solicitors and barristers to their own demarcation dispute to their real calling 

Some may wonder whether all this is the true stuff of citizenship

And to that I unequivocally say yes 

Any attempt at inculcating notions of citizenship in our young adults is surely condemned to vacuousness unless the legal system itself broadly exemplifies its own ideals in its treatment of them 

Far from this happy state of affairs existing it is as I say in retreat 

Although the causes are many and complex one component is the never-ending cascade of legislation which last year devour devoured many thousands of pages of Hallsbury 's Statutes and Statutory Instruments

And I can't resist digressing to tell you of a not untypical paper bullet which lately shot across my desk The National Health Service and Community Care Act Nineteen Ninety Commencement Number Six and Amendment and Transitional and Savings Provisions Order Nineteen Ninety Number Two Five Double One

And all to regulate local representative committees 

If all this is driving lawyers into ever narrower deeper ruts of specialisation what hope for the public 

In fact the trend suits the lawyers rather well making them more indispensable for those of course who can afford their escalating fees

So it is that the law conceived as the protector of the weak against the strong too often today operates in reverse 

We 're getting back to the eighteenth century condition where Goldsmith observed

lords grind the poor

and rich men make the law 

Lawyers are increasingly used as mercenaries in unarmed but deadly combat 

Willingness to be so used poses or should pose a rising dilemma for my profession 

Justice is not as common a word in lawyers ' offices as it should be 

I would controversially add that quite apart from the money the undeniab undeniable intellectual fascination flowing from microspecialisation also infects those of us who try sometimes to be on the side of the angels

It can lead to a disproportionate preoccupation for example with esoteric tax issues which may affect only a handful of people invariably the already-advantaged as compared with the unattended deserts of popular ills particularly in fields of poverty law and tribunals 

The stultifying effects of all this cause even those best able to cope to groan 

Look for example at the financial services sector and the Financial Services Act 

Such an overburden of inorganic regulation has insidious side-effects 

Though internalised moral autonomy individual and institutional is so much the best governor of human conduct  it is undermined and sometimes ousted by laws which nonetheless rarely provide more than a lowest common denominator

Yet the increasing external regulation without that internal underpinning eventually leads to a descent into more law-breaking which begets yet more law

As Hirsch wrote fifteen years ago in Social Limits To Growth it leads to I quote a rising mass of codified petty regulation swollen by the need for rules to enforce rules and to counter their avoidance 





These laments are hardly new 

On the eighteenth of October sixteen forty-seven five regiments of the parliamentary army encamped at Putney debated the state of the nation and published their propositions

One urged and I quote

Plus &ccedille;a change

Could I have the  slides on please and the lights down 

Good evening or good afternoon  

I invite you this evening  to come  and basically to enjoy the slides  but also  if you have a taste for such things to read between the lines  and  take a a kind of ride  in my own specially  and deliberately constructed ark  this evening 

I believe that such an ark is very necessary at this time 

I think there 's no doubt of that 

Because not only the shifts of fortune  and the extraordinary politics of say the last three years  leave none of us as  relaxed or as torpid  as we 'd like to be 

But then it 's endlessly debatable  as to whether it 's architecture  or the surrounding culture  that is more  in a kind of tizzwazz situation that is in greater disarray 

I think that it 's the lazy  and the cynical  who always say  we get the architecture we deserve 

We deserve better 

So I think it 's the role of a professor of architecture  or his friends  to hone away at that issue  to hone away  at the task  of making that better architecture  or finding it  or concocticking

Concocting it  or  in lieu of that of juxtaposing certain funny people together  in still or in smoky cabins  of the ark  digging out old charts  plotting new itineraries  and from time to time  sailing away as did the old explorers  convinced as they were of the existence of the Northwest Passage or the possible proximity  of the hidden Atlantis 

Indeed at no other time  has the construction of the ark been so propitious 

The old gusto of the twentieth century

I like often to intone a kind of quasi Time magazine statement which uh like all Time magazine statements you can't really  deny because in a sense it 's fatuous

But I like I like to invent this statement which is within  the twentieth century 

more architectural ideas  have been set up  than in the whole of recorded history 

Well in a sense you can't deny it 

So And I think that old gusto of that century is still there to draw upon  and to stir  into the slipstreams  of the current fads or the new technologies  to stir into the time-saving devices  to stir into the relaxedness  of a hybrid culture 

Now outside my ark  there rolls a skea a seascape  of grey monotony  and the greenness of the common denominator 

Of course the occasional squall blows up  characterised by breezes that come out from irrelevant directions  usually stylistic  each of a minor variation from the last 

And perhaps in a lifetime or in a century  only one or two times does a major storm occur  to threaten  our vessel 

Depending on the vessel and depending upon who we are it might take a number of different types of storm

It might be something  that would interest some and not others such as you know the the the  invention of injection moulding

That might be the storm that suddenly makes everything completely different 

Or for others  it might be  the contemplation  of let 's say Marcel Duchamp 's large glass 

Before  and after it 's completely different in one 's mind because it suddenly  causes everything to realign itself

For some of us it might be  the second sighting  of the airship 

Now Noah  I think had quite good reasons for inviting his company onto the ark  two by two 

And since one 's familiar with the double carousel projector system I shall do the same 

Could we go back on the left here

It 's jumped 

Thank you 

On the left Frank Geary

On the right Ron Herron 

And below each of the people as they come up there 'll always be the work of the one on the one side and the one on the other side 

I must have Frank Geary and Ron Herron on board 

Both of them are perennial enthusiasts for architecture 

And as they glide past the sixty-year-old mark  they 're as lively as we imagine twenty-year-olds ought to be 

Frank  in Los Angeles is surrounded by enthusiastic youngsters  who plot lines on enormous sheets of paper whilst he himself hacks and pummels and digs and  fixes and glues and packs away in tins innumerable cardboard models and spins them round on turntables 

In London  Ron is surrounded by enthusiastic youngsters including  two  sons of his own  tapping away at Macintosh desktops  while he sits in the corner scribbling away with a fat pen 

They both skip around their cities around Los Angeles  in Frank 's case or London in Ron 's case  dropping in and out of schools of architecture  dropping in and out of parties  dropping in and out of architects ' gatherings  and not least and I think this is very important  dropping in to other people 's studios 

I think this is a far cry from the old isolated arrogant notion of the master architect and his acolytes 

Both started making buildings around the age of twenty 

And both came out of the modernist inspiration  with Geary  on record as saying about his Danziger studio  uh hoping to make architecture that you bump into before you realise it 's architecture 

I personally think that the Danziger studio 's extremely elegant and that if you do bump you bump  in a delicious way 

Meanwhile  down  in the Gray 's Inn Road  Ron at an extraordinarily early age had designed the Star Cross School  with more than a whiff of Copa Cabana more than a whiff of looking at what was going on perhaps in places such as Brazil

Whether schools ' architects in the present moment would be allowed to do such a thing  I I wonder 

And it 's still there with a lot of crap built into it 

But it 's it 's still basically there 

Something funny with the left hand 

D' you think that it 's all right 

Now  something stra interesting and untypical happened to both of them  as middle age began to beckon 

There was a marvellous architectural explosion 

Geary 's Vermilion House which I showed you  is but one of a whole clutch of blown apart Los Angeleno houses  Angeleno boxes in fact 

But always blown apart with a knowingness  of the scale and of the dynamic of space  which is the central issue in architecture

In Herron 's case  the conversations that went on amongst us in the group called Archegram were never more succinctly formalised than by his elegant placement because if you look past the  very  clear overtones of both of these pieces of architecture there is still that issue  of the understanding of placement  that perhaps did also come out of the modernist inspiration  albeit that the conversations within the Archegram group  seemed anarchic 

They were concerned with exploding architecture itself 

And and they were drawing inspiration not from Palladio  not from Lutyens  not even always from Le Corbusier  but from car production hovercraft balloons robots 

But his walking city for that it is on the right  is both a hybrid machine 

but at the same time intriguingly it is in the tradition of what I would call citadel

And to take two other twentieth-century examples one thinks of Hans Hollein 's placement  of the aircraft carrier on the hilltop  in Austria

Or one actually takes Le Corbusier 's Unit&eacute; d'Habitation  in Marseilles 

So in fact indeed anti-architecture returns also to being  a part of a very special architectural tradition 

For neither of them however was the real life that they actually led to be ignored  because both delight  in their  way of life in their suburbs 

Geary  in the lifestyle of Santa Monica 

Ron Herron in the lifestyle of Woodford Green 

Frank has re-modelled an ordinary suburban frame house into an art work  and really does live in it with his young family as well as a hundred pieces of art

Whereas Ron has applied his most radical projects to such things as the Woodford Green or the London suburbia in general that he knows best  both lovingly  and ironically 

For this  on the right his suburban set project suggests that the street frontage  is respectable  conformist 

But behind my god what 's going on

Behind you can live out your wish-dreams as a bomber pilot  or as a beach bum  still of course enjoying the benefits  of normal mod cons 

Both men  are artists

This is the inevitable conclusion

Their explosiveness and radicalism has cleared the tubes 

It has enabled them to make  in their current period  architecture that is actually very fundamental  that bypasses the finicky mannerisms of British architecture  that is oh so worried not to upset and oh so concerned to match the roof line or the brick pattern of some seedy object next door 

Los Angeles  and London  are surely deserving  of such architecture 

And they need not deserve what they normally get 

We see on the right  uh my own favourite view  of the Imagination building down the street  seen as a kind of glorious almost like a sort of sandhill object in the dusk and my favourite recently seen  Frank Geary building which is a as many of you will know the Schnabel House 

This work  suggests  that architecture  is not achieved  with a po-faced attitude 

But good architecture does not demand a stiff upper lip a nervous twiddling about with window sills

In fact windows may metamorphose into something completely different anyway 

It seems too  that architecture  real architecture  that of optimism and wit  is not the preserve of intense or effete young men and women  

Now somehow my ark shouldn't be like an institution  even perhaps  uh though its stability needs to be assured 

For Cedric Price on the left  or Zaha Hadid on the right  are institutions in themselves  and they studiously these days avoid becoming part of any others 

I can't imagine London 's architectural life without them  just as I can't imagine my ark without them 

Objectively  their work couldn't be more different 

Cedric 's is brilliantly thoughtful  but it 's strategic 

It 's to do with issues 

It 's to do with reduction to essentials 

Yet Zaha 's  is brilliant  with lines 

And it reminds us that line  is the really the dominating force  in architectural action  in the physicality of architectural action 

On the left  the Fun Palace project  was invented in nineteen sixty-one by Cedric Price  together with Joan Littlewood and Gordon Pasque 

It was referred to  in its publicity  as a cybernetic toy 

And it was Reyner Bannon who got it absolutely spot on

He commented in in the press in the in the New Statesman I think  and I can't do his voice  but but I I 'll read it nonetheless  that the architect had been driving architectural journalists mad by steadfastly refusing to release any pictures of what the Fun Palace will actually look like 









But Zaha  had his Eaton Square apartment for that it is if you could discern an apartment somewhere within that marvellous drawing

It 's basically a conversion job on the top of a London terraced house 

And it 's also from a completely different direction  it it deliberately set to destroy  the comfortable myth of everything sitting  nicely orthogonally four-squarely in its place 

And so it is that  very fundamental strategy I I think that links them 

These two images say it all

the one on the left from the  magazine Archegram that we put together

That was a

It c it could still be published today and wou would need to be adjusted very little

There is whizzing Price whizzing around whizzing full of ideas full of strategies 

These  say  that the energy  Price gives out to the world at large  is is enormous

And also very much in parallel was the energy and hope  that was given out to young architects not just in this country but all over the world particularly girl architects  when a very important competition the Peak was won in eighty-three with this extraordinary  free and and  knowing piece of architecture 

Really good architects  have no trouble in operating at the edge  whether as in the Potteries  belt  on my left here  uh of Cedric  it is marginal land  and the marginal condition  that then becomes the strength of the idea such as here the idea of putting  the university  on a railway  and on railway land  or the stimulus  in Zaha 's thin wall project for Berlin 

stimulus of a four metre wide sliver of a site which most people would be completely flummoxed by actually becoming a positive  positive  force to make such a a a perfected piece  facing  what I always think of as Europe 's most exotic street the Kurf&uumlaut;rstendamm 

He designed a torsion apparatus to measure the friction  excuse me  and found some most surprising results

For example for copper sliding over copper

the friction was at first increased by the passage of current

But after repeating the experiment a few times the friction was decreased with the passage of current 

For graphite sliding on graphite  current flow always reduced the friction

But for the case of real practical importance copper sliding on graphite current flow decreased the friction even more

and nature is not always so kind 

This work was written up in the Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers with a thoroughness which at this early stage in Harold 's career is extremely impressive 

When the P H D work was over he thought he was duty bound to join his father 's firm 

He was at once involved in getting out tenders interviewing clients and sometimes doing the wiring and installation work himself 

He wasn't entirely happy in this work

He really wanted to get back to something more scientific

And then as we 've heard the uh offer came from Fleming of a post here at U C L 

He later regarded this decision to accept the offer as the most crucial decision in his entire career 

There was little time for research and there were few research students 

But Harold greatly enjoyed his teaching work

On Fleming 's retirement Clinton was appointed to the Pender chair and was succeeded in his turn by Professor R O Kapp

that Professor Barlow uh uh in the film just spoke about

Kapp was a very distinguished power engineer

His ideal engineer was a consulting engineer and a good committee man

His interest was not  particularly in research

but he was very sympathetic to what Harold Barlow was doing in the Department building up the research activities 

And he he really was Kapp was really a most charming man

And he was in fact the Pender Professor for a few years when I first came to U C L in May nineteen forty-six

and I was present at the retirement party given to Kapp when somebody in one of the speeches after the dinner said that in fact Professor Kapp was the only professor in the University of London who looked like a professor 

Harold published eleven research papers in the period from nineteen twenty-four to nineteen thirty-nine 

Four of these were related to power engineering topics  three to measurements  and the remaining four to the validity of Ohm 's Law

It 's obviously impossible to do justice to all of these while leaving time to describe some of the later work

so I 'll simply mention one or two 

May I have the first slide please 

The first published evidence of Ha Harold 's inventive ability appears in his invention of the valve ammeter

The valvometer was already a known device

The measurement of current of radio frequencies in the nineteen thirties was usually done by thermocouple and a galvanometer 

This system had two severe disadvantages 

The thermocouple was easily burnt out and  the uh uh response was usually rather slow

Both of these drawbacks were alleviated in the new instrument 

The principle was very ingenious

The radio frequency current was passed through the filament it was a a directly heated filament here uhm superimposed on a larger direct current which provided the main heating 

The anode voltage applied was sufficient to ensure that the anode current was limited by the filament temperature

It was therefore very sensitive to any change in this caused by the added radio frequency current

This change unbalanced the bridge

and the galvanometer G in the diagram could be calibrated directly in terms of radio frequency current 

This graph shows that the instrument worked well up to five megaHertz

An important aspect of this work is that it attracted the attention of industry for G E C and Tinsley both supported it

It also attracted great industrial interest in a a discussion at the I E E after Harold Barlow presented a paper on on the subject 

From the earliest days all of Harold 's work started one of two things

It either leant towards useful device or it produced fundamental knowledge

And the next thing I 'm going to talk about is in the second category  the work on Ohm 's Law 

This shows the the very complicated bridge which Harold used to test the validity of Ohm 's Law 

A scientist named Bridgeman claimed to have shown that there was a deviation from Ohm 's Law at very high current densities and this was measured in gold at current densities of the order of a million amperes per square centimetre

Earlier experiments by Harold had suggested that when heating effects were taken into account Ohm 's Law was valid

But characteristically since some doubt remained in his mind he repeated the work with the greatly improved apparatus shown here

The principle was once again to superimpose a radio frequency current on a much larger direct current and to measure the the the radio frequency resistance of the gold leaf as the direct current was varied 

The result of this very careful series of measurements is shown on the next on this graph

The uh this shows a definite increase in resistance as the current uh increases

The the current is written on the horizontal axis and you may not be able to read the figures but the extreme right figure is six million amperes per square centimetre and at the on this scale the top goes up to point one six uh of an ohm

So a a very distinct increase uh in the resistance

But he wasn't able completely to remove the heating effect so he did a rather ingenious thing

He set up an independent heater so that he could independently control the temperature of the gold leaf uh and the the current through it

And in this way he established that there was uhm a a definite effect uh of as it were saturation as the uh as the current increased 

The incidentally the uhm the way he got a million amperes per square centimetre was to uhm to take the gold leaf and beat it down to uh a thickness of five millionths of a centimetre in thickness cut un under a microscope with a razor blade to the required width

And it takes a good experimenter to do that

You then only need a few milliamps to get the current of six million amperes per square centimetre 

The last paper which Harold published before the Second World War appeared in the journal of the I E E in August nineteen thirty-nine

It was entitled The Electrical Protection of Cold Cathode Luminous Discharge Tube Installations or in everyday language neon signs

In the form shown here the system offered protection against open circuit and short faults 

It offered many advantages over other systems including rapid action

May I have the lights please 

This was demonstrated to me when when I first joined Harold at U C L in nineteen forty-six 

It was a rather alarming demonstration

He first switched on a large fluorescent tube to which the protection system had had been attached

He then took a rag and soaked it in petrol

After a brief unworthy glance at the door I courageously stood my ground while Harold calmly dropped the rag on one of the terminals

The light went out instantly and the fierce conflagration I half expected didn't take place 

The demonstration was a complete success

The system was in fact patented and put into commercial operation

It 's interesting to read at the end of Harold 's paper on the subject the following



In fact Harold and his father set up a company Neon Safety Devices Limited to exploit the invention

Harold 's research contributions had by now been recognised by the University of London by his promotion to a readership

And in the industrial world his inventiveness and his interest in practical application was widely recognised 

But his career was now about to make an abrupt transition 

War seeming close Harold and many other high-flying academics were selected by Sir John Cockcroft to make themselves familiar with radar 

He was in a group which included J A Ratcliff and R A Smith both of whom along with Harold later became Fellows of the Royal Society 

They assembled early in August nineteen thirty-nine in great secrecy at the White Hart Hotel in Halesworth Suffolk

When war was declared Harold was posted to several different establishments before arriving in nineteen forty at R A E Farnborough where he remained until he was released from his wartime duties in nineteen forty-five 

By that time he 'd been a appointed superintendent of the radio department 

I 've already mentioned my first encounter with Harold or Doctor Barlow as of course we all thought of him at that time 

Soon after that another example of his interest in his staff occurred

I was working in the lab on a simple piece of test equipment I 'd designed and he came in and asked me some questions about it in a very friendly way

I assumed that I must 've come through the questioning satisfactorily for soon after that my salary was raised from a hundred and sixty pounds a year to two hundred and ten pounds a year 

My next encounter was when I proposed a a scheme for merchant seamen to detect the presence of aircraft in the neighbourhood based on the Doppler Effect 

Harold was sufficiently interested to discuss it with me although the scheme was not really very useful 

Later I was surprised to be consulted by him on a scheme of his own an entirely original scheme for electronic scanning

This was in nineteen forty or nineteen forty-one and I I don't know of any other electronic scanning scheme current at that time

It was never published but in the course of preparing this lecture I remembered it well enough to reproduce the theory 

Thank you very much 

Uhm the the idea was to take three die-holes and set them a hundred and twenty degrees apart  and those are the functions F one F two and F three

And a particular point of the whole calculation is that the sum of those is zero and Harold of course knew that from his knowledge of electrical rotating machinery the three phase induction motor uhm uh being the prime example of what he must have had in mind in in thinking this 

The  next trick was to  put into each of these die-holes uhm the currents which are down at the bottom there I one I two and I three which were currents at a radio frequency omega modulated at a modulation frequency P

And these in turn had phase shifts progressively of a hundred and twenty degrees 

Now the  when you the next thing you have to do is to multiply that F one oblique by the I one the F two by the I two the F three by the I three and add them all together

And when all the smoke has cleared away  what you finally get is that

Everything cancels out beautifully except the thing you want

And what that represents of course the bottom line is the radio frequency signal uhm uhm the frequency omega uhm with a a figure of eight uh radiation pattern which is rotating at the frequency P

So it 's a lovely scheme

Uh whether anything like it was was ever used I don't know but I don't think that Harold himself pursued it

No doubt it was locked away in a drawer at R A E uh uh the the day he left 

The scheme wasn't immediately applicable to to radar and and for that reason it wasn't uh pursued at the time

But in any case Harold 's new responsibilities as superintendent of the radio department soon became so heavy that he really had no time for personal research even on the the theoretical side and he felt increasingly out of touch with the latest developments 

I 've given the title  to this lecture of The Immunological Compact Disc 

And I 've chosen that terminology partly because it constitutes  the sort of buzz word that might attract attention of a much wider public and secondly because the technology that we 're developing does resemble in very close  detail the technology which we find in the conventional music  reading compact disc

And what it is really designed to do  is to enable us to measure  as many substances of biological interest in a sample as we could want

And if we 're successful in developing such a such a technology I personally believe it will transform medical diagnosis  and many other areas where it 's necessary to measure various low concentrations  of biological infrastructures for example in the food industry and in environmental studies and other suitable areas

Not only would it do that

but hopefully it will  help to rescue University College from  its financial embarrassments at the present time

In other words  it 's a technology which I think uh relates to an area of great commercial interest

and uh hopefully we can capture some of the worldwide market that that uh uh centres on this particular field 

Now by way of self-introduction I 'm a physicist by trade  and I work in the Department of Molecular Endocrinology 

And in fact the principal area of academic interest uh in the department centres on the studies on the development of the human brain particularly the human foetal brain and uhm  the effect of maternal hormones particularly in early pregnancy on that development

And I think this is an extremely important area relating development of intelligence on personalities on left and right handedness and many other things that uh are of great interest

But if one 's working any area of particular research of this kind one obviously needs techniques  such as for example the techniques of molecular biology  and other similar uh techniques which of that kind 

But many uh of course one of the most important techniques that anyone working in the area of endocrinology requires is the ability to measure  hormones

And I 'm going to start off by briefly overviewing  uhm what we have done over the course of the last thirty years or thirty-five years uhm i i with the intention of developing technologies to enable us to measure hormones 

Uhm and by so doing I hope it will uh I can touch on some of the basic concepts that underlie uh our attempts to do that coupled with the the basic concepts underlying the immunological compact disc

But of course in attempting to measure hormones of course the technology which has been evolved to do that has now been used to measure substances of biological importance in many other areas of medicine

So it 's of general interest not only to endocrinologists

Now I 'm I 'm  be introduced so I can just show up the first slide which is merely the title of the lecture

Can I

I 'll press this

We apparently need now to dim the lights

Can we do that

It 's uh  a way so that you can actually see the slides 

Is that all  to you all

OK 

So that 's what we 're talking about

And I 'm now going to go back  to the situation of some thirty years ago or more when in fact we were faced with the problem of measuring  uh hormones in biological fluids

Now uhm  to put this into context I 've indicated here on the left-hand side a a scale of concentrations of one or two common substances in a s in a biological fluid such as blood

We could go from uh ten to the zero up to ten to the nineteenth molecules per millilitre of a biological fluid such as blood

And I 've only put very few substances on there

Have you noticed just as a matter of interest that uhm  when you 've had a decent meal  and you 've drunk half a bottle of wine you will have something to the order of ten to the eighteenth molecules per millilitre of alcohol in your blood

The legal limit is in the order of ten to the nineteenth molecules per millilitre 

Now thirty years ago in nineteen round about the late fifties and early sixties  we were unable to penetrate into the range of concentrations down to your ten to the fourteenth down to the seventh down to ten to the seventh which is the range which subsequently we have discovered the range of concentrations where many of the hormones uh exist

These methods may mean very little to you 

But by way of illustration of what they do mean if you can imagine sitting  or standing by the side of an Olympic swimming pool and taking the smallest pinch of salt that you can imagine something of the order of one milligram and dropping into the water the concentration of sodium chloride in the water will be in the order of ten to the tenth molecules per millilitre which is a greater number of molecules than the entire world population albeit at an extremely low dilution

So it gives you some idea of the analytical challenge with which we were faced thirty years ago in trying to measure concentrations of hormones in blood 

To say that we couldn't do it isn't entirely true

There was a technology which was being developed in this in I say this medical school meaning Middlesex because this is where I I hail from uh by Professor Tate and his colleagues who went to one-phrase and this was the sort of technology which they had at the time which was take a substance

I 've shown you an amino acid reacting with another substance which would be a radio-labelled uh reagent

I 've shown it here as pipsichloride

I didn't couldn't give it it 's one of many reagents to form a radioactive derivative

But of course how much radioactive derivative one  uh formed was indicative of how much of the original substance there was in the in the sample

But of course one prepared many other radioactive derivatives at the same time

And the problem was to isolate this particular derivative from all the others

And to do that one added uh the same material the same derivative but labelled with a different label radioactive label  mixed them together and then put them through a long extraction and purification procedure

And by measuring the ratio of the two labels one derived by a simple formula how much of this original substance was present

OK

If you I won't leave the slide on for long

but you 've only got to look at this outline

and you will see in principle at least it 's a simple method of measuring of uh a low concentration of the substance

The problem was  that this procedure of extracting and purification took countless steps and occupied about a week so that the amount of labour involved in measuring a substance a steroid for instance would be enormous

Now we used to cogitate about this sometimes

And one day going home at night I thought of this general principle which is I 've tried to illustrate on this slide

A very simple concept

That is if you take this substance which you want to measure and react it with a protein

Now proteins in general are very specific in their binding point

and so if you react the substance with a protein in such relative proportions that after reaction there 'd be some of the substance bound to the protein and some of the substance left over you could deduce how much of the substance the analyte so-called  that was originally present by the distribution of the analyte between the two fractions following reaction

How can you observe that distribution

by adding a radio-label to the mixture the same substance radio-labelled so you can observe the distribution of the radio-label between the two

moieties

A very simple idea which any child can understand like pouring water into a cup and seeing how much overflows from which you can deduce how much water you started with 

OK

Now needless to say  being innocent of my biochemical career many other people said it wouldn't work

But to my concern for some years actually doing it was delayed for  reasons

Eventually

This is a slide dating from  fifty-nine as a matter of fact

It shows just shows how the technology of  has changed in thirty years

And this is the same mili som uh concept put in slightly more formal terms

Here 's the compound

We add a radioactive the same compound radio-labelled to the mixture

Extract it if we need and add to a second compound which I call compound Q which can be a protein or antibody what you will anything which is specific in its reaction

And by observing the distribution of the label one could deduce how much compound P was present 

And little did I know when I presented that at a research society in nineteen fifty-nine it would win a Nobel Prize unfortunately not for me

It would also create an industry worth currently worth about five million dollars per annum 

Some people call this a competitive system because they visualize it as here 's a binding agent and here are molecules out here which are unlabelled some are labelled and they compete for the binding sites

So that 's uh historical background for the term competitive which is often used for this sort of approach

This was how it  when we first used it for the measurement of thyroxin

Here 's thyroxin  reactive radioactive thyroxin

Label it

Extract it

Add it to a specific serum which contains s specific binding protein

Separate the two electrophoretically because again this slide dates back to nineteen fifty-nine

so the ratio of these contractions will give an estimate of how much thyroxin is present

And this is actually some of the old stuff which was my P H D thes thesis showing how the distribution between the the specifically bound and the quotes free depended on how much thyroxin was added

There 's a small amount

There 's a large amount

So the distribution of these two fractions becomes a measure of how much thyroxin is in the system

OK 

This takes us back thirty years

And what this technology did 

Incidentally at the time I published the thyroxin essay Burt and Galloway in the States published a similar procedure exactly identical for the measurement of the insulin seroglycerin using an antibody as the binding agent

So the thing was done basically at a similar time in New York and in this institution

Now what that did was to open up a range of concentrations lying between ten to the fourteenth and down to about ten to the seventh which is we b b

at last we 're able to see hormones in blood in relation to their concentrations

But of course we 've had a revolutionary impact upon endocrinology 

Of course there are many other substances whose  I 'll describe in a moment

Concentrations of substances below ten to the seventh cannot be measured using these radioactive-based methodologies

I should indicate by the way that the methodology when you use a radio-label and an antibody as a binding agent is known in the trade as 

but there 's an alternative methodology when you label the antibody with a radioactive label

and that is known in the trade as 

But for reasons that I might touch on in a in a moment these techniques whether you label one or the other will not penetrate below ten to the seventh

Now of course it 's this particular range which is particularly important for example in virology because it 's no good running around with ten to the fifth molecules of uh AIDS virus in your blood and thinking you haven't got any there

So you need technologies for getting down into that region

Sensitivity in other words was the name of the game

That is why we developed  techniques  in order to measure very low concentrations of substances

There was actually however a lot of  dispute round about this period as to how to actually extract the greatest sensitivity out of one 's methodology

And the dispute lay between both Indiana on one side of the Atlantic and myself on the other

And the great dissent was on what we meant by sensitivity

Now this is a problem that lies throughout science

It 's not confined to this particular area because people do have not understood what they meant by what they mean by a sensitive technique

And I 've tried to encapsulate the argument in this slide here

Forget about the bottom bit

This is about sensitivity

If you have two methodologies in any area of science when you have a response and a quotes dose that means a concentration or amount of a substance and you have a methodology A which gives you that dose response curve shown here and that methodology B which gives you that dose response curve in many

many formal definitions of sensitivity would suggest that methodology A is the more sensitive 

And this this this definition of sensitivity has been applied by American Chemical Society the British Chemical Institute etc etc

It is nonsensical 

In other words you will reach the conclusion that sensitiv methodology A is more sensitive because it gives you the steeper dose response curve so-called 

Whereas  I and my colleagues have subsequently strongly argued that sens that  what we mean by sensitivity is the precision with which we measure nothing in other words the detection limit of any methodology whether it be a radio set a balance and even diagnostic methodology or what you will

So the sys the system B is the more sensitive because it enables you to measure a smaller concentration rather than that the detection limit is lower

But what I 'd like to talk to you about uh this afternoon just uh briefly because we only have forty-five minutes is uh studying climate change from space

And my talk will split into four uhm sections

I 'll spend a few minutes talking about the climate system 

And uh then having sort of looked at that we 'll ask the question and hopefully answer it uh why observe from space 

There are many parts of the climate system that we could discuss uhm

but uh I thought I would concentrate on polar ice

and any of you who saw I T V 's News at Ten last night uh will have will have a foretaste of at least one of the things that I uh will address 

And then I 'll say a few words about where do we go next uh what 's going to happen in the future 

So we 'll start with what is the climate system 

Now that 's uh a view from space of the earth 

Uhm what you might notice about uh this image is that it doesn't show the surface 

And in fact if we had eyes that we could tune to any part of the uh spectrum uh from radio waves through infrared to optical and X-rays and so on

Most of the time that 's the sort of view we would see of the earth

That is we would not be able to see down through the atmosphere towards the uh to the surface

It 's only in very narrow bands that we can actually see down to the surface in visible and in the radio and in a few special little places in the infrared 

Now this is and I 'll come back to that in a minute 

Now this is actually a what you might call a heat image

It 's a made with a similar sort of apparatus to uh the apparatus that firemen use to find uh bodies trapped in rubble something that 's sensitive to the heat that 's being emitted 

And so what you can see is that there 's uh and indeed the the blackness indicates the amount of energy that 's reaching this camera

So what you can see is there 's quite a lot of heat making its way up from the clear parts of the atmosphere

I say clear

we can't actually see down to the surface in this wavelength but there 's a lot of heat leaking out of there

There 's some heat leaking away from the tops of the clouds

and if this photograph had sufficient uh range of contrast you would see that the clouds are still quite a lot hotter than the background of space

In fact the background of space is pretty close to the zero of the absolute temperature scale so that 's pretty cold

So what this image tells us is that there 's heat being lost from the earth in an uneven sort of manner 

Uhm and of course if that were all if the earth just existed in space on its own if there were nothing else there then this loss of heat would pretty soon lead to its reaching a very cold temperature like the temperature of space uhm oh about four degrees Kelvin

So there 's something that present prevents the earth from doing that and of course that 's our  uh our neighbour the sun

And uh I was until a few years ago an astronomer

so I like to see the earth in its astronomical context

and this will do for me

Uhm let 's just go back to this sort of concept we 've just been looking at

We have the earth

And it 's it 's losing heat 

And I 've drawn these arrows as if it 's losing heat uniformly in all directions but we saw that wasn't really true

And so now we add to it the sun uh which is of course some distance away but very hot

And the earth continually intercepts heat from the sun

Uhm those two uh processes the interception of heat from the sun and the loss of heat to space are exactly in balance

If they weren't in balance then the earth would heat up or cool down

And it 's been pretty much at the same temperature for a long time

So it 's found its equilibrium and it 's radiating away just the amount of heat that it receives from the sun

It does reflect away some heat from the sun as well and we 'll we 'll ignore that 

So uh you might wonder what this has got to do with climate

Well well climate is just a little transient part if you like in this process because the heat that comes in from the sun is retained by the earth for a while before it 's radiated away

and it 's retained by the fluids on its surface that is the oceans and the atmosphere which transport that heat around the surface of the earth and are indeed driven by the energy uhm which is received from that if you like

So the climate system as we know it that 's as little biological entities wandering around on the surface here

the climate system we experience is all to do with this borrowed heat this transient heat that has come from the sun and will shortly be radiated away into space 

Now I 've used a little colour coding on here

Where we 've got  light which is the main form of energy heat coming in from the sun I 've I 've just edged the arrows in yellow

And where the heat is going away from the earth I 've edged it in red

And our first uh uh view from a satellite of what 's going on will be a summary of the heat income and heat uh losses which have been measured by satellites orbiting the earth and averaging over the seasons

And so I 'm not going to show you many graphs

but I 'm going to show you this one because it 's it 's important

and it actually summarises quite a lot of what 's going on

So that what we 've got here is a plot of the heat that is received averaged over the year uhm at a particular latitude

So here now is the equator

Not surprisingly we get uhm the bulk of the heat coming in from the sun

That 's what this yellow curve is about

There are a few humps and bumps on here which is all to do with cloudiness and clouds reflecting where heat 's gone

but basically the peak input is round about the equator which is what you might expect

That 's the part of the earth that faces the sun

And then it falls away almost down to zero at the North and South Poles

Not quite to zero because we 're averaging over the year and you know that the earth 's axis is very slightly tilted so you get a a a summer at the North Pole for part of the year and a winter uh in darkness

But you do collect some heat light energy up there 

So that 's that 's the income

If we if we look at the area under this curve that 's the total energy that we gain from the sun in a year 

Uhm the red line on the other hand shows heat going back out away from the earth into space the other half of this uh balanced process

But of course the areas under the curve are exactly the same

If they weren't it would imply that the earth were warming up or cooling down which it isn't

But you 'll see that the distribution is different

That is there 's more heat lost from the poles than is gained directly from the sun

And in fact there 's less heat radiated at the equator than is gained from the sun

And that 's because the atmosphere and the oceans are redistributing this heat towards the poles 

Now we 've got fairly good uhm atmospheric models

And this is a a complicated diagram but I just show it to illustrate that we believe that we understand quite well how the atmosphere behaves

These are motions and heat transports in the atmosphere which people model and fit to uhm observations from meteorological satellites and so on

And we believe that we understand reasonably well how the atmosphere transports heat towards the poles

Uhm we believe that we can account for half of the energy transport that that previous uh set of measurements uh show takes place by motions in the atmosphere

And so that leaves the other half of that heat transfer uhm to be accounted for by the oceans

And this is a very general uh sort of picture of what we believe is going on

That is heat that 's collected in the equatorial Pacific the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic is transported round by the ocean currents uhm

the heat is held within the ocean for some time and ultimately distributed uh to higher latitudes than would otherwise be the case

Note that an awful lot of heat gets gathered round the world and passed up in our uhm neck of the woods which keeps our climate mu much milder than it would otherwise be 

Now I c I could talk a lot about the oceans and the atmosphere because these 're clearly important elements in the climate system

but you 'll notice that the top and bottom of this uh plot are the the North and South Pole

and these are the heat sinks of our little uh heat engine that 's driving these motions

Now those heat sinks are particularly interesting 

But before we get on to those let 's just consider one other aspect of the climate system 

That is when this energy comes in from the sun it comes in as visible light 

And so this little diagram shows uh light rays coming down from the sun

Some of them are reflected away from the clouds in the upper atmosphere

That 's uh ten fifteen per cent go that way and and a similar amount is reflected away from the surface

And of course at these uh at these wavelengths invisible black can escape quite regularly

So about thirty per cent in total gets lost

and other than the fact that the atmosphere looks a bit hazy you can in the visible wavelengths see clearly down to the atmosphere 

Now that warms up the surface

and so the rest of the heat that 's got to get to back out into space to balance this uh process uhm has to get away as heat energy

And you 'll remember that in that first photograph I showed uhm it was clear that most of that heat escaped from between the cloudy areas and it was emitted by the other parts of the atmosphere because at these wavelengths the atmosphere is OK 

So the energy that 's trying to get away from the surface has to make its way up through those opaque layers of the atmosphere by being emitted and and re-absorbed re-emitted re-absorbed

Ultimately it gets high enough to the point where it can escape and escape out into into space and balance this uh engine uhm equation 

Now trying to drive heat across what is effectively a poor conductor

I i i it 's not a true analogy but you can think of it that way

To drive that heat across this atmosphere you need a temperature difference

And the more opaque that atmosphere is the less conductive it is the bigger the temperature difference you need to cross it 

Now there are physical laws that say how much heat will be radiated away from the top of this atmosphere and that depends purely on its temperature 

So if the temperature of the up upper atmosphere is fixed then if the atmosphere changes in its properties then you have to change the surface temperature to drive more or less heat across it uh sorry to drive the same amount of heat across it uh as its conductivity varies 

And in fact there 's a a forty degree centigrade drop between the surface of the earth and the upper areas of the atmosphere that radiate away this heat

and that 's known as the Natural Greenhouse Effect

You all know how uhm tomatoes are made to ripen in greenhouses

You get the light into the greenhouse but the thermal radiation can't get back out through the glass

Very similar uh process going on here

And so there 's a Natural Greenhouse Effect which is really useful to us because if it weren't there then the surface of the earth would be at about two hundred and fifty or two hundred and sixty degrees absolute

that 's uh say fifteen degrees below the freezing point of water

and the whole of the surface of the earth would be frozen over

So it 's to our advantage that the Greenhouse Effect exists 

So let 's just backtrack a second 

What I 've talked about is uh the following

Heating comes from the sun

It 's balanced by the heat loss to space and it and it 's an extremely good balance 

In transit the heat is redistributed from the equator towards the poles by the ocean and the atmosphere and the polar regions act as the heat sink for the climate system

so from the point of view of driving these fluids uh how that heat sink behaves is important 

And I 've said that there is a Natural Greenhouse Effect which results in about a forty degree centigrade temperature drop between the surface of the earth and the upper part of the atmosphere that actually radiates away the heat 

Now this curve uhm is one that uhm has caused some concern uh over the last decade or so

And what this curve shows is the percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

Actually measured uhm on Hawaii which is a long way away from any industrial areas that might cause local variation

so it 's a well-mixed atmosphere

And this is a measure of art 's dominion uhm

And so it 's a sort of News at Ten graph because it 's offset a lot because the zeroes are a long way down below the level of the floor

But nevertheless it shows that there 's been a systematic continuous increase uh over the last thirty forty years

And indeed we can actually relate little changes in the gradient of this curve to uhm OPEC oil price hikes and other changes in the world economy

Once upon a time a French guru called Paul Ricoeur visited the University of Warwick

And his legacy was a seminar entitled The Role of Narrative in Culture 

And they started with the obvious disciplines

They started with history and theology

They even had literature and one or two uhm anthropology and one or two others that you might expect to be concerned with story telling

And then they moved to rather less obvious ones such as economics such as philosophy of science such as mathematics even and then eventually the law which I would 've thought would 've been obvious 

Whereas with the first set of disciplines they 'd invited academics to inform on this occasion they approached Lord Denning 

And they wrote to him saying in effect dear Lord Denning you are the greatest legal story teller of your generation

Would you come and tell us your secrets

Lord Denning wrote back to the effect and now I 'll now quote

I am indeed the greatest legal story teller of my generation but I am too old to come to Warwick 

And eventually four of us went down and interviewed Lord Denning in his home

He very graciously received us but that is another story

It wasn't sufficient to replace Lord Denning by one person so they invited two and a half lawyers to  give accounts of story telling in legal discourse

And I was one of them

And like the economist and like the philosopher of science and I suspect like the mathematician and even perhaps the theologian I 'd never thought about story telling in my discipline

I knew that it happened but it wasn't hadn't been a focus of attention

So that 's how I got into this 

Second story

Once upon a time I walked into a law school

It was The New England Law School in Boston and it was just after lunch before I was due to give a public lecture

Two o'clock a rather more civilised time than this 

I 'd had a  reasonable lunch but not that good a lunch

But it was a plate glass Law School and when I picked myself up from the pavement I was concussed and blood was streaming from my nose 

I crawled up to my host 's office lay down on the floor for the five minutes before the lecture managed to at least get my head clear but blood was still was all over my s suit

On my handkerchief I was having to dab my nose all the while I gave my lecture

So I thought the only thing to do is to explain to my audience why I was in that state 

I happened to have a rather difficult subject to sell to a rather unsympathetic audience 

They ate out of my hand

I had never sold a topic more successfully 

A third story

Once upon a time a famous English judge Lord Atkin was involved in one of the what proved to be one of the classic cases of English law 

And he was genuinely worried about the case

Some of you will have heard of it  and Stevenson

And as his daughter reports he posed the black situation to his daughters at breakfast 

And his daughters having heard him tell the facts said

of course the plaintiff should win Daddy

And sure enough the plaintiff won

Later  the daughter writing up about this uhm said that this was Daddy 's practice all along

And I would like to read a little quotation from her memoirs











A fourth story

This is a bedtime story

and I will would you please sit back close your eyes and try and envisage the scene 

Once upon a time Joe went to Sam 's party

Sam blew out the candles 

How many of you envisage do not envisage a birthday cake 

One or two

How many of you thought that Sam was old older than twenty years old 

One 

In fact I tried this with a class the other day and in fact I consider this a success

Uh now 

What is the moral of some of these anecdotes

First of all the Warwick seminar brought out for some people in a number of disciplines including law story telling plays a central role in the discourse of practically every discipline of every kind of discourse

It certainly plays a central role in legal discourse

It 's very rarely been noticed or examined until quite recently

it 's now become quite fashionable 

We now have studies of story telling by judges and advocates

We have many accounts of the difficulties witnesses have in telling their stories in Court particularly under the adversarial system and they are regularly complaining they 're not allowed to tell their stories

We have people from different cultures from different classes when being interviewed by lawyers again complaining of the difficulty of getting their story across of not being heard

We hear a great deal about unheard voices

And we 've had developments in particularly in New Zealand and Canada of for instance the White Hanging trig tribunal in New Zealand which has radically altered its procedure to have different matters of presentation so that alternative voices could be heard 

We have studies by psychologists about how jurors make up their mind suggesting that jurors typically  decide by constructing or testing or testing the alternative the plausibility of alternative stories

And we have a lot of other  studies 

And one of the obvious things is that story telling in as far as the law is concerned arises in a great many different contexts by different people for different purposes

and we can't treat it as a single phenomenon

I want to concentrate on story telling in a familiar context although perhaps less familiar uhm to T V watchers tha than trials or the kind of thing you get in L A Law

there 's a lot of story telling going on there but typically in arguments about questions of fact in arguments about questions of law and arguments about judges

and justifying their decision 's a fairly traditional process 

And there 's a puzzle 

Each of the stories I told you except about Warwick uhm had a function which is a little bit troubling from the traditional legal point of view  although not unfamiliar 

I didn't tell you the subject of my lecture in the law school into which I walked 

I only told you that because I had a bleeding nose I won the sympathy of my audience and persuaded them on the subject of my lecture

My bleeding nose was totally irrelevant to the subject of my lecture 

In the case of Lord Atkin 's daughter  daughters  here is a judge claiming to be puzzled telling the facts of a case in order to raise an issue

and his daughters never have any doubt at all as to which side should win 

Was Lord Atkin cheating 

Was he being an advocate unconsciously

Was he biased in some way

What was his story telling doing

Because it doesn't seem to fit the idea of what a judge should be doing when he is impartially stating the facts before looking at the issue before going on and considering the arguments about some general point of law

And the birthday cake story is even more worrying from a legal point of view 

If by my merely telling you two facts  that Johnny went to Sam 's party and Sam blew out the candles you could fill in with dozens of other facts and without knowing my audience I can be reasonably confident which facts you 'd fill in with if you 're a reasonably culturally homogeneous audience it opens the way for an advocate telling stories to  bring in inadmissible  evidence invent facts or at least suggest facts by innuendo get facts accepted by a jury or  without any evidence  cover the whole situation unseen uhm without ever violating any of the accepted peoples ' norms of the admissibility of evidence the ethics of advocacy or anything else

If you 'd like to look at your handout those of you who 've got it the second  uhm passage Miller and Jackson  is perhaps Lord Denning a bit over the top Lord Denning at his most extreme

It 's the opening paragraph of a judgement about a case about cricket

And the an impartial statement of the  fact situation if that is possible is that it was an action for nuisance concerning the occupants fairly recent occupants of a housing estate who complained about cricket balls coming into their garden from the local cricket pitch

It was in the village of Lintz in county Durham

Now if you read Lord Denning 's opening paragraph in quite an important case he starts off with a lie

In summer time cricket is the delight of everyone

First of all we know that 's not true but this is a case about cricket haters

The Millers hated cricket 

And then he goes on nearly every village has its cricket field

If you read it through you have this picture of cricket in Hampshire

You fill in with old men sitting around the edge with trees green countryside etc

I 'm told that the law students of the University of Durham used I don't know if they still do make an annual pilgrimage to Lintz

This is a world-famous uhm case

Lintz is a mining village

And although I 've not visited myself the cricket ground is surrounded by slag heaps  and the impression of the situation is totally without doubt Denning was telling many lies and inventing many facts

I think that he even invented the phrase the animals did not mind the cricket 

Uhm he he 's actually given  a totally misleading impression of the situation and in fact weakened the case he was trying to make

Having interviewed Lord Denning I can tell you that the background of this case was that surprisingly  most of the sympathy in the Court of Appeal and even of other people who 'd been associated was with the Millers and against the cricket club

And the cricket club was at risk

And Lord Denning went over  board as an advocate in order to right the balance

And there are those of us who feel that perhaps this was going a bit too  obviously overboard in telling the story and setting the situation in a way which favoured the  cricket

But his argument was essentially that cricket was a community activity and here was a conflict between property owners and the community

Only he would 've been much stronger if he 'd presented a picture of cricket in northern England uhm than the kind of nostalgic picture of Hampshire village cricket that he manages to evoke in his misleading statement of the facts 

So we have a puzzle

All the examples I 've given you are examples of story telling which seem to have little to do with rational argument deciding on the evidence deciding on the merits and things like that

They all all seem to be doing  to do with introducing irrelevancies like my bloody nose introducing inadmissible evidence at least by implication creating a false impression and therefore getting people to believe facts on which there 's been absolutely no argument or no evidence at all  winning sympathy or the reverse for perhaps oneself or for an advocate or perhaps for for the authorities  getting people very often to focus on goodies and baddies when one of the  main principles of criminal law is judge the act not the actor

We shouldn't be concerned with the character and disposition of the accused

We should only be concerned with what happened

But as soon as you start to tell a story it is practically impossible not to start to evoke character and so on

And so we 're left with on the one hand the idea that perhaps story telling in the context of advocacy and of judging is in some sense illegitimate

And yet you find that psychological evidence with regard to decisions of the questions of fact

Uhm

this is  research by both psychologists and sociologists suggests that story story construction is a necessary part of forming judgement

Mr Chairman  ladies and gentlemen

Mr Chairman thank you very much indeed for that kind introduction 

My great great grandfather the first Duke was a splendid fellow and it is a delight for me to see you in the chair as he was as you say a founder member of the National Trust

He also had another distinguishing feature 

He was also a leading member of the Temperance Society

Whereas the National Trust I have supported for ever and ever I ca as long as I can remember I fear I haven't taken up his example of the Temperance Society 

In this company I embark on my daunting task with considerable trepidation and a deep feeling of inadequacy

To be confronted by two hundred Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts is somewhat a nerve-racking experience

I 'm sure that you are expecting me to say something stimulating thought-provoking and original

I fear that I may fail you on all three counts 

I have firmly been given a time limit to skate over some nine hundred years of rural ownership and some three hundred years of urban land ownership 

However  dukes as they say are mus much oft misunderstood people

In fact we 're about as becoming as rare as the dodo as far as I can see

One of my more elderly contemporaries for elderly contemporaries I have was very accustomed to having his breakfast in bed

And one morning the lady from the village brought in his breakfast and plonked it down in front of him and said

there you are

And the Duke drew himself up to his full height as he could in bed and said my dear girl when you address me you say Your Grace

And she she got down on her hands and knees and said

for what we are about to receive 

However I hope by th by the end of this talk you will not agree with that big red reference book that all dukes are berks 

However I do welcome the opportunity to speak to you on the subject of managing a great estate 

that is the R A S R S A subject not my own because I passionately believe that the landowner both urban and rural has a contribution to make and a responsibility to discharge as much today as fifty or a hundred years ago 

And I feel very fortunate and I mean it that as to be the head of what is considered to be one of the great estates 

It is the urban landowner 's responsibility not only to ensure  proper provision for all sections of the community but also to make a positive contribution to the continuing enhancement of the urban environment 

Similarly it is the rural landowner who must continue to bear responsibility for the livelihood and the vitality of small communities and thus the survival in many respects of the rural way of life avs as we know it today 

The public perception of the landowner managing his estates varies from visions of red-faced aristocrats in hunting gear drinking port over breakfast to a picture of the slick operator managing bed-sits in Earl 's Court through an offshore Panamanian company 

I fear the truth probably lies somewhere in between and is certainly very much less colourful 

Over the last twenty-five years the management of the Grosvenor estate has become a sophisticated and professional business 

My forebears would probably have difficulty in recognising the estate  today compared with that of a hundred years ago  although I would hope that the inevitable process of change we have not lost all the trappings of the traditional landowner 

I can of course only speak from my own experience with my own estate  which has been my stable since leaving school 

but I suspect we are not alone in introducing fairly substantial changes over recent years 

I thought I would embark upon my task by outlining the nature the structure and organisation we have today before moving on to more detailed description of the component parts highlighting the management principles by which we operate 

Then in conclusion I will seek to bring these principles together as an indication of the Grosvenor philosophy towards land management in its broadest sense 

So first the nature and structure and organisation of the estate 

The estate is a series of trusts the principal beneficiaries of which are the Grosvenor family and a substantial charitable foundation 

Although I and my fellow five trustees in various permutations are responsible for some thirty trusts the single entity concept is a fundamental principle in the management of our assets 

My fellow trustees come from a variety of professional backgrounds and include two bankers a lawyer and two chartered surveyors one of whom is the executive trustee or rather full-time trustee or managing director equivalent 

We meet monthly when we review our activities worldwide concentrating in depth each month on one particular area of activity so that at the end of the twelve month period the senior management of each activity has had the benefit of a face to face review of their proprieties 

Some assets principally the agricultural estates are owned directly by the trustees and here more traditional ways of management remain 

Our urban property essentially the London estate together with various trading and investment activities both in the United Kingdom and overseas are held in a form through a U K holding company

Grosvenor Estates Holdings was formed in nineteen seventy-nine and the six trustees are joined as directors on the main board by four of our senior executives 

Grosvenor Estate Holdings has four principal divisions

The investment division contains the London estate com companies which manage Mayfair Belgravia and Eaton Square 

The developmental trading division which comprises our U K property development company Grosvenor Developments 

The international develop division with our related company Grosvenor International which is based in Vancouver operates in North America and Australia 

And finally we have what we call the Chester group of companies  a range of corporate activities which are the inevitable attachments of land ownership on a significant scale  a hotel company  a farming company a garden centre and an insurance management business 

The subsidiary companies in these four divisions report to the main Grosvenor Estates holding board each month in much the same way that I believe you would find at any large commercial group 

The challenge for us over the past tens ten years has been to reorganise the estate in a corporate form internally without the outward public perception of a traditional landed estate being lost entirely 

We try very hard

and we go to great lengths despite the commercial pressures to do otherwise to retain the long-standing traditions of the urban landowner rather than adopt those of just another property company 

The nature and quality of our assets are r are of course a significant help in this regard as has ably been pointed out by the chairman 

Responsibility for the architecture of Mayfair and Belgravia  its squares streets and private mewses coupled with its property stewardship mean that we directly employ evaluation and building surveyors clerks of works caretakers cleaners maintenance engineers traffic wardens a dozen gardens uh gardeners and even a couple of mi mews sweepers  all put in together to provide a fully integrated and comprehensive land and property management service 

Similarly on the rural estates we employ forestry workers building tradesmen security men apart from those who work on the farms and in the hotel garden centre 

In the U K development company which develops long traditionally owned Grosvenor land in competition with other development companies we call upon in-house a full range of professional development skills and directly appointed shopping centre managers maintenance men plant engineers and cleaners 

In our property development and investment business overseas Grosvenor International employs some eighty-five people with offices in Vancouver San Francisco Washington Honolulu and Sydney

And you will see from that geographic spread that I only orn open offices in places I like to go 

Originally Grosvenor International was largely staffed by expatriates sent out from the United Kingdom 

And while some of the senior executives still remain from those early days we now find it more effective to recruit locally 

Inevitably  a complex and en varied business enterprise like the estate requires strong financial control and we pride ourselves on the quality of our financial management

At times therefore we seem to be overrun with bean counters

and a hundred and fifty or more of our staff are involved with that side of the business 

In all across the world we employ directly some six hundred and fifty people in our various activities including and Jimmy 's put this in fifty chartered surveyors 

The ultimate trustee nature of our ownership means that we are inclined to be cautious in our policies and conservative in our approach to new activities  tending to stick to the things that we think we know something about 

Basically we avoid too much risk although I believe that as we have demonstrated over the past twenty years this does not mean that growth and expansion cannot play an important part in our strategy 

Having given you a brief outline of the scope of our interests and the way we are structured I wonder if I might now turn in more detail to the traditional examples of land management  the London estate and the rural estates since they inevitably set the tone for all our activities and it is from these that we draw our principles and our philosophy 

What makes the Grosvenor Estate different from many other great estates 

It is this unique combination of both rural and urban holdings  that

so virtually all aspects of land management exist under one umbrella 

We have every grade of listed building that is ever conceived

We have a whole strata of higher and low rental housing 

We have conservation areas

We have areas of outstanding natural beauty 

We have less favoured areas 

We have sites of specic special scientific interest 

We have sites that are environmentally sensitive areas 

We have grade one grade two agricultural land

In fact out of every single listing that is possible the only one that we don't have is a World Heritage site  and in fact we 're darn near to one of those as well in Scotland 

However turning to the London estate our London estate is of course the fulcrum around which our Grosvenor Estate res revolves 

This is the cash generator  an asset base  which to some extent supports our activities in both the north-west of England and Scotland 

Our London estate falls into two distinct areas Mayfair with some hundred acres and Belgravia which is approximately twice the size 

Firstly looking at Mayfair 

Mayfair came into the family ownership as a result of a fortuitous marriage in sixteen seventy-seven something which I wasn't able to achieve myself a marriage of Sir Thomas Grosvenor to Mary Davis the daughter of a farmer in the Five Fields of Mayfair

Not probably known she was only twelve at the time 

and even less commonly known that  we outbid the Lord Berkeley of Berkeley Square fame at that time for her hand 

However I digress 

At that time Mayfair was a modest farm well removed from the cramped and crowded conditions of the walled City of London

and for those of you know of the history of Mayfair you will know that they had a May fair there and all sorts of curious activities took place none of which I would go into in such a distinguished audience as this 

However in the seventeen twenties as people became increasingly fed up with the overcrowded and insanitary conditions of the City they sought to live in rather more attractive and pleasant atmosphere of Mayfair 

Always fashionable Mayfair 's heyday was probably at the turn of the century  with London homes of many leading families in Park Lane overlooking Hyde Park 

Dudley House Londonderry House Dorchester House and Grosvenor House 

The London home of Bendor the second Duke of Westminster remained in Park Lane until well after the First World War

Chairman 's already referred to that 

The nineteen thirties saw the beginning of the decline of May Mayfair as London 's prime residential area  hastened by the exodus of offices from the City as a result of the blitz and the granting of temporary office permissions many of which lasted until this year 

Mayfair today is cosmopolitan  a lively mix of offices residential accommodation diplomatic buildings restaurants hotels and shops 

As many companies move their principal offices out of central London we see the growing popularity of Mayfair as an area for headquarter buildings and prestise the prestige accommodation of all kinds 

Turning to Belgravia 

Belgravia was not developed until one hundred years after Mayfair in fact from eighteen twenty-five onwards 

The Prince Regent 's decision to develop Buckingham Palace ensured the area 's popularity with members of the Court of Saint James 

The elegant regency architecture of Belgravia is preverred is preserved to this day although the accommodation as probably many of you know behind the fa&ccedille;ades of say Eaton Square has been adapted to suit the changing needs 

Originally built as houses Eaton Square now has some three hundred and fifty flats

and only six units remain as single houses 

Belgravia as an estate is predominantly residential with offices and commercial property around the perimeter 

The years following the Second World War marked a long period of recovery for the area as many properties had been requisitioned by the authorities and many had suffered war damage

OK

Well I 'm a geologist uhm but I happen to work in a certain branch of geology which is uh micropalaeontology 

Now this involves the study of microscopically small  uh plants and animals

Uhm I look at the the skeletons uh  and try and identify them  down to a species level and then use this information to uh  get uh age or environmental data on uh  on the rocks that I 'm looking at

OK

Well the title of my research is  Mesozoic Radiolarians  from Indonesia

Now this title needs to be explained I suppose

Uh the Mesozoic  is in fact a time slice a geological time slice 

Uh it ranges from  two hundred and forty million years here this red piece uhm to around about  two hundred and ten million years

Now you should be able to stack all of these columns on top of each other

You have the present day at the top here 

Uh

to give you some idea of the age of uh the fossils that I look at 

the dinosaurs died out at the top of the Cretaceous here sixty-five million years ago which is in fact a hundred and eighty million years after the little beasties that I look at died out

Well my study area is Indonesia 

And Indonesia is the largest island archipelago in the world with some seventeen thousand islands 

However I uh  only look at a small group of islands  the islands in the east of Indonesia just to the north of Australia

Now these islands are  in what is called the Banda Arc so I should perhaps explain  uhm the geological setting of these islands

Uhm

they 're all believed to have a very similar geological history whereby they  uhm became detached from Australia about two hundred and fifty million years ago and drifted northwards and have subsequently become deformed  along this plate boundary here  between the Australian plate and the Asian plate 

OK 

This is what 's going on today 

We have Australia being pushed northwards  and uh the Pacific plate being pushed westwards  which is still deforming this group of islands which I study here 

OK

Now the the group of fossils that I study are called radiolarians 

Now these are  very simple single-celled protists

Uhm they 're amoeba-like planktonic animals 

They build uh an internal skeleton of amorphous opaline silica 

And it is this skeleton which us geologists study 

Uh radiolarians have one of the most complete geological records of any fossil group ranging through Phanerozoic time 

Uh they are both planktonic i e living within the water column and benthonic living on the uh substrate  the the sea bed

So uhm various data for instance age and both and environments uhm can be gained by the study of these fossils 

Now why should we use these  particular fossils because there are quite a few different groups

Uhm

radiolarians are present below what is called the C C D which is uh the calcium carbonate compensation depth uhm which is a depth within the ocean  uh whereby calcareous fossils go into dissolution

They 're completely obliterated 

Uhm  they 're commonly found throughout this part of Indonesia this time slice  uh in Indonesia

Uhm they haven't been used before  and they 're they 're rather nice to look at as you 'll see later  I hope 

OK 

We have to go to extraordinary lengths to actually find these fossils

Most of the the work that I do is in the jungles of Indonesia 

And we have to collect our rocks uhm along rivers because that 's where  uhm rocks are exposed

Because of the uh the very rapid weathering and erosion in the jungles  nothing is exposed anywhere else 

So  we hack our way up the rivers and find some rocks 

And uh this is a typical  exposure 

Uh we collect our samples and we get these 

These are radiolarians

To give you some idea of the size  I have three S E M stubs  and there are about thirty-five specimens on each stub

Perhaps if you want to look 

OK

I 'll just quickly show you one or two more 

All very nice very different 

And of course uh the advantage of uh working in the tropics and especially Indonesia is that  you can relax  on the beach afterwards 

To finish up

To summarize  uhm

I use radiolarians  uhm to try and determine the age of these rocks and their geological history  uhm to compla to compare what I find in Indonesia with what is presently found in Australia  uh to set up some sort of uh chart whereby I can date all of the rocks in the area  and chart the geological progress and evolution of this particular island chain 

Thank you

As I said before I 'm trained as a toxicologist  uh toxicology being the study of the effects of chemicals in the body to cause harm 

Toxicology and medical research in general actually are getting a very bad press at the moment

They 're coming under criticism  for using animals uh  in experiments

And my research is actually aimed at trying to find alternatives to using animals  within medical research and particularly toxicology

My particular area is of  expertise  is the skin and uh the toxicological effects of chemicals within the skin 

As you can see from this slide the the skin is a very complex organ

It has a lot of different  cell types within it such as uh connective tissue cells uh lots of cells  involved with uh blood vessels and the blood system  uh  cells that secrete uh sweat 

But the area of interest  for me is the top layer the epidermis of the skin

As far as toxicology is concerned this is im very important because it 's the barrier to the penetration of chemicals into the body itself 

The nice thing about  the epidermis  from my point of view is that it 's basically made up of one cell type and it 's also an avascular structure in other words it has no blood supply 

The cells of the epidermis are referred to as keratinocytes and basically they divide in the bottom layer and then move up  uh to the top layer of the skin 

Uh as they do they change  uh becoming flattened uh losing their nucleus  and forming uh  a very hard layer of keratin

And this is the actual barrier to the penetration of most chemicals particularly chemicals which uh will dissolve in water 

What I 'm trying to do in my research is actually produce a model of the epidermis  in culture 

and what the idea of this will be to replace the use of animals to look at many aspects of skin toxicology

Now I 've just outlined here very quickly some of the areas in which animals are actually used within toxicology 

Uh to look at areas such as drug transport

That 's very important in the pharmaceutical industry because they 're developing uh drugs which will be applied topically in other words to the skin and will be absorbed through the skin and then get to their target organs that way 

It 's also very important of course as far as uh toxic substances as well  whether they can cross this epidermal layer or not 

Also animals are actually used in toxicity testing to look at uh chemical irritation  also photo-irritation

This is where uh the skin will uh  be damaged only after it comes in contact with light and also in contact with a chemical

There 's obviously allergic disorders as well like contact dermatitis that 's the biggest cause of uh industrial complaints  of any type of ailment 

Also photosensitization which is is similar to allergic contact dermatitis except again like photo-irritation it requires the skin to be exposed to light 

Skin cancer is another big area not just uh in toxicity testing but also in uh trying to understand the mechanisms of cancer and therefore develop cures 

Uh and there are also specific skin complaints such as uh psoriasis  as well 

So basically what I 'm tr as I said what I 'm trying to do  is to model  this epidermal layer  in culture 

And then this will actually be used to study  one or more of these  different types of toxicity which I 've shown you 

And just to show how this will actually be of use  in the area of medical research

I don't think there 's time to talk about all those different aspects all those different mechanisms so I 'll just uh refer to the first one drug transport 

Uh the the advantage of a cultured epidermis over conventional animal experiments

Well there 's five main areas

Firstly  cell cultures because they will be isolated from the rest of the body 

They will allow for  much easier  measurement of absorption and metabolism of chemicals 

There 's also the opportunity to study the mechanisms of absorption and metabolism which with a whole animal is actually very difficult to do 

and likewise the the rapid evaluation of strategies for improving drug targeting

again a very important area  in uh the pharmaceutical industry

Actually isolated cell cultures are much more accessible and easy to use than whole animals 

Obviously there 's the opportunity to use human tissue rather than animal tissue because skin is actually quite readily available for most hospitals to use

And lastly uh the industry is very interested obviously because animal experiments are very time-consuming and expensive and time and money are basically all industry is interested in 

But also obviously as I said to start with animal experiments are  quite controversial

and the industry would be very interested to move away from them 

Thank you very much

Sorry

Uhm a slide projector

that 's all 

It 's reasonably well focused but uhm  could probably do with being a bit darker

Can I turn off the lights 

Is that 

Yeah

So  I 'm going to  talk about the research work I 've been doing within the Medical Physics Department for the last uh five six years 

The uhm what we 've been interested in is the uhm  the monitoring of cerebral oxygenation in newborn infants 

Now the  the problem uhm that the clinicians have in caring for newborn infants  is that  they 're aiming to  uhm care for younger and younger infants coming out  after twenty-four or twenty-eight weeks ' gestation 

and what they 're finding is that the  the tech technology that they have available and the expertise that they have can actually maintain these infants uhm  through the difficult period after the birth 

And they 're finding that they get the beneficial effect that more and more healthy babies survive and go through childhood 

But this tends to be at a at a cost

And the cost is that  a number of these infants come through with disabilities of some form 

These disabilities some of them are major and obvious  such as uh quadriplegia

Some of them are rather minor  and not so you know obvious just as such as hearing difficulties

And it takes many years  before  these problems are detected 

Now  where where are the main problems

Well the main problems are  maintaining oxygenation in the in the brain

And what you see here is a premature infant within the neonatal unit in the in the hospital here 

Uhm and you can see uh many monitoring  uh  pieces of equipment around the infant

Uh the infant 's also ventilated

And  during this can go on for many many weeks in fact many months for a very pre-term infant 

And it 's the brain that tends to get  damaged at the end of this period if things don't go well 

So at the medical physics department we were interested  in developing a piece of equipment to try and  measure  uh an adequate oxygen delivery to the brain 

Now  how do we uhm actually  determine  uh oxygen delivery 

Well one of the easiest things to consider is uhm anal analogy with your central heating system  in that  if if the brain just as you in your living room require  a certain amount of heat to be comfortable  the brain requires a certain amount of oxygen

And to deliver that oxygen you need two things 

First of all you need an adequate water temperature as with your boiler  which is the equivalent of how much oxygen  there is leaving the lungs  in the bloodstream 

And the second thing you need is a good flow-round system 

I E you need a good pump to actually  circulate the water around the radiators

And in the case of the infants it 's not in fact  the uhm the pump that 's normally the problem

it 's the fact that it 's difficult to actually get a good flow of blood through the brain because of uhm  uh blockages or haemorrhage or some other problem

I 'm going to talk today uhm a bit about the demography of pastoralists 

Uhm pastoralists are people  who live more or less entirely off animal production  uhm rather than cultivating

Uhm the pastoralists are particularly found in Africa  uhm 

there are a few in in Asia as well 

Uhm

demographically they 're very interesting because very little work has been done on pastoralists  uhm

despite which theories abound  uhm but usually with very very little evidence 

Uhm now why is there  so little dat such little data on pastoralists 

Well one of the reasons is that it 's too difficult to get any

They move  and  you can see from here  they live in that sort of accommodation usually between one and  ten tents uhm per camp and  it takes a long time to find them

When you find them they may not be there

They 're very difficult to find 

uhm

and they move around so that even if you knew they were there once they 're not necessarily going to be there again 

Uhm in one survey I did in six weeks we covered a hundred and eighty different camps  in that sort of terrain 

The other thing is they don't live near roads so you have to have four-wheel drive vehicles to get to them 

Uhm another reason is that because pastoralists tend to be very marginal in the countries in which they live  uhm they are afraid of  the dominant population 

Uhm they 're afraid that they 're going to get taxes out of them money out of them

there 's a sort of certain amount of conflict between them 

There tend to be lan language problems

The pastoralists tend to be linguistically different from the dominant populations 

Uhm and basically they 're just different

Most countries with the one exception of Mauritania uhm  the pastoralists are a minority uhm and the coun country is in general dominated by agriculturalists who have a totally different way of life and who despise the pastoralists because they live in this sort of accommodation 

Uhm and this is actually quite a good quality tent  if you hadn't noticed 

It 's made of leather rather than made of uhm mat

Uhm  and for an agriculturalist this is just uh not how people live

The pastoralists are not people because they don't live in houses and they don't cultivate 

The converse is also true but it has less implications for power 

Uhm  now the countries where  in Africa where most pastoral nomads are found are those countries which are named  on the map 

Uhm  the only one where pastoralists actually dominate the country is Mauritania 

Uhm in all the other countries pastoralists are definitely a minority 

Uhm now I was working in Mali 

And the two green blodges are where our uh actual sample survey sites were that I worked on

Uhm  but basically you 've got a band of of Sahel of semi semi-arid zone along there

And that 's where most pastoralists tend to live partly because they used to live elsewhere but they were pushed out of that area by increasing agricultural populations 

Uhm from Mali you can get some idea of this fact that uhm pastoralists

there 's no demographic data collected 

In nineteen sixty-one sixty-two there was a national demographic survey run by the French  which took a sample from every region in Mali except for the sixth region which is  the whole of this zone up here north of the Niger River and a little bit south of the Niger River where the pastoralists exist  and live

Uhm in the in nineteen eighty-seven there was another national sample survey called the D H S 

By this stage Mali was divided into seven regions

They took an urban and rural sample from all the regions  in the southern area

but in the two northern areas Timbuktu and Gau they only took an urban sample

so no pastoralists were included in the sample  apart from the urban ones

Uhm

even in the census which is a national coverage uhm the methods used for getting data from pastoralists were very poor and only would serve to increase the threat that pastoralists saw from the sedentary agricultural government  uhm because they told them to gather round water holes

and then they would come and count them which is what they usually do when they 're trying to get the numbers and use it for taxes 

Uhm  pastoralists

you get much more localised events

So a woman will say

well

yes

I know my period started the year that Uncle Ahmed got bitten by the snake 

but it doesn't help you to actually identify that particular year 

Uhm

when in in the survey I did in one area  the three dates that we hung our all our data on were an eclipse in nineteen fifty-nine an eclipse in nineteen forty-four and nineteen thirty-two which the  call the year of star wars  in their local language because apparently there were lots of comets in the sky

So we have an enormous amount of women who started menstruating in those three years

Uhm 

Now

So they have rotten dat there 's rotten data on pastoralists

and I suspect that one of the reasons that  those they the uhm cases where low growth rates have been identified is actually because the data was so rotten uhm that they haven't actually got enough of the births  uhm to identify the gen more genuine slightly higher growth rates 

Uhm now why should  if we if we take these ideas of high mortality and low fertility why should pastoralists have higher mortality  or lower fertility than agriculturalists

Uhm  now I 've concentrated mainly on high mortality because the fertility arguments are rather complex and very obscure 

Uhm and as I don't have much time I 'll just look at the mortality factors

Uhm why 

I 've looked at what I 've called positive i e things encouraging pastoralists to have high mortality and negative encouraging them to have low 

One school of thought says they 're nutritionally vulnerable

therefore they 'll have higher mortality  uhm

that they have more seasonal stress than other populations because the season of lowest milk production which is the hot season is also the sign that time of most work uh and most lay uhm energy expenditure 

Uhm they have no access to modern health care

I would not argue with that 

Uhm they 're more exposed to disease through their contact with animals

so they 're more subject to animal-related diseases 

and they have poor water which again I wouldn't argue with 

On the other side though  uhm  they have access to milk and meat  uhm as well as grain

They tend to get their grain by selling milk and meat  whereas most of the agricultural populations are much more dependent on a grain-based diet which is OK  for adults

but if children have a grain-based diet they have to eat so much  to get the s the right amount of energy and protein that often they can't do it whereas if you can get milk or meat into a child 's diet  it 's much more able to uhm  get enough food 

Uhm

in times of stress pastoralists are very mobile

so if there 's a a drought they can get up and move

and agriculturalists can't get up and move in the same way

Uhm 

also another factor which I think is not often taken into account is they have very low population densities

so epidemics go through the population much less regularly than they do through an urban population or uhm a rural village-based population 

And you can see this from measles

In an urban population  in Dakar children by the age of one something like ninety-five per cent had had measles 

In the rural agricultural population village-based by the age of five ninety-five per cent had had measles 

But in pastoral populations you find children of ten even adults who 've never had measles because they 've never been touched by such an epidemic 

Uhm

now the fertility rate the fertility theories range  why pastoralists should have low fertility range from labour needs  through to again seasonal stress

and one guy hypothesises that they have low fertility because of problems induced by camel riding

This is a perfectly serious academic article  but I don't subscribe to it 

Uhm

so the aim of the work that I did was to measure fertility and mortality levels in the   which is the pastoral nomad population in Mali 

Uhm so you can see there 's at least two groups

I did two separate surveys one in an area called the Delta  which is this one which is an inland riverine delta area where the pastoralists go in the hot season  and one in an area called the  which is a traditional Sahelian  zone rather like that first slide you saw 

Uhm  now this population is uhm  curious in that it 's a very very hierarchical population  uhm with three  uh 

Oh I see I have to turn 

Sorry 

It 's a very hierarchical population so that you have the nobles who are  fair-skinned Berbers

Uhm they 're also sometimes very very fat

This girl 's actually force-feeding herself 

Uhm and they 're high status rich

They 're the ones who own most of the animals

Then you have the uhm  middle status groups who are  include blacksmiths  who you can actually identify visually  if you can focus the slide  cos they have they 're black

but they have very fine-featured faces

Uhm and then you have negroid slaves

And you can see that there 's a very strong difference between the way that she looks  and the way that uhm  the noble Berber woman looked

I mean they 're just totally different racially 

Uhm so we looked at the levels of fertility and mortality in these groups 

And what we found  was uhm  could you turn the slide projector off please uhm very substantial mortality differences within the population

So all these groups uh nobles slaves and the middle group all have exactly the same pastoral way of life

They live in the same tents in the same environment the same grotty water the same lack of access to health services

And yet  within the population you have very substantial mortality differences which go against all known wisdom about mortality

Basically the perceived wisdom is that  uhm with adults females have lower mortality than males uhm  i e they live longer  because they 're more biologically adapted except in north India and that in general if you look at infant and child mortality richer groups higher status more access to resources have lower mortality than the poor groups

And in the pastoral  population you get the complete opposite 

So if you look at first of all this is the probability of dying before age five

And so  thirty-four per cent of noble children in the desert die before age five

and only twenty-seven per cent of slave children 

So you 've got a converse of what you would expect

The nobles die more than the slaves 

In the  the differences are even more marked

forty-one per cent of noble children dying before age five compared with twenty-nine per cent of slaves  the intermediate group being intermediate 

With adult mortality  uhm what I 've given here is the expectation of life at age fifteen i e once you 've reached age fifteen the number of years you could expect to live 

Uhm

and you will see that in the in the Delta the females do have s the nobles do have slightly longer expectation of life than men but not much and certainly much less one would expect biologically  whereas the slaves  the conventional wisdom of female expectation of life being longer than men holds 

In the  you have the same pattern

The nobles in fact the men have a longer expectation of life than the women which goes against what you would expect 

The intermediate group uhm  the numbers were very small

so they 're rather uhm sort of suspicious

but anyway the the the women have longer expectation of life than men

and the  the women have much longer expectation of life than men

So  my theory is with these very different demographic patterns that you see within one pastoral population  shows that it cannot be pastoralism per se that is determining the demographic parameters here  but that you 've got something else

It 's much more to do with sociocultural factors  and next time I will explain why I think that these sociocultural factors are important and how they 're actually operating

My aim today  is to tell you about a number of different topics that interest me and upon which I 'm currently carrying out research which concern how ancient Egyptian scribes went about their work  the tools of their trade and their techniques  and which concern the use of writing literacy and education in Egypt 

I also want to suggest  that much of this detailed work can contribute to building up a better picture of what ancient Egyptian society was like  and of how it developed 

In fact literacy is rather a fashionable subject of research at the moment both in the study of the modern world  and in the study of the history of all periods and of all parts of the world 

Egyptologists over the last twenty years have joined in a general enthusiasm for social history 

Writing in Egypt began very early 

The idea of writing was not we now think actually invented in Egypt 

However we can follow a continuous history and development of writing there for longer and perhaps better than anywhere else 

The hieroglyphic script was invented close to the very beginning of the historical period in Egypt  not long after three thousand before the common era 

The principles of the script were not taken up with enthusiasm by other countries  but within Egypt itself we can trace the history of the script

There were other scripts such as Hieratic that developed from it for over three thousand years 

During the Greco-Roman period Greek became the language of the administration  and the Greek triba the Greek scribal tradition gained a foothold in Egypt 

Changes in scribal habits accompanied changes in education and in society 

Christianity brought a new approach to writing  and the desire to write the native Egyptian language in an expanded form of the Greek alphabet

This stage we now call Coptic 

A certain amount has been written recently on the extent of literacy in ancient Egypt 

The discussion has not reached a very high plane of sophistication mind you 

It is usual first to try to guess the total population of Egypt 

This is notoriously difficult 

I would consider it presumably varied perhaps quite dramatically from one period to another 

No pharaonic Egyptian source gives us this information 

Some classical writers attempted to 

but it is unclear how much reliance ought to be placed upon their figures 

Then the bulk of the population presumably worked on the land  but exactly how many 

And then recent writers  have tended to consider what kind of numbers of people were of sufficiently high status to have learned to read and write 

But for me this is precisely the question to be answered 

Those who specialise in the study of ancient agriculture do not seem to have reached a consensus as to what food production in Ancient Egypt could have supported in the way of population  nor the manpower needed for its production and distribution 

Again Egyptian archaeology does not on the whole provide us with typical towns with villages nor cities  with complete cemeteries or ground plans to analyse 

When we do have a certain amount of data to work with  it is from untypical sites such as workmen 's villages outside the cultivated area on the desert edge or for example  which briefly occupied the capital of placename 

A recent estimate puts the proportion of the literate in Egypt at around  half of a per cent certainly no more than one per cent 

This however is largely based on the assumption that we know what kind of people were literate 

Some information on this we do have 

It is for example clear  that pharaonic Egyptian society did not contain people whose status was so elevated that they felt writing to be beneath them 

The New Kingdom royal princes went to school with the children of important non-royal families and those of  foreign rulers in a royal school attached to the palace 

Thus the king could write 

In the Middle Kingdom literary text which we call The Prophecy of Name King Name of the Old Kingdom is described as asking the priest Mehotee to entertain him with some fine words 

Offered a choice of subject matter between the past and the future name not surprisingly selects the future 

Then the king reaches for his box of scribal equipment takes a papyrus roll and palette and settles to writing down what Mehotee has to tell him 

The passage is fiction

but it implies that there was that there was nothing surprising about seeing a great king writing or at any rate able to write 

We would assume that kings did not usually do their own secretarial work and letters and documents were usually read out to them at court 

The arguments that the great mass of the ancient Egyptian population could not read or write  is partly based upon our general perception of the nature and structure of the society  apart from the point that there is no positive evidence that anyone of clearly commoner status ever wrote anything

The much greater problem is to assess the real position in society of the writers whose work we do possess 

The author of a letter for example may evidently own land or boast some administrative or priestly title

but what does this mean 

Uh let me sketch for you the normal equipment used by the Egyptian scribe 

First the writing ground 

For Egyptian scribes of all periods  the writing material par excellence was the papyrus roll 

Other writing grounds were in common use leather wooden boards flakes of limestone or broken pieces of pottery

However  many characteristics of Egyptian writing seem to have been termed seem to have been determined by the nature of papyrus and of the papyrus roll 

And the dominance of the roll was not challenged until well into the Roman period 

Uh please could we have the lights down  now 

Well I cannot here discuss papyrus manufacture 

I 'd like to mention it briefly  but by way of a  pleasant illustration

Here 's a nice one 

Essentially strips freshly cut from the pith of the stems of the papyrus plant were used

Individual sheets of papyrus were made by arranging first one layer of parallel strips laid down side by side  just touching one another or very slightly overlapping  and then a second similar layer with its strips running at right angles to those of the first 

The supple freshly cut papyrus plant provided natural adhesive properties 

And after pressing or hammering the strips cohered to form a strong supple sheet 

In Pharaonic Egypt a very thin and nearly white sheet was considered the ideal  though one not always achieved in later periods 

It is quite clear that although individual sheets of papyrus  must have sat in piles in workshops you could not go and buy them 

The manufacturer pasted the sheets up into rolls making each sheet overlap its neighbour by about a quarter to a half an inch 

Rolls of twenty sheets were standard although these could be pasted together to produce much longer rolls if it was desired to write for example a large account roll or a substantial book of the dead 

For small tasks the writing of a short letter for example the user could in theory have regarded the standard roll as stock in hand from which to cut off small pieces as required 

However in fact the practice was to work with the complete roll and to cut free the portion used after the text had been written 

You have there the front and the back  of a letter from north Sakara on which Professor Smith and myself are working 

The letter 's been written in short lines down the extreme  edge of the first unrolled part of the roll

and then when the job was completed  the strip was cut free 

The pen

Well the normal script of everyday life during the Pharaonic period was the Hieratic script 

This was a natural development from the hieroglyphic script  in which each s sign came to be written more rapidly as a simplified or abbreviated or even a completely stylized form 

Hieratic emerged at a very early stage almost as soon as we can observe hieroglyphic script  

And it became not only the script for practical everyday use but also the script for the scribes to learn first the staple of their education

Hieratic was always written from right to left for reasons that I shall try to explain later 

Hieratic was written with a rush pen 

This consisted of a convenient length about five to nine inches of the stem of the round  rush Juncus  which is commonly found growing wild in Egypt 

The writing end was usually cut obliquely with a knife  and the fibres that form the sheaths of the plant stem were often lightly chewed to achieve a stiff but almost brush-like point 

The rush thus tended to produce thick and thin strokes automatically according to their according to the direction of movement of the pen as in the modern italic hand

But this could be overridden in various ways  both by twisting the pen in the fingers and by changing the angle of the whole hand  so that Egyptian writing never showed an entirely mechanical alternation  of thick and thin strokes 

To judge from Egyptian two-dimensional pictures of scribes at work the writer seems to have held the pens some one and a half to three inches from its writing end  and not to have let the heel of the hand rest upon the writing surface uh except when  

In some ways the use of the rush pen resembles that of the brush Chinese and Japanese  calligraphy

However the rush pen was not held vertically in the typical Chinese fashion but at an angle 

The grip was not unlike that most commonly adopted by modern European writers using the thumb and the first and second fingers 

The action however we should describe more as painting than scripting 

From what I 've already said  it would be apparent that every Egyptian scribe must have possessed a sharp knife  first in order to cut letters or documents free from the whole papyrus roll  when they had been written  and secondly perhaps to shape his pen 

Scribes also often cut whole rolls in half or into thirds rather in the manner of someone slicing a baguette or  a sausage in order to produce two or three rolls with a smaller page height 

It is odd but we 're not sure what these knives might 've been like 

In museums and exhibitions you often see one kind of knife called the scribe 's knife or  of that

But I am not aware that there is any solid evidence to associate this type with scribal use 

The normal ink of the Pharaonic period was carbon black  lamp black or soot if you like finely ground then mixed with water and gum arabic or a similar glue 

This neither fades

nor does it damage the papyrus writing material 

In fact once dried in place it 's fairly tough  although if you both moisten it and rub it is removed easily and virtually  completely 

It was not kept ready for use in liquid form but as round cakes  rather like the rectangular blocks of watercolours of modern times 

It is really getting dark

Now this is but an artist 's palette with a wider range of colours 

The scribe 's palette was originally a very small wooden board

As a way of starting into this and to and to link it with uh very much with the R S A 's uh theme uhm  it 's I think it 's probably in one sense it 's a romantic notion

but I woul this phrase that uh in nature nothing is wasted seems to have a certain degree of truth

I suppose what I have in mind and it 's obviously a sort of a metaphor in a way  is that if ag if for example when a tree dies the nutrients in it rot away uhm  and  go back into the soil and provide the uh  the food and the fuel for for for further growth and in that sense there is an ecology as say in a garden or or forest or a wood

In a sense  nothing is wasted

Physicists would tell us I suppose that it 's almost impossible or very difficult to actually lose energy it

it always reappears in some kind of of form

And that 's quite a valid and interesting metaphor I think for uhm organisational life

It seems to me a m matter of uhm  sort of obvious common sense observation that uh  human organisations institutions are uhm are human made

They 're artefacts in that sense

And unfortunately the same principle doesn't  so obviously apply to human organisations

Human organisations are are  very capable as I say here of uhm  of of waste and inefficiency and and things like that

I suppose there are absolutely just very obvious examples uh for us in  in society at the moment that we have for example I suppose both homeinle homelessness and empty buildings

and we have unemployment and uh obviously useful social work that needs to be done

We have uh people going hungry and we have food mountains

Those kinds are very obvious things

and I 'm sure you could all add to that list of kind of uh symptoms if you like of waste and inefficiency in organised society

Uhm

so the the interesting question I think that the the notion of the learning organisation addresses is is there some way in which organisations uh can contribute to making society better in this sense

if organisations were more like what I 'm going to argue  would be learning organisations would would there be less of those wasteful and in inefficient phenomena around us aff affecting our everyday everyday lives

So that 's the kind of orienting question

uhm  and I think a a a second point is to say that I think perhaps it 's interesting to there 's a it 's worth rehearsing the argument that  thinking about organisations and institutions is a useful level at which to deal with this because we can on the one hand uhm uh I suppose consider what one can do at the kind of n nation state level and the political uh level to deal with these problems but that 's for a lot of us sort of very very grandiose stuff uh

whereas most of us uhm  work with or in or for uhm organisations and have already some ability possibly to uh  to influence those

Uhm

I think it 's also true that uhm organisations commercial and otherwise uh have in recent decades become uh uh extremely influence influential and dominant in uh in shaping everyday lives of ourselves and and other people

uhm

And in a way with the kind of uhm trend towards uh privatisation-free mo market economy philosophies uh political devolution and breaking up to some extent of uh of of nation states uhm  it seems to me even more the case now that uhm that commercial and other organisations are in fact the the one of the prime movers in in shaping society

I think if one ponders uh Eastern Europe and uh now the ex U S S R uh it seems quite plausible to to believe or argue that uhm  what will actually shape the everyday lives and the prosperity of people in those in those situations will actually be the the new forms of commercial enterprise

Whether uh Western and Japanese firms that move in or new indigenous firms and companies it 's ko going to be quite a lot to do with how how those operations evolve that will shape the everyday lives of people and their prosperity in their situations perhaps more or more than would have been in the past than their the political systems and so on that that uh that they evolve

uhm 

so organisations seem to me at the current moment to be a particularly influential uh force in in society

but it 's also a level that we can begin to think about how we can work with not too uhm  uh too grandiose and and esoteric 

Uhm

I 'm going to obviously have to address this question about what what do we mean by uh learning organisations uhm le learning companies

Uh there are a variety of ways of thinking about it but obviously a straightforward way is to say well learning is what any any inst individual institution entity does to to change and adapt and survive and fit in with changing uhm  changing circumstances

And it 's possible to argue from that that any almost any organisation that survives for a reasonable period of time uhm must to some degree be be a learning organisation

I sometimes try and explain this with a kind of a health metaphor

I say that uh anybody who 's actually not not dead is healthy to some extent  uhm like me uh

It doesn't mean we 're super fit or anything like that but we everybody has health fortunately

It can be good or bad but we all have enough  minimal level of health to to to stay alive at the moment thank thank goodness

Uh so in that sense every organisation that survives a reasonable period of time is in my book a learning organisation in at least uh a weak sense

uhm  I 'm

one shouldn't pass over that point too lightly by the way uh

and it 's it 's quite an interesting thought to think about how long various organisations  last

I think I heard on the television last night that around two hundred businesses are failing every day in in the current recession which is which is which is food for thought

Uhm  uh  organisat studies of organisations and sm small business and uh uhm new ventures uh do show even in non-recessionary times

Uh even in California and Silicon Silicon Valley uh in its economic boom times an awful lot of the small firms that get founded actually don't last more than a year or eighteen months

Uhm now one could argue this is OK

In the kind of ecology metaphor it 's like turtle eggs

A thousand have to be laid for a hundred to hatch uh for ten to survive for a year or two

It may just be that that 's the way the organisational system works  but it it does make make you think and ponder

The other sort of i in interesting thought for me and perhaps you 'd reflect on it too is if you say following this line of thought that uhm well really good learning organisations must be the ones that last an awful long time 

And uh if you think we can have a competition if you like later on uh uh as to wha which organisations which what what are the oldest organisations in society uhm  I suspect they would be various religious church type organisations  uh probably some ancient universities and not new ones like mine which is a mid-sixties one though even that has seen some large corporations  come and go since since since its founding

Uh 

and one sets against that a kind of an everyday stereotype that many of these long-standing organisations church organisations ancient universities are really rather rigid and conservative and and so on and so forth and not terribly flexible it would seem to everyday perception

So I think there 's an interesting little paradox there to ponder why why it is that some of these very long-standing organisations which therefore must uh by my definition at least be be healthy and learning organisations in some way how they come to uh come to survive

I I will leave that question uhm  hanging for now

Uhm 

but I think what I 'm talking about here is is learning organisations in the stronger sense uh as opposed to the to the weaker sense

And uh you can tell from the next slide that I 've only just I 'm still very much working on my my thinking about about this

this is a   formulation that I came to on the train on the way down today  

It 's occurred it occurred to me on the train to sort out this business of weak and strong learning organisations to try out a kind of three three level don't worry if you can't read it I I 'll read it for you a sort of three levels or three a s a three step hierarchy if you like of uh degrees of learning formats in organisations

Uhm at the first level I think it 's it 's it could be say a any organisation has a kind of a memory uhm i it 's

at least it learns processes and then procedurises them and and keeps them going

And what I 'm obviously talking about here is the classic phenomena of bureaucracy

What bureaucracy is is finding something that works and then setting up stable conditions and procedures and rules and rulebooks and working practices and so on that reliably and economically uh and punctually repeat that performance because it 's something that 's useful to do

and it keeps going on

So any organisation that achieves that performance has learnt in the kind of at least re re remembering a procedure and being able to to repreat repeat it sense

So that seems to be the first level of of learning uhm learning organisation

And I 'm sure we can all think of examples

Uh

uhm 

the second is organisations uh what  called as adapting systems

Uh

systems theorists tend to prefer this way of thinking about organisational learning organisations that manage to change and adapt to meet whatever changing circumstances of markets or demands or economies or uh social interests that that that surround them and and affect their survival

But th they are self-interested primarily the

the outcome of learning is is their is their survival

Uhm

and the third level of organisations are organisations as as I will explain in my strong sense of a definition of organisational learning develop their context uhm  make their own world uh  better for them to live in and to contribute to

And it 's organisational learning in that in this form which I think is of interest

In a moment ag it may sound fanciful

but again I was pondering the uh the break-up of the Soviet Union and the and the So and the apparent uh demi demise of of Communism

and it it it occurred to me at least as an argument that 's worth rehearsing uhm that it 's not so much the fundamental ideology of Communism that that has failed it 's simply that nobody found a form of uh organisations and institutions to put the philosophy into practice because I suppose uh in in a way what Marx was uh uh having a go at was uh obviously capitalist institutions which I think hover between one and two uh uhm as sort of exploitative self-interested capitalist institutions

Uhm

uh

but what appears to have happened in practice in states run under a Communist regime has has been that they failed to find institutions that moved to a kind of level two or level three and in fact have primarily generated institutions that work at the level one bureaucracy level which have not then been competitive say with uh the American and Japanese forms of organisation

And in some sense that has that has been that has been and continues to be uh the problem

That 's probably a fanciful argument but at least I think it 's worth worth pondering on

But I hope those those three stages beg uh give a beg beginnings of a way to think about some of the issues that are at stake in in the in the learning organisation 

So let me move on to attempt a little bit of of uhm s say a definition and some conceptualization of this

Uhm

I should say in passing that uh what I 'm saying is based t to a degree on various uh  programmes of research that that we 've conducted

I went to the Israeli war in nineteen sixty-seven

And what I did is I was in Cyprus

I 'd been to Egypt

I came back to London on the Sunday  jumped on a plane and went to Cyprus on the Monday cos I 'd heard the Israelis were bringing a plane to lift the press in you see for the Six Day War 

They did bring the plane 

When I arrived in the early hours of the morning in Israel from Cyprus I was really excited and I wanted to go

And then the battle of Jerusalem was shaping up and there was the Sinai was virtually won you know

And I said to Murray Sayle I 'm going to go to Jerusalem cos I thought you know the Holy City is the most important aspect of the war

Everybody else went south 

Murray went south and I went north with a Sunday Times reporter

There was a big team of us you see 

And I arrived in the early hours of the morning

I 'd got my pass from the Israelis  had a quick breakfast jumped in a car and went to Jerusalem with Colin Simpson of the Sunday Times 

And when we got to Jerusalem the uhm Israeli paratroopers were marshalling

They were grouping for the assault on the city

They were below the old medieval walls  uhm near the Lions ' Gate

That was their objective 

And uhm  you know  they didn't know who I was what I was doing there

Why are you here

Who are you

You know

And I said I 'm from the press

Oh press

They were kind of pleased you know

Cos once you get to the front line the soldiers are pleased to see you  because they want to know that the world knows their commitment

you know

They want it to They want to know that it 's not just confined to them and their imminent death or injury and so on They

They want to know that other people know about their circumstance 

But that 's not what the the hierarchy wants 

They don't care about that it seems 

So anyway we we got the were grouping there and I was about in the tomb of David  which all sounds amazing in the twentieth century you know 

And uhm  the one thing I never needed in my life even though I got the you know a lot of respect for some of them and not for a lot of them was a reporter 

I used to get rid of reporters you know cos I didn't want to feel as if I had to pay lip service to their 

so

and I had my own work to do and my own drive

You know I don't like crossing the road in London with more than one person and that 's me  cos you know it 's bad enough worrying about yourself getting knocked down

And that 's what war 's like

You don't want to worry about anybody else

So  anyway the Israelis were ready

They gave the command and they ran down this road towards the Lions ' Gate and we burst through the Lions ' Gate and all the shit came and you know Israeli soldiers were wounded and that 

But uhm quite honestly I wasn't supposed to be there  because I didn't have an Israeli escort officer 

Now my biggest fear was that they would find out and they would take all my film away for censorship cos you had to do that and

So what I did was I checked into

I I was in the battle

The battle was won in one day virtually

You know they captured the city

there was lots of euphoria 

I didn't quite understand  what I was in you know

I was sitting down

and an Israeli soldier came up to me

and he said

why are you sitting here when history has been made

Why are you not at the Wailing Wall

And I thought what 's he talking about

You know

You know the boy from North London you know was the total academic who had the the kind of you know the uhm the religious history totally under his belt

So I sat there

and I thought

now what 's he talking about

I was drinking a Coke and I was a bit shaky and a bit a bit high you know

And then I wandered round through these alleys

and I saw all these Israeli soldiers all up against the wall you know with the different scarves on

you know

and I thought

hello

that looks interesting

You know

wallop and bang

And then I wandered away from that cos it was very small in those days these the Wailing Wall because they hadn't cleared it as they did in later years

So  it was getting dark and there was an eerie chill coming over the city 

And really what it was

it was my cooling of my blood and adrenalin that made me feel this June night chillier than it should have been in June in the Middle East 

And I thought oh I 'm going to get out of here

I 'll go and  go and find a hotel 

And I was reluctant to leave the Old City cos I knew that it wouldn't be easy to get back in the next day cos I know how these military people work

They cordon the area off stop you getting in and all that

So I went to the King David Hotel and checked in 

And I went down to desk and there was a lot of you know a lot of everyone was excited

And the man said what are you

I said I 'm a photographer

He said oh there 's another photographer here Mr Cornell Name

So he said he 's in room so-and-so and uh

So I said oh OK

And I went down to the room and I knocked on the door

So he said come in come in come in you know

And uh and I could see Cornell on the phone to New York cos he was working for Life magazine 

And you see what I was looking at was the established photographer the man who  knew knew it all like

You know confidence how to expose film

the international traveller 

And I was very much the kind of novice you know

And I looked at him and he he was on the phone to New York and he gave me a long five hundred yard stare you know 

Come come and sit down 

Have a coffee and sit down

So I sat down

He put the phone down

Then he looked at me

and that was the beginning of our you know friendship and that which now seems to have died lately

I don't know why

but

uh

Anyway uhm  what I 'm really getting at was that at that stage I 'd only been in Israel  for about a day and a half

you know

not even a full day

No cos in fact I I arrived in Israel at two o'clock in the morning the following the previous morning 

Then I 'd gone through that day and then I 'd woken up at eight o'clock in the morning

Well it was eight in 

So I was in basically in Israel about uhm  oh a day and a bit you know 

So I thought  there 's no point in going back into the Old City

I had a look around and there was not much going on and there wasn't there wasn't 

I thought I know what I 'm going to do

I 'm going to go straight back to London

So I went back to Tel Aviv and jumped on a plane that night for London 

And when I got to the airport I was only the only person uh me and about four or five other people on the plane back to London 

And uhm there was such euphoria that no one said

oh

what were you doing

and all that

and why are you leaving

Cos they said 

why are you leaving 

Stay and have a holiday

And I said no

I 've got to go back to London 

They didn't say

why are you a photographer

or anything like that

When I got back to England I hadn't gone through the Israeli censorship 

So the next time I went back to Israel  and I wanted to leave I got to the airport they stripped me completely naked and made me bend over and touch my toes at the airport 

And I thought you know this is very nice  coming from a bunch of people who 've got my exhibition on  in the in the in the museum in Jerusalem

You know Cornell had arranged this exhibition and my work was amongst it 

And I thought

would they do this to Yehudi Menuhin you know who 'd just given a recital in in in in Jerusalem

Would they strip him  ballock-naked and make him bend over at the airport

I remember what I I shot that picture that day

it was a hundred and twenty-fifth at f eight 

And I know for a fact that it was a dull day

it was raining

It was a slight rain and there was a lot of smoke from the burning bodies and the burning eucalyptus trees

And I was with a man called Martin Meredith

and we 'd already been arrested by  the Muslims on the other side of the museum to cross back into Beirut cos I was there the day before I was thrown out by the Falange

Then I came back

and on the way back I got a Falange pass found on me by the Muslims who wanted to cut my throat 

You know you heard all that story 

And so I was pretty shaken by the time they left me and I got back into the the massacre area of Klarantino 

And when I got there they were still torturing and killing prisoners and I saw it and I witnessed some people were being killed 

They said

you don't take any pictures

otherwise you you get killed

And there were threats all round

You know in Beirut you saw the most extraordinary things but you were under the most incredible threats not to photograph them 

And uh I was walking piles of by piles of  murdered bodies that hadn't been torched

I was walking by piles of heaps of bodies that had been torched cos there was these black charred embers of grotesque  figures you know and uhm  all around were the the kind of scenes that are of of of of you know appalling scenes of dead women lying under trees and dead families

Uhm

I didn't see too many much evidence of of dead children

but that came later at another big massacre at a place called Tel Alsata which took place you know several weeks later where they did kill lots lots of children

But however uhm  they still had little collective groups of prisoners in doorways and under buildings which they were torturing and stabbing and shooting 

One man had ran run away made

had the courage to run as we all think we would if we were in those uhm circumstances

but you can't cos oftener than not you 're so terrified your legs are like jelly 

This man suddenly fled past me and Martin Meredith and all these Falange started firing at him and the bullets were going over our head very close to our head because he ran right past us 

There 's a wonder they didn't shoot us in the back

And the bullets were hitting the wall and and ricocheting on the ceiling

And then he ran down this alleyway so we ran as well  with the guys who were then chasing him

And he was blocked at the alleyway by another lot of guys who then kicked him to the ground and one man went up and opened a whole magazine of M Sixteen into his head

And And the man I remember the man the air coming out of his larynx as he was gasping  his last breath and all he had left of him was the front of his forehead

The whole rest of his  skull had been completely disintegrated with a you know virtual magazine of M Sixteen

It was quite horrific 

And then Martin and I walked away having had the shock of the confinement by the Muslims the other side of the of the green line at the museum who threatened to murder us  then coming to that and seeing this 

Then we were walking away and I could hear this kind of this mandolin this lute being strummed and it seemed so bizarre 

And we passed a lot of dead bodies

And we were warned not to photograph dead bodies not to photograph any

just get going leave this area

And uhm I said 

oh

I said to Martin

let 's go

you know

I 'd resigned myself to f you know that that was it

So anyway we uh  heard these this lute and I looked up and I saw this amazing scene

And I had my cameras and I was looking around cos I 'd been warned and I didn't want another threat of death you know 

And this man said hey mister

take this photo

And I thought

shall I and 

and I tried to take a quick exposure

you know

And And it was I didn't get the reading quick enough and I and I did a hundred and twentieth at f eight 

And And basically I could have given it another three quarters of a stop half a stop more 

but I still had the image

you know

I only took two pictures  uh two pictures

One wasn't as good as the other 

And then I moved away and as I moved away I heard them I heard someone screaming in Arabic

I heard pow like that

and I looked

and a man  was shooting another man point blank in the stomach

If one thinks about the world of microscopy then  this is a practical example of a a microscope

There has actually been a great breakthrough in the use of microscopes the light microscope over the last ten years 

And the biggest change has actually happened at this end of the microscope because nowadays with people 's uhm eyes not being able to sort of fit into the uhm eyepiece at the top then this end of the microscope is  replaced by an array of video cameras and uh computer selection things

It 's now getting possible for the images or the light that comes out here to be analysed in a much more sophisticated way 

The only important thing that 's happened is that uh it 's now possible to use such a low light level that in fact if you were to look down some microscopes now you couldn't see an image that 's coming up simply because now you can have photo detectors which are are so sensitive that in fact they can receive the image and process it even though when you look down the tube you can't see it

And that of course is the spin off from the uhm ability to shoot tanks in the dark that you have developed uhm really very uh sensitive cameras that could deal with that 

Going up to this end then there 's been a whole cottage industry

and uh one of the key people in that role is called Michael  from the Image uhm Processing Group in the Physics Department here which enables the picture that comes up the tube here  to be portrayed on the television screen

and if you think back to a television screen as being rows of pixels and so for example you could imagine the square up there being a pixel frame two hundred and fifty-six by two hundred and fifty-six you can actually digitise images now 

Not only can you digitise them

you can hold each one up individually and decide its degree of darkness or lightness

And so you can imagine building up pictures on a frame of twenty two five six by two five six and also on top of that have the ability to be able to tell the difference between something that 's very white which you could give a a gradience value of nought to something that 's completely black uh two five six

And later on in this talk I hope we 'll get on to that

And the second thing that features uhm large in light microscopy at the moment is the ability to actually use target fluorescent molecules 

so instead of using just ordinary light you know in fact you use something that 's got a fluorescine tag

And what that means is that the light you send through the specimen has a certain wavelength

and depending on the chemical character of your fluorochrome then the chemical absorbs that light and pushes out a wavelength that 's usually about twenty-five  uh nanometres further up

So by selectively using filters you can in fact uhm get information about specific molecules for example within cells 

Well our own  our own eyes are capable of detecting things probably about point five  millimetres across whereas a microscope usually operates on on photon cells usually in the range of about  ten or a hundred below that 

The limited resolution of the light microscope is practically about half the wavelength of the light we are using

So given that a micrometre is a thousandth of a metre this 'll normally be about point two five of a micrometre

There isn't a level in it when we use the the microscope as such 

And as a result of the increase in uh technology if you like it 's now possible to resolve  certainly microtubules which are only uhm point O two five microns across by using rather sophisticated computer techniques

So whereas intrinsically we know we can only uhm  see in the microscope things down to point two five microns in reality we can in fact now go to an order of magnitude below that 

Well the second part of the the title really relates to looking at movements

And the next thing I am going to talk about relates to the movement of single cells

And as a general rule although not always cells move for one of two purposes or sometimes both

uhm

I 'm not sure which is the most important

But certainly first of all one is food and certainly in the free-living single cell the the idea of motility is to bring them to a food source or if they 're using photosynthesis to bring them to a light source where they can carry out that process

And the second uh purpose is in fact involved in sex or more strictly I suppose the exchange of D N A 

When you look at moving cells they fall into two general categories

The first category are those cells which seem to be able to move through the bulk medium

And those people who heard Michael Whittaker 's talk a week or so ago are well aware that things like the sperm  swim in a bulk medium so you get a swimming process

In reality most cells that that people have looked at I think probably need a substrate

that is they need a surface to move on 

And although uhm surface uh moving organisms

You can divide them into two general sorts

One of the sorts is divided into crawling which is characterised by movement of a particle and the amoeba

And in this form then the cell has quite uhm uh extensive changes in cell shape

And the second form which we 'll talk a little bit about is a form known as gliding where the cell doesn't change shape and for all intents and purposes looks like a motorised sausage without much clue about how it 's moving 

As far as the biophysical aspects of movement at this level uhm there are two important things to realise

First of all uhm as a result of the small size of these cells

and the average cell is generally thought to be probably somewhere between ten and twenty microns in diameter 

so as a result of that small size generally the movement should be perceived as if the item were trying to swim in a swimming pool of treacle

That is the viscous forces are very very strong indeed

And as a result of that then again for all intents and purposes the inertial force of the cell is virtually zero

So once the motor cuts off then the cell stops

It was calculated once for one of the small bacteria that once the bacterial motor stopped then the inertial force of the bacteria was just about enough to proceed the distance about the equivalent of the width of a hydrogen atom

So when you see things gliding uhm they don't glide as a paper aeroplane glides

they glide because they generate force on the 

Just under two hundred years ago Robert Brown who was a botanist  looked at pollen grains as they were jostling around

It was generally thought then that this rather random movement which was subsequently called Brownian movement was due to the live character of the pollen grains and life was somehow associated with with motility

We now know that 's not true uhm but at the time it was

He observed that

And it wasn't till later when he quite by chance happened to find a a droplet of water which 'd been incarcerated in a piece of cork so it was many millions of years old where he observed exactly the same phenomenon

And therefore even though he was a botanist he overcame his prejudices and said it was down to physical forces 

And uh so hopefully most of the time I 'm going to spend showing you sort of various video tapes of these uhm generators

But while I remember  we talked about digitising images and uh this is actually a a bit that came from  an article by Forename Name who 's in the audience

So basically you have this rather poor picture from the television screen and if you use the right technology you can actually track down to that the cell

And those people who know cells will clearly identify the contractile vacuole here

Those of you who don't will have to take my word for it

The other thing that shows up quite clearly is that whereas we normally accommodate background illumination once you 've digitised these images this bit at the bottom is simply due to the fact that the uhm the illumination produced by the bulb that 's coming up through the microscope is in fact very uneven illumination

and again another enormous breakthrough has been an ability to set your microscope out of focus with its actual background subtraction therefore  

Well I won't say much about Brownian movement

But here is a thing from Scientific American which clearly shows the path of the particle  going in this sort of random walk in this way

So you can have motility that you can observe and that was of course observed down the microscope and uh if I can press the right button it will in fact  I hope

I 've even brought my bicycle light for this because I 've been caught out on this before 

Well this is in fact polystyrene B which is about one micron across

This is in fact indulging in Brownian movement

Brownian movement is really due to the fact that it 's being collided by solvent molecules

And since it 's got a fluorescent tag on it you can also follow it by using fluorescent optics 

And if not too many people slam the door on the corridor then in fact

This on the other hand is a sample of bacteria 

Could you turn dim the lights down a bit 

Well you know the bacteria but this is uhm  an organism an alga called a ziagon

This fits into the category of cells that actually glide

As you can see it 's it fits into the motorised sausage concept

But we have no real idea how that 's achieved except to say that it does move and it does require a substrate

And uh in general you can tell whether these require substrates or not because they stay in focus

If you get something swimming in the medium then it won't 

Since they contain chlorophyll you can in fact change your optics to fluorescence

And actually the chloroplast shines up in that way 

This is uhm another algal cell well a protozoan cell probably and it has this flagellum sticking out that end

Normally flagella are used for swimming in the medium but in many organisms it 's a mechanism of having a sticky flagellum that 's actually walking along the substrate where they presumably sweep up bacteria and eat that 

Also when you look in natural water you very frequently find amoebae which are

One up there

I think if you watch it really hard it 's difficult to believe it 's moving 

Frequently when uh

These are just uhm ordinary open water samples

You 'll see creatures like this one and if you try and capture it you can spend ages and ages watching them 

Then finally they disappear

These are two amoebae of rather bizarre shapes that 've been taken out and these are all sort of natural waters

I think the first one was actually a brackish water

This is uhm a sample we 've taken from Hampton Court Park on Sunday 

Present within natural water you often get things a bit like vacuum cleaners

you can see the stalk running up here

here 's the cell body and on the front edge here you have a mass of these very small hair-like organelles called cilia 

And I think you can

I can't see very well from here

Here you can see the development of the current that 's pulling bits in

Clearly big  don't go in but the idea is that things like bacteria are filtered off passed down into here where they 're broken down 

I don't suppose anyone can guess what this is

It is in fact a soil sample from the front quad at U C L

And uhm what 's surprising is that when you take this out there are actually amoebae and there is life in the front quad 

There 's amoeba there amoeba there and a bigger one there 

This is really developing the  motorised sausage uhm  hypothesis

And you saw a motorised sausage of a different sort there 

And for the next bit of the talk I 'd like to be talking

We 've just had a really quick look probably not very good uhm  at these single cell organisms that live in natural ponds soil in the front quad etc

Now can I  remind you what we 've covered in this series so far  on ancient Egyptian art

We have looked at statuary from the Old uh Kingdom Middle Kingdoms 

We 've looked at relief and painting from uh those periods

We 've looked at statuary from the New Kingdom 

and today we are going to be looking at paintings  that come from this period between dynasties eighteen to twenty  five hundred years of the apogee of the Egyptian empire 

and mainly this uh lecture will centre around the superb legacy that we have from the tombs of the courtiers  at Thebes 

There 's an echo in here that 's going to drive me mad

But never mind 

We 'll try and live with it

shall we 

Can anybody trace it

It sounds 

Anyone got a bucket of water we can drop it in whatever it is 

Right uhm 

Now relief and painting from this period is evidence as I say mainly from uh Thebes

But before we actually start on these tombs of the courtiers which are  uh so eloquent in the  uh information that they give us from ancient Egypt 

What some of the things we can't consider in the scope of this talk because there isn't time

First of all we can't really take in  the  uh reliefs that you find decorating the mortuary temples on the west bank at Thebes or the temple of Karnac for example on the east bank 

Uh we can't also uhm include the reliefs from Abydos 

These we take separate lectures to do

One example of what we 're going to have to ignore today

the uh head on the screen there of Tothmoses the Third the great warrior pharaoh  wearing his beautiful  crown of ram horns  uhm two conical  uh conical-shaped and two ostrich feathers on each side

This is one of the reliefs from his temple at  and you can see the paint surviving details on the  eyebrow and the cosmetic line from the eye to the side of the face 

All this uh an example of the lavishness of this original structure now almost totally ruined 

Then the tombs of the kings 

again something we can't  uh go into

They develop over five hundred years from schematic decorations like you see here where you 've got the Sun God dominating one of these underworld snakes which has got four legs and wings

You can see all the creatures of the Egyptian imagination 

Of course the tombs then become coloured full of detail  uhm

Here the journey of the Sun God through the Underworld 

Then the evil servant  at the bottom there being dominated by the god Attum 

And from the tomb of  which is one of the finest although not completed you can see the beautiful colours the greenish tinge of the face of Osiris there the jackal god Anubis and the hawk god Horus 

The Valley of the Queens

also we can't dwell here I 'm afraid today

The tomb of Ne Nefertari the wife of Rameses the Second currently being restored by a joint Egyptian and American uh programme 

hopefully one day again accessible

but of course in a very friable state due to the salt pushing through the rock and pushing the reliefs off the off the wall

Here is the uhm goddess Isis leading  Queen Nefertari there safely to meet the Sun God uh Hekri 

Tombs of the princes in the Valley of the Queens we have to ignore again I 'm afraid

Remember those uh princes that were heirs apparent but died before reaching the uh the throne

They were buried  in the  Place of Beauty which was the ancient name for the  Valley of the Queens 

and uh mainly during the reign of Rameses the Third the king whom you see on the left-hand side there who shows himself in their tombs

And in this instance he 's being embraced by the goddess Isis 

What we could consider in a whole lecture would be the papyrus scrolls called the Books of the Dead because these give us some very fine uh e examples of ancient Egyptian art but again the topic is too immense for us to try and cope with the other amount of information we have to cover

There on one of the papyri you can see the deceased travelling in a boat on the river of the underworld  and at the bottom a figure uh ploughing 

Gradually over recent years it 's been quite evident that there were magnificent tombs in the north of Egypt

Uh evidence is very heavily loaded in favour of the southern courtiers the the officials of upper Egypt

But the excavations by the Egypt Explorations Society and uh Leiden University have revealed some of the most important officials of the New Kingdom at Sakara on the escarpment overlooking the  causeway 

Uh

officials like Maya  uhm  's tomb before he became pharaoh  

All these can be found there

and some of the reliefs  of immense interest

there from  's tomb is a a group  of Nubians 

faces distinguished you see each from the other

With enemies with foreigners the Egyptians introduced a realism that we find absent for the most part in the portrayals of the courtiers 

There 's a scene of the officials on their horses  relatively relative newcomers onto the Nile Valley certainly not much earlier than uh the arrival of the  in Egypt 

An interesting detail such as the prisoner there receiving a punch on the jaw from the uh from the Egyptian official

This is gradually redressing our emphasis on the south 

And the tomb of Horum-Heb is one of the masterpieces of the uh Memphite necropolis 

Right

Well after that preamble we can now launch into the evidence of Egyptian art for  these this period

And the courtiers themselves are shown in stele just as we have seen in previous dynasties  these funerary monuments which decorated the courtyards of the tomb or the superstructure of the tomb itself 

And in them  their own right they become minor works of art

For example here on the left-hand side you can see the official  with the perfumed pomade on his head very elaborate wig the waves of that wig clearly delineated 

In front  his eldest son performing the ritual which we know as opening the mouth ceremony of vivifying all statues reliefs and the body of the deceased  for its uh life in the tomb and in the hereafter 

And on the right hand side here one of the priests wearing the panther skin  in the Louvre museum showing us the fine quality of  raised relief during this period which we 're going to be looking at 

There is an official

Look at the  detail of the ringlets of the wig 

his collar 's the actual  linen that you see there  uh beautifully captured by the Egyptian artist 

And this as we have always said is the real measure of skill because the hieroglyphs here are incised into the limestone

They 're fine but that 's fairly straightforward

The skill is for the artist to cut the background away and leave the figure of the official and his wife as you see slightly raised from the surface

And some of the finest tombs you can possibly visit in Egypt such as the tomb of Ramoser on the west bank at Thebes

the vizier of Amanhotep the Third evidences this style 

Well this is the source of most of our information uh at least as we are considering it uh in this lecture

The west bank at Thebes 

During its heyday these tombs that we are seeing the paintings from had elaborate superstructures gleaming white with plaster over the uh limestone decorated with stele statues 

In  post-pharaonic times and with the eclipse of Thebes itself as a royal necropolis many of these tombs were not looked after by the mortuary priests  and gradually became dilapidated

The lucky ones were  protected by falls of shale from the limestone cliffs 

others were built into by the houses  of the modern village on the west bank as you can see there

And of course during the nineteenth century we can't hide the fact Egypt became very much of a hunting ground for agents on behalf of museums in Europe 

But before we look at the paintings let 's look at the technique that the Egyptians used for decorating these tombs 

We have the information from those tombs which are not finished  from ostraka

that 's sketches on limestone flakes  produced by Egyptian artists for them to work on the larger surface uh from

and putting it together we can accept this reconstruction by the Metropolitan Museum New York of a tomb being cut

On the right-hand side you have the men cutting away into the fairly soft uh limestone 

Then the wall is plastered and allowed to dry 

It is then divided into that grid which you can see the draughtsmen on the left producing 

That grid allows so many squares for the head so many for the  shoulders to the midriff and so on

Everything is in proportion 

Below are sketches these ostraka from which the miniature  drawing in exact proportions is transferred to the larger surface 

Now this work is painstaking

The actual cutting out of a tomb is not necessarily going to take more than uh two years or so

Probably a lot less for the smaller ones of course

But this work can take up to five years the decoration of the actual wall itself 

The purpose is to  get adequately all the necessary information that the courtier would wish to have on his tomb wall

He has chosen from the scribe 's pattern books what scenes he wishes in his tomb

And of course it 's dependent on his status  what kind of official he was as to s the extent of decoration 

This is a uh  a fairly  uh common style tomb that you see being cut here

T-shape 

and could be decorated as I say within uh five years 

The result here for example of such a decoration adequately done in a small tomb represented in the tomb of Menna on the west bank at Thebes

Osiris in his pavilion on the left-hand side 

the official 's coming towards  raising his hand his face hacked out by a later enemy

One way of getting back at uh somebody who  uh had upset a person this deliberate uh destruction of the tomb 

And then all the scenes the famous scenes in fact from this tomb of harvest time on the right-hand side

But a tomb that 's of very modest dimensions

Menna just a fairly humble official and yet awarded by the Pharaoh this gift of a funerary monument  in the Theban necropolis 

The funerary nature of the decoration is not extensive always  uh because much of the wall space is taken with recreating the life that the official  knew while he lived in Egypt

and then  uh making sure that all activities are represented that would provide the official with food with perfume with uhm clothing everything for the afterlife 

And this is uh uhm shown quite clearly in this funerary procession

It would 've been sufficient and indeed in some tombs it does exist that these  men carry the boxes of goods on their shoulders these ornate chests inlaid with ebony and ivory 

It would be sufficient just to show the box

but in order to make it quite clear that the kind of commodities being contained in the box  the vizier of Tothmoses the Third has sh  uh required the artist to show the objects as if they 're balancing on the top in this impossible way

It is just an Egyptian convention

Well  if you look at my fingers when light is shone through them  they 're predominantly red 

And they 're predominantly red because the major absorbing  is haemoglobin  the red pigment in the blood cells 

This is the absorption spectrum of haemoglobin

Again the absorption coefficient the amount by which it absorbs light on its horizontal axis  is weighed then

I 've now re-displaced this visible region into the near infrared

There are powerful absorption bands here in between five or six hundred six hundred and fifty nanometres

These are the visible absorptions that we can spot with our eye

And if you notice the red trace the oxygenated haemoglobin has a different absorbency from the blue trace the deoxygenated haemoglobin

And it 's these changes in the absorption in the visible that give rise to the colour change that we notice

Arterial blood is bright red 

venous deoxygenated blood is a sort of bluish red 

If we try to sa send light through significant thicknesses of tissue although the water would not absorb the light haemoglobin in this region will absorb very powerfully

However if we move out into the near infrared the absorption of the haemoglobin drops dramatically 

The water absorption we know is still low and therefore in the near infrared where our eyes can't detect we might expect to get light through even thicker sections of tissue than the one centimetre of finger that you could observe from the slide cells 

And in this near infrared region if we look at the expanded scale uh diagram on the top right-hand corner again you 'll see that there is still a difference in the absorption spectrum from the oxygenated to the deoxygenated haemoglobin 

The implication of this is that if we can send light through tissues and somehow return the amount of light that 's absorbed by the oxygenated and the amount that 's absorbed by the deoxygenated haemoglobin we can measure non-invasively the oxygenation of the blood and the tissues and that our tissued brain we can measure the oxygenated blood in the brain

Is there anything else that we can measure in this near infrared region 

If we go through some very simple biochemistry because as I 'm a physicist I 've got no standing on this

When we take in foodstuffs through  carbohydrates and so on 

a series of biochemical reactions take place during the normal production of energy from these substrates  and their combination with oxygen to release energy

This is the energy-producing process that goes on within the cells of our body

I 'm not really interested in this section here

But right at the end of this chain this oxidated phosphorylated chain there is an enzyme cytochrome A A three

And this enzyme plays a key role

It  combines electrons that come from the uh reduction of foodstuff here

It combines them with oxygen to form water

And this enzyme is found within the cells in these mitochondrial membranes

It 's not in the dead blood cells

It 's actually normal for cells of our body

And  very luckily for us this abso this enzyme has an absorption spectrum that changes depending upon whether the enzyme is oxygenated or deoxygenated

This is the absorption spectrum

again absorbence against  for cytochrome A A three in its two forms solidised de-oxidized form  reduced form

It has powerful absorbencies down in the visible at six hundred nanometres

This is because it contains a 

It 's like haemoglobin

But as in the infrared here and expanded in this  here you can see there are still differences in the absorption between the oxidized and the liquid form 

If they thought by shining light through tissue we can measure the amount of oxidized and induced cytochrome we can measure the oxidation uh the oxygenation state of the tissues of the cells of the tissues

We therefore in theory  the oxygenation of the blood that 's in the brain and the oxygenation of the cells that are receiving the oxygen that will be coming from the blood 

And  this measurement of absorption is in principle bit nearer to the  that I 'll be talking about 

A technique was developed in nineteen seventy-seven by a physiologist at Duke University North Carolina called 

And he showed that he could in fact measure absorption changes across the head of a cat and the cat 's head 's about four or five centimetres diameter

This really excited us because even in  of a unit a twenty-six or twenty-seven week old premature baby has a head of about of five or six centimeters diameter

There 's very little difference

So what  could do with the cat head perhaps we could do on a baby 's head 

And we have in fact developed a range of instrumentations to do that

Now before I can start the instrumentation we need to know a little bit from maths of how we go from absorption measurement into measurement of concentrations of haemoglobin and cytochrome 

And I 'll keep the mathematics  fairly simple 

If we have a beam of light of low intensity we send it through a sample containing an absorbing material of concentration C and extinction 

this is the amount by which it absorbs light per unit of concentration B then

then

If we shine light through this cell the emerging intensity will be related to the incoming intensity by this law the  law

And if we take a log ratio of  we get the for the attenuation of the  densities

and there are three terms in it the extinction coefficient which is the absorbence on the vertical axis of those graphs that I showed you earlier concentration which is what we are interested in calculating and D the distance the light has travelled in getting through this absorbing medium 

Now  that works extremely well to clear solutions where all all the light that goes in can be detected emerging 

What happens in tissue

Tissue isn't a clear solution

Tissue is a scattering material

Light  a scattering material will emerge in  from all points on the surface

And if we have a detector over here we can only catch some of the light 

We can measure by exiting intensity and calculating attenuation

but we can't calibrate the absolute absorption that this material may exhibit unless we can somehow catch up all of the light that emerges

and if light doesn't just emerge on this side it will be back  and coming out in side front and back

It 's im impractical to measure all the scattered light and therefore we can't in fact measure absolute absorption

We can measure a relative attenuation by having a protector here and a light source here 

So it 's very difficult to measure absolute absorption

However if we had a light source and a detector then if the absorption in this material changed we would measure change in te in micro intensity here

and we could probably relate the change in intensity here to the change in concentration

So we can measure a lot of changes but probably probably not absolute absorptions 

Now 

Water

I 'm going to add an absorber Parker black Quink ink

One two three drops 

Assuming that I put the lid on before I shake it 

The light is attenuated  which is exactly what we 'd expect  from a clear solution 

But this represents tissue

This is Lord Rayleigh 's semi-skimmed milk my analogue of the neonatal brain

And the first thing that you that you can see is that in fact the intensity of the light you are detecting is really quite low

There is a significant attenuation but what I 've got in here is a scattering material

There is no absorption taking place

The reason the light is attenuated is that it 's been redistributed

It 's some of it 's coming out here

Some of it 's coming out this way

You 're only detecting a small bit of it with your eye

However as I said if we have a detector here in place of your eye we could probably measure changes in attenuation and relate them to changes in concentration of our absorber 

But what happens if we actually add the same amount of absorber to the scattering material

One two three 

Carefully measured to the microgram 

What you see is that there 's virtually no light coming out

there 's some light coming around the glass of the bottle  but although I added the same amount of absorber the attenuation is enormously higher than it was in this clear solution

Now why is that the case

Well the reason is that if I just go back one slide the attenuation that we measure is proportional to this the extension 

That 's the same for the ink I 've put in both bottles 

The concentration that 's the same

I 've put the same amount in both

But it 's also proportional to D the distance the light has travelled

Now in this clear solution the light has travelled this distance the diameter of the bottle

But in the presence of a scattering material the light has travelled a very convoluted path perhaps three or four times the distance between this side of the bottle and that side

And in travelling that extra path it 's been absorbed  by  

So if I wanted to quantitate concentration changes I not only have to measure changes in the attenuation

but I also have to know what the   is inside the scattering material 

And that problem is displayed in this graph here

Here we have our scattering material with a measure of attenuation which is a log ratio of the input intensity with the output intensity

If this was a not a scattering material then if I plotted attenuation against the amount of absorber or the absorption coefficient

doesn't matter which

if I plotted attenuation against absorption  I would expect to get a linear plot

and that 's what see here

and the slope of that would be the distance L the distance the light has travelled

So this represents what happens in a clear solution 

However this is what happens in a scattering solution

The relationship between attenuation and absorption is non-linear 

What 's even more worrying is that this non-linearity depends upon the degree of scattering

This graph has shown for an long-utterance

and this is a static  too

in both nanometres four times the static coefficient

You can see this relationship has changed totally 

However even in real tissue  what we are doing is we measure an attenuation and we 're looking for small changes in attenuation here delta A

We want to relate them to changes in absorption coefficient  delta new A because then we can plot the concentration changes if that 's 

And over a small range here we can assume that this non-linear relationship is in fact linear that there is a a short section here which is linear

The gradient of that line is the  of the light

The  that the light has travelled in getting from a ten feet protective point

It 's some multiplying factor beta times the true  between the light and the detector here 

Now if you accept for a minute that I can measure this  factor then in theory we can do some genuine measurements spectroscopic measurements across scattering materials like the  brains 

 relies therefore upon measuring the intensity of light coming out

We know the intensity we 're putting in

We assume that we lose s some light due to scattering and perhaps absorption from other materials but that there are four compounds whose absorption changes and that we can monitor and these are oxygenated and deoxygenated blood haemoglobin and oxidized and reduced cytochrome

Right

As I said earlier on in the classroom  we will now go through the basic controls on the machine 

Firstly you have your brakes 

The front brake is here on the lever  and your back brake is the foot pedal down below 

These enable you to slow down and stop the machine 

Secondly you 've got the throttle  here on the handlebars

This supplies fuel to the engine 

The more you open the throttle the more fuel will go through  the faster the machine will go

The other control you 've got  is your clutch

It 's here  on this lever

This enables you to change gear and it disengages the engine 

It 's used in conjunction  with the gear lever which is down here

It 's foot operated 

Now before we start the engines up I would like you all to go to your machines  and we will wheel them around the course so that you get the feel of them 

Right

We 're going to do this one at a time 

If you 'd like to go to your machines

and Gareth if you 'd like to lead 

Right now take the bike off its side stand and hold its weight on the handlebars 

Keep the bike leaning towards you slightly not on your hip but towards you

If you 'd like to take a right-hand circle  quite tight  quite gently

Now use the brake if necessary to stop it 

Apply it very slowly 

No not not too jerkily

That was too hard a snatch

Treat it very gently

That 's much better 

That 's it

Wheel it round 

That 's lovely

And if you go straight into a left hand circle keeping the bike leaning towards you all the time 

That 's it

Put it on full lock 

Bring it round

You 'll clear the bikes

That 's lovely

And back to its starting position 

Apply the brake very smoothly and put it back on its side stand 

That 's the way 

Lovely

There are a few important procedures to follow  before we even start the engine 

First of all we take the bike off its centre stand 

We have our foot down on the centre stand

We grab the bike and very gently pull it forwards  keeping your foot on the centre stand

Now cover the front brakes so the bike can not roll away from you 

and gently let the centre stand up

Now with your hand still on the front brake we 're going to put the bike on its side stand 

It is located here 

We swing it forward

Make sure that it 's fully locked 

and swing the bike very gently over on to its side 

You can now let go of the front brake

Now Tony we 'll just go over the basic procedures to start your bike before you sit on it 

First of all I would like you to switch on the petrol tap

This will make the fuel go through to the engine 

Secondly you turn the ignition on

Now make sure the green neutral light is showing 

This means the bike is in neutral  not in gear

Then all you need to do is use the kickstart 

This will turn the engine over

Obviously if you 've got an electric start use that

Now if the engine is in fact cold I also will want you to use the choke 

Now if you 'd like to put on you your helmet

That 's the way

And then we 'll sit you on your bike 

Make sure that the helmet is securely fastened 







The correct procedure for moving away  is firstly to pull in the clutch lever 

Then engage first gear 

Now very gradually release the clutch lever and as the engine starts to move forward  very very gently open up the throttle 

That 's all right

The bike has stalled 

we will start again

If you 'd like to engage neutral 

That 's the way

Kickstart the bike

Flick up the footrest 

That 's great

In with the clutch 

Into first gear 

Now very gently open up the throttle and the bike will start to move towards me 

That 's smashing

Keep coming

Keep coming towards me

That 's lovely

That 's smashing

OK

And stop by pulling in the brake 

Lovely

Right Tony it looks like you 've got the hang of it

Off you go and practise

Right

Who 's next

Once you 've mastered clutch control and can move off without stalling  you will then go on to learn basic manoeuvres 

And you 'll start by riding around a small circuit under close observation from your instructor who will be monitoring your progress  as you learn to control your bike

You will go through a series of basic manoeuvres  the routine of which will become the foundation of your road riding technique 

You 'll be taught the correct procedure for starting  changing gear  stopping  making a left turn  or a right turn  and how to ride your bike in simulated slow speed traffic 

Not everyone at the training sessions will be a complete novice

so don't be discouraged if you don't pick things up quite as quickly as everyone else 

You 're bound to make mistakes early on and the instructor is there to help you put them right 

Controlled braking 

The most important thing you will ever learn is how to use your brakes effectively 

The techniques will vary according to road condition and you will have to master them all 

Pulling away 

Even something as simple as this has to be learned otherwise you will never know the correct procedure 

The figure of eight course teaches you how to manoeuvre your bike 

The idea is to ride your bike around the two centre cones  without going outside or touching any of the surrounding cones 

It 's a combination of rear-wheel only braking  clutch control and of course balance 

It 's not quite as easy as it looks 

and the only way to be able to do this successfully  is with practice and concentration 

And mastering this technique can be a lot of fun 

Turning both left and right 

Again a precise sequence of looking signalling and manoeuvering has to be established 

The theory behind these manoeuvres is to give other road users clear indication of your intentions  and to teach you when to look and how to react to the varying traffic conditions 

Slow speed control 

Matching the speed of your bike to the differing pace of the instructor will show you how to handle your bike in slow-moving traffic 

On the road riding 

Once you have proved your ability to control your machine at the training centre an instructor will then take you out onto the open road 

He 'll fit your helmet with a radio receiver so he can advise and teach you actually as you ride 

As a beginner you 'll need to have an expert at hand for the first time you encounter traffic 

Take your time 

There 's no hurry 

And remember

all you 'll be doing here is putting into practice everything that you have been taught at the centre 

Once the instructor is happy with you riding quiet roads with minimal traffic  you 'll both venture out onto busier roads

How long you spend in training on the road depends on your learning abilities how much you already know and how good you actually are 

We 're riding here with our visors up as it was a very cold and humid day

The normal rule of course is to ride with your visor down whenever possible 

but on a day like this you can't really see much through a misted visor 

Your instructor will also point out many things that you haven't even thought about 

For instance potential hazards like wet leaves on the road

And above all he will teach you to look well ahead 

If you can demonstrate your ability to ride a bike safely on the road he will issue you with a certificate of validation 

Your training will continue until you are brought up to this standard 

Now your compulsory training will have taught you the very basics of how to start  how to stop and how to control your machine

and your instructor will have taken you out on the road

But there 's still lots to learn before you 're able to take your bike out into heavy traffic or indeed take the motorcycle test itself 

The kind of things I 'm talking about are key manoeuvres like turning left turning right what to do at a roundabout or a pedestrian crossing

Now practice  makes perfect

If you 're going to practise these manoeuvres then choose somewhere quiet

If you choose a  housing estate like this keep your eye open for small children  or for pedestrians who may not have their eye open for you 

All right 

Only when you are completely confident and familiar with these manoeuvres should you attempt to take your bike out into the busy road 

Now then

Let 's have a closer look at some of those manoeuvres 

Starting off

Start the bike 

Put it in gear 

Have a good look down the road 

Make a clear signal 

Look again

That 's the lifesaver

And pull away if it is clear 

Practise this sequence time and time again 

Left turn onto a main road 

Have a good look over your right shoulder 

Give a clear signal 

Alter the speed of your bike with the gears and brakes as you approach the junction 

Check the road you 're turning on to

Wait until it 's clear

Before you move off a lifesaver over the left shoulder 

A left turn off a main road 

Again look over your right shoulder

Indicate  and as you approach the junction adjust your speed looking all the time 

A lifesaver over the left for a left turn

And off you go 

Parked cars and pedestrians  a potentially hazardous situation

Adjust your speed accordingly 

Don't be afraid to cross the white line to avoid children running out or car doors from opening 

Now this car coming up behind me is getting closer  so I 'm making my intentions more than clear  and acting early

Don't be intimidated by vehicles following too close behind 

Making a right turn off a main road

Look behind 

Indicate 

A lifesaver before you make a decisive move towards the centre of the road 

Keep the indicator going

And if all is clear a lifesaver

and cross the road 

Here 's another right turn

but under more hazardous conditions

Again there are two separate parts to this manoeuvre 

The first part will take you to the centre of the road  and the second part will take you through the turn itself 

In a situation like this  where your path may be blocked by oncoming traffic wait in a fixed position at the centre of the road looking all around and giving a clear signal

You are in a very vulnerable position here

There may be cars passing you from behind  and the possibility of pedestrians too 

Don't be tempted to rush out of the way 

Wait until there is a clear gap in the traffic  and move off decisively and only then 

If there 's any doubt  wait

This is a typical high street full of potential hazards 

This pedestrian may step out 

This car turning onto the road ahead  may pull dangerously wide and cross your path 

And those cars ahead are braking

It 's important to be able to predict way in advance so you have time to prepare accordingly 

A motorcyclist should always ride defensively 

Here are some more hazards 

This parked security van may be hiding crossing children 

These pedestrians may not have seen you at all and could rush out 

Other road users do take chances and you might have to avoid them 

This pick-up may choose to turn right across your path 

Generally motorbikes aren't as visible as cars and their speed is more difficult to estimate 

Many road users aren't even looking for motorbikes in particular 

And of course as a learner you should be extra careful 

Overtaking can be a very dangerous manoeuvre 

First of all passing a stationary vehicle that is blocking your path 

The procedure is very simple and will be familiar by now

Look behind 

Indicate

Position yourself near the centre of the road 

And if your path is blocked  wait 

And only when it 's clear look behind with a lifesaver  and go

And once you 're past the parked vehicle pull over quickly to your side of the road 

Overtaking a moving vehicle is more dangerous 

Assess the amount of clear road there is ahead in relationship to the speed of the vehicle you 're going to pass 

Anticipate any change of course or speed of that vehicle

And is there enough room to pull in front of it 

Weigh up all these factors carefully before you commit yourself to the manoeuvre 

The easiest way to remember correct roundabout procedure is to think of it as a crossroads with an island in the middle 

Your approach to it would be the same as the way you would approach a crossroads depending whether you were going straight across or turning left or right 

There are various types of roundabout from the  roundabout to more complex ones with traffic lights on them

but your approach and procedure should always be the same 

Give way to traffic immediately on the right 

And once you 're on the roundabout you will have right of way

But again as a motorcyclist you 'll have to be careful of cars pulling across you 

And before you exit give a good clear indication 

Here 's some general advice on how to use roundabouts 

When turning left  a lifesaver before you enter the roundabout

Keep going if it 's clear

You don't have to stop

And a lifesaver as you exit 

When going straight ahead at a roundabout use the centre lane 

Don't indicate left until you 've passed the first exit

And again that all-important lifesaver 

When turning right on a roundabout  approach in the right-hand lane indicating right 

Hug the inside of the roundabout 

Pass the first exit

And as you pass the second exit  indicate left

Lifesaver

Manoeuvre left

Lifesaver

And leave the roundabout

This car has a hard act to follow

The old B M W three series was highly successful

and the new one keeps the same proven formula  still rear-wheel drive

and it has a similar range of engines  from one point eight to two point five litres 

It 's slightly longer taller and wider than the old one with better aerodynamics  and a new rear suspension 

The weight distribution has been improved with a much more even balance between front and rear  which has helped achieve better road holding and that 's an area in which the old three series was sometimes criticised 

The new one goes on sale in Britain next month 

Anyone drawing up a shortlist of the best cars in the world would just have to include this one

It 's Mercedes ' new S class and it certainly sets fresh standards in luxury car motoring 

It 's an amazingly opulent car

All sorts of electronic gadgetry

The seat belts automatically adjust themselves to your shoulder height

All four seats have memory devices 

It comes with a range of engines up to a new six litre V twelve which propels this two-ton motorcar at over a hundred and fifty miles an hour 

Now Mercedes have always been good at insulating their car but they 've gone a stage further with this 

The windows are double-glazed 

There are two layers of glass with a three millimetre gap in between them

That has obvious advantages in cutting down heat loss  in reducing noise and also in stopping the car misting up in the winter 

Now if you 're one of those people who 's ever complained late at night of the neighbours returning home and slamming their car doors you 'll wish they had one of these  because this car if you just push the doors to  they automatically close themselves 

Mercedes have always been at the forefront of luxury car design and this car is clearly aimed at keeping them there 

But the European manufacturers face increasing competition from the Japanese with cars like Toyota 's Lexis muscling in 

Well now the Japanese are trying harder in the executive car market as well  and Mitsubishi 's new Sigma is priced directly to compete with B M W 's five series 

Jeremy Clarkson has been trying out the Sigma in the Alps

Thermoplastic olefin bumpers  autochanger  trace control  slip control  traction control  overdrive  four I S independent suspension  E C S 

Bamboozled

Well so was I 

I 've just spent a week trying to unravel the Mitsubishi Sigma possibly the most technologically complicated car I 've ever come across 

For twenty-six thousand pounds you 're lucky to get windows as standard in a B M W 

but the Sigma which has to compete for a slice of the executive action  without much in the way of badge prestige has to rely on something else 

To that end it has a three-litre twenty-four valve V six engine which develops two hundred and two brake horsepower 

It drives the front wheels through an automatic gearbox

and who said they were labour-saving

This has power and economy ratios as well as overdrive 

And this is by far the best behaved interior yet to emerge from Japan 

The only questionable piece of taste must be this button-backed upholstery 

And also for such a large car it doesn't feel quite as spacious inside in here as it should 

But the toys are great

I 've got cruise control powered seats with memory air conditioning and the most fantastically complicated stereo 

There 's the usual radio and cassette player gubbins

but there 's a C D too with its own autochanger in the boot 

And if that 's not enough it has a wacky graphic equaliser as well 

The end result of all these bits and bobs is a dash that you get the distinct impression  would not look all that out of place in the pointy bit of a Seven Four Seven 

But there 's more to this car than simple creature comforts 

a lot more 

and it all starts with this 

Port electronically controlled suspension

A driver can raise the car which is useful in conditions like these  or engage sport mode which drags the car down on its haunches  giving it a torque stance through the bends

It 's clever stuff 

Although the Sigma does without proper active four-wheel steering as seen on the Galant  there 's what 's called passive rear-wheel steer 

Mind you its worth is somewhat negated by vague power steering 

But this car 's pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance de rsistance what sets it aside from B M Ws and Mercs and so on is its traction control system 

Now this is all a bit complicated

so you 'll have to bear with me cos it incorporates not only slip control  but also what Mitsubishi are calling trace control 

What happens is one of ten computers on board constantly monitors the amount of steering lock I apply how much grip is available and how fast I 'm going 

If it decides I 'm going too fast a large boxing glove springs out of the steering wheel and punches me in the face 

No I 'm only kidding

What actually happens is it throttles back

It decides how fast I go around the corner 

I don't 

Disengage the system

and cornering is a wild experience as the tyres scrabble to overcome my youthful exuberance 

But when the system is on even with my foot hard down in second gear  cornering is relaxed and safe much to the relief of oncoming traffic 

It 's the same deal when setting off on a slippery surface

With the traction control turned off there 's lots of noise and fuss but when it 's on after a brief flurry while the computer sorts itself out the car sets off as though it 's on a perfectly dry road 

Now all this stuff undoubtedly makes the Sigma a very safe proposition in difficult conditions 

but what about the three hundred and sixty-four days a year when it isn't snowy 

The engine 's pretty good

It pulls with not a hint of roughness and top speed for the record is a hundred and forty miles an hour

And yes it does have a catalytic converter 

However it 's not a fun car to drive not like a B M W anyway 

The steering is just too vague

and I 'm still not convinced that two hundred horsepower and front-wheel drive  make desperately happy bedfellows 

trace control or no 

Two questions remain 

Why does it look like an old N S U R O Eighty  and who on earth called it Stigma  sorry Sigma 

Briefly then the Sigma makes sensible use of its technology  it cruises very well and it comes with a three-year warranty 

Countering that it has a bland appearance

It has no prestige  and the steering is simply much too light 

It has a catalytic converter though as standard and therefore has to run on unleaded petrol

There was a time when the man who bought an off-road vehicle had a piece of straw in his mouth 

Today more often than not he has a plum 

The utilitarian jobs of yesteryear have shaken off their country bumpkin outfits and most these days  wear city suits 

It 's no longer any good offering cars that can only perform off-road

As the top models now have Jaguar-style price tags they must have Jaguar-style luxury too 

Make no mistake

their off-road ability remains undiminished but their appeal these days is lodged firmly among people for whom the idea of going off-road  involves driving into a puddle 

Here we have the latest version of the car that virtually killed off Land Rover in Africa 

Despite its reputation for ruggedness elsewhere in the world  the only long wheelbase version imported into Britain is the range topping crumpet truck 

This is the Toyota Landcruiser and the whole thing revolves around big numbers 

It 's got a four point two litre turbo-charged six cylinder diesel engine 

It 's sixteen feet long six feet high six feet wide 

And the big numbers spill over into the interior as well 

I wish someone would explain to the Japanese that we don't measure luxury by how many buttons there are 

I 've got two for the differential locks two for the electric aerial two for the sunshine roof 

I must say that when this car rolled up I was determined to hate it

It 's big and brash with its white letter tyres and tacky upholstery 

sort of automotive equivalent of a pair of white socks

You get the impression if you turned up for a day 's shooting the pheasants 'd die laughing 

But I 've done a couple of hundred miles in it now

and I 'm  I 'm getting really rather fond of it

It has an earthy feel about it which I like

It has a reasonable turn of speed and it handles with great adroitness for such a leviathan 

The steering 's a vast improvement over the old model and so driving it on normal roads is by no means unpleasant 

Even so you 're constantly aware that no matter how much it pretends to be a Jaguar  its abilities are more in line with those of a tractor 

Well I wouldn't like to have to do this in a miniskirt 

Not that I 've got a miniskirt you understand 

Now the Mercedes is the other way around

The hideous exterior looks might lead you to think that it 's a tractor

but the innards 

well

they suggest otherwise

I know these pale colours are all very well for people but I think the sheep might muck it up a bit 

As opposed to the Toyota which in its latest form is only imported as an eight-seater diesel

you can have the G Wagon as a long or short wheelbase with petrol or diesel power 

A word of warning though

It 's impossible to fit a turbo-charger to right-hand drive diesel models

and that makes them 

well let 's be kind

let 's say sluggish 

Now the petrol engines are much better 

This is a three litre six

now as you 'd imagine it 's smooth and quiet and refined and blessed with perfectly reasonable levels of performance 

As before there are locking differentials and low ratio gears  but the new versions now have full time four-wheel drive and better suspension 

It looks the same though

The biggest change superficially at least is in here

All of these trim pieces appear to have been taken from fifty or sixty thousand pound Mercedes saloons 

and of course gives an immense feeling of quality

And of course it 's all beautifully screwed together 

Now the thing is is that when you 're in any Mercedes from the smallest one ninety up to the biggest coup&eacute; you can't help  metaphorically looking down on other motorists 

When you 're in a G Wagon  you 're actually looking down on them 

If you want to buy one of these to use primarily as a road car  fine

They both offer a load of advantages over say a  Jaguar saloon

You sit up high

That gives you a great view of the road

There 's tons of space

They 're great for towing 

And of course the weather can do pretty much what it wants and you 'll still be mobile 

Disadvantages

Well they 're not exactly aerodynamic so the fuel bills are pretty big 

And the suspension is designed for off-road use and it makes it a bit bouncy on the road 

Now choosing between the Mercedes and the Toyota is more difficult 

Although they 're designed to do the same job they both differ in terms of style

so really it 's a personal choice 

And anyway they both have a big  big problem 

The Range Rover is warming up for its twenty-first birthday this summer but even so in terms of sales in Britain at least  it knocks the competition into a cocked hat 

Not only is it more stylish

you can see the Queen turning up in one for instance

but it 's more elegant in here too

All the wood and leather combines with all the latest toys the  automatic dipping rear-view mirror the electric seats and so on 

And of course this is the only one here to have a V eight engine 

And now for nineteen ninety-one comes another big change 

Land Rover have fitted anti-roll bars 

Wow

No honestly it 's big news 

In the past if a dog or a chicken or something ran out into the road and you had to take avoiding action  early Range Rovers used to roll around and give the impression they weren't really going to change direction at all 

Well this new model handles much much better 

And Land Rover say the new rollbars haven't affected its wheel articulation 

something that 's made the Range Rover so good off-road in the past 

As far as I can work out they haven't harmed ride comfort either 

Be in no doubt that the Range Rover is the best off-roader you can buy even at thirty-four thousand pounds for this Vogue S E 

The Landcruiser is seven thousand pounds less while a similarly equipped G Wagon is a staggering ten thousand pounds more

Hardly surprising people don't take them off-road 

We did though 

Not so long ago the Range Rover led its competition by about  oh by about that much 

But as we 've seen off-road and on it the gap 's getting quite narrow now

It must be down to about  oh about that I should say

OK

Uhm I want to talk to you today just for ten minutes about the laryngograph which is a device that we use  uh in measuring voice 

Uhm and first of all I just want to to tell you a little bit about what I 'm going to say so I can uhm structure the time

So first of all my aim today really is to make sure that you understand how the laryngograph works and that you see a little bit about its role in clinical research 

So what we 're going to do is to go through  the different sections

first of all why we would actually use something like the laryngograph 

secondly how it actually works 

third what it shows us 

and fourth I 'm going to show you some example traces and then talk a little bit about an application of the device in my research work 

OK

So first of all why do we use it 

Well  we 're interested in looking at voice production because the majority of the time we spend speaking we actually do spend voicing so we actually use our voice 

And it 's OK to look at it with making speech measurements with a microphone

but it 's much more useful if we can somehow get a direct measurement right from the larynx without  everything else superimposed on that information

So we want some kind of direct physical measure

We also need something that is non-invasive so that we can do it on anybody children adults people who have disorders of some description

So something that 's non-invasive doesn't involve having an anaesthetic for example  and something that 's harmless and repeatable so that we can do measurements several times a day many days in a row for example 

And lastly we need something that doesn't actually interfere with speech production itself 

Uhm if we had something that went in the mouth or up the nose and and down the mouth back of the mouth to look at the larynx which they do do  uhm then that would actually interfere with your ability to speak and then we 're not going to be measuring real speech we 're going to be measuring some strange interfered speech 

So  we choose the device called a laryngograph

and I want to just describe to you a little bit about how it actually works 

It 's based around a pair of gold-plated electrodes 

And these electrodes are just placed on either side of the the cartilage in the neck the larynx 

So  they 're just placed on either side and they can be secured with a neckband  so that the subject can hopefully forget about them  after a few minutes

They don't have their hands tight round their neck all the time 

So the gold-plated electrodes are used

And the electrodes pass a very small current 

One electrode sends out a current and the other electrode picks up that current  and so then we can plot how the current flows across the larynx 

And I 'll show you the type of current flow that we get in different situations 

OK

First of all  OK

First of all I 'm going to show you three different postures of the vocal folds 

So first of all in quiet breathing here we have the cartilage of the larynx and one electrode placed on either side

So this is the front  and this is the back so i it 's kind of looking at a section through the neck

And you can see that the vocal folds are here in red 

And these little cartilages at the back actually move the vocal folds when they 're going to be vibrating

So for quiet breathing there 's a gap between the folds so that the air can come out through them and out to produce speech 

During voicing they have one of two different extreme postures

They 're either  separated so that the air can flow out and we call that the open phase  or they 're actually closed together and we call that the closed phase 

And they actually work through a cycle of vibrations

so if we imagine them starting together then they 'll peel apart fairly slowly

and then they kind of snap back shut again

So they have the open phase and the closed phase 

Now if we plot the current flow with a laryngograph what we find  is that we get this characteristic waveform

So we 're going to draw a  plot of current flow against time

Now when the vocal folds are open if you remember back  to this this one here then what we can see is that the current can only flow really around the outsides

It doesn't flow happily across that air gap between the vocal folds

So that means when we plot current flow on an axis we have to plot it  at a minimum

There we see a minimum current flow when the folds are open 

As the vocal folds start to close what we find is that the current flow actually increases quite dramatically until when they 're fully closed

it reaches a peak 

and then as they peel apart the current flow drops again

and then finally when they 're fully apart it 's completely  back down to its minimum value

So we have this cycle of the vocal folds closing  closed opening and open

And we see that happening for every single vibration over time

So we have this idea of how well they 're closing and opening

but we also have an idea of how many times they close and open per second 

so we can work out the frequency or the pitch of the voice as well 

So just to summarize that then

the laryngograph shows us some information about how the vocal folds actually make contact  whether they make contact with just a small portion of them and we have low current flow or whether the fat vocal folds actually make complete contact and we have a high current flow 

And they also show us the stages in the cycle of vibration 

So I 'll just show you some examples  of different traces 

So this is going to focus on some different voice qualities

I 'm going to show you four voice qualities  first of all the normal voice which is what I 'm producing hopefully at the moment then some very breathy voice some creaky voice and some falsetto 

Managed it today 

OK

So  here are some examples of traces

If we just look at the first one  OK we have the laryngograph trace at the bottom

And you 're familiar with just the one cycle

Here is several cycles over time 

And we have a signal that 's measured with a microphone a speech signal at the top

So you can see for normal voice that we have this sharp closing of the vocal folds and then a slower opening and a small open phase 

If we look at much more breathy voice then we find that we have a closing and opening but a much longer open phase

so there 's a lot more chance for the air to actually escape during phonation 

And for very creaky voice which is very irregular creak then we have closing sharp closing but then a much much slower opening phase and a a fairly long open phase as well

and also we have sort of irregular vibration as you look over time

And lastly for falsetto the the cords are very stretched and thin to produce this kind of voice quality 

so we find that we have a very small contact  very very many contacts over a period of time  and that gives us this high frequency high pitch  voice that we perceive as falsetto 

So let me now just talk a little bit about an application

And one application one thing that we 've been using in research and now is actually being used in speech therapy clinics  is the fact that we can actually listen as well as look at the laryngograph signal 

And if I just play you a little example of this what we can do is take the signal that we 're measuring at the larynx  and actually put that signal direct to an amplifier and play it out of a speaker

So if I

So you can hear pitch changes  you can hear the voicing sort of switching on and off so if I whisper it disappears altogether

But if I voice the voice comes back 

But what you can't hear is any of the vowels and consonants that we hear in speech and that 's because they 're all created from the larynx upwards

The larynx has nothing to do really with that 

So what we can do in fact I 'll just turn it off  is to use that signal to train people 's ability to perceive voicing  distinctions in speech  and their ability to actually produce them

And one group that we 've been working with are those who are deaf or very very profoundly deaf  who really have very minimal hearing and have trouble picking up voicing distinctions and distinctions in voice pitch in different speakers

and they have problems actually producing them themselves 

So we can use this auditory signal

We can feed it through a hearing aid

and we can train them to listen specifically  for when the voicing is there or not and for when the pitch changes are there or not

So let me just see if I can give you a little test 

I 'm going to produce  two sounds

I 'm going to produce a rising sound and a falling sound

Just have a listen 

OK 

Now I 'm going to do one and I want you to tell me whether it 's going up or down

OK

I 'm going to turn around

Yep

OK

OK

OK

Good

You all pass 

So you do those kinds of exercises with the subjects to see if they can actually perceive the differences in pitch

And we can do that with female speakers and male speakers and children  to see how well they can perceive pitch differences

And then we can also use the same feedback to help them to produce those kind of pitch changes in their speech 

And one characteristic of deaf speech is it tends to be very very monotone so we can actually work on that 

And it 's much easier for them to to hear how well they 're doing if they have this direct feedback 

OK

So just to summarize then 

The laryngograph provides us with a very accurate non-invasive physical measure of voice 

It allows us to look at voice quality by looking at the waveforms 

And it also allows us to look at and measure voice pitch in speakers 

And one application that I talked to you about today is that we can use this in working with the deaf on their perception and their production of voice pitch 

And next week I 'll talk to you a little bit about how we can use the device working with dysphonic patients patients with voice disorders 

Thank you

So it shows us about vocal fold contact

and it shows us about the cycle of vibration how the vocal folds come together and go apart 

And I 'll show you some examples from four different voice qualities for some of which I will attempt to mimic but with my cold I may not manage it 

So the first one to look at is the top one  where we have

this is just a speech waveform measured with a microphone 

And then this is the trace from these electrodes with the laryngograph 

And what you can see is that for a succession of something like a vowel like then the vocal folds vibrate many many many times per second

Each one of these is about ten milliseconds ten thousandths of a second 

And we can see that for normal vibration the vocal folds snap together quite quickly 

and then they peel apart a little more slowly

and they 're apart just for a short  period of time 

And each snapping together causes one excitation in the speech waveform 

If we have something like very breathy voice like with lots of air flow  then what happens is the vocal folds close and open as they do above

but they 're open for a much longer period of time and hence the the perception of lots of air flowing out 

Uhm

if we have some very creaky voice which would be with very irregular vibration which is my voice is tending to today  then you have the vocal folds closing and then opening very very slowly 

and also they have sort of irregular closings and openings

It 's not nice and regular as it is with normal speech

Uhm now  what you 've got here is very simple

Uh behind this this complex imagery which will take quite some time to go through uhm you 've also got the uhm idea of uh y got one simple idea

It 's greed and self-interest or private interest that has caused the collapse

It 's all these vices uhm  uh 

You look at F E for instance wherever E is

Uhm

that tells you honour and honesty are crimes

and they 're published by self-interest and villainy 

Uhm so in other words  it 's very crude in its moral point but very complex and rich in its imagery

And there is uh uh the sort of level of humour

You 've got Monument which is in effect a kind of take-off of the uhm monument to the Great Fire of London

And this monument here was erected in memory of the s destruction of the City by the South Sea uh Islands in fact not by fire but by speculation 

Uhm so it 's a c typical attack on speculation of the period

uhm

no individuals referred to

it appears uhm

and again uh done according to a crowd scene as well

And this is one of the characteristics of earlier uh caricature

Now you 'll notice as caricature progresses in the eighteenth century it does tend but not universally to move away from the crowd scene a little bit more towards the simple uh simpler or less complex images

but not universally 

Uhm

and you can also see that the the caricature quite early on in England tends to divide itself  uh quite naturally between on the one hand uh political caricature caricature addressing specific political issues uhm and then caricatures that 're attacking taste 

Uh the distinction that Mrs George makes is between political and social satires

But of course it 's you can't always work it out as quite often the two mingle

In fact one ways one of the ways of getting a a good comic effect is to combine the sort of fashion plate with political caricature 

And here this is an attack on taste of the town

And again you notice the crowd scenes the relatively small figures

And again still in the seventeen twenties

and we 're talking now about seventeen twenty-four

you 've still got here the uh reference to mythology

Uhm in this case  uhm you 've the satyrs

What do satyrs mean when you see them in caricature 

What do satyrs signify 

No

Well it 's a metaphor for lust  I suppose

It 's also uhm  it also can uh it 's often used to uh as a kind of mythical origin of satire

Satyr play uhm which again is uh ancient Greek satyr plays are often thought to be one of the origins of satire 

Uhm  and there you 've got uh the the notion of of the taste of the town  and the bad taste  uh represented everywhere

Now you 've got no uh physiognomies

uh physiognomies aren't actually distorted but you do notice that dress is often used to signify different social class here

Uhm there you 've got the fops gentlemen 

Uhm and there is satire on an individual this time

Uhm  this is in fact a satire on the Earl of Burlington  uhm and in particular William Kent

And from the  Kent you 'll know was a rather a bad painter

And the joke here is that there is Kent on this pinnacle or this portico and there are Michelangelo and Raphael paying homage to him

Mm 

And so it 's a whole sort of compendium of bad taste

Uhm amo

among the bad taste it 's really foreign taste is the

Underlying this is an attack on foreign taste

Now when you get a caricature like this it may seem at first sight to be very generalized and in one sense it is but in fact in this case we can begin to see that it 's aimed at particular parties uh and belongs to a particular debate

And the particular debate here is whether the uhm  whether in fact foreign uhm  well I suppose forms of art are superior to the native ones or whether one should regard them as interlopers

And the question has raised several points

There for instance you 've got uhm  of Italian architecture being uh set up in triumph

There you 've got Italian opera

And I suppose these uhm harlequin plays are Italian or Italianate

Masquerades are thought of as vaguely foreign

And there is uh  uh someone throwing out uhm a waste paper seller saying waste paper uh for shops

And then it 's got there the works of Shakespeare Ben Jonson and all the great English authors

So it is really uhm part of the debate between uhm native talent and foreign talent

It 's also uhm ten years on from the debate between the uhm sort of like the virtue of the uh people who work in the city and the uhm  aristocracy who are in the habit of going on a grand tour and going to Italy 

Uhm

but again nothing that you could quite call caricature in the strict sense

Again physiognomies are not really large enough to be individualised in any sort of way

But there 's certainly an exaggeration of the figures of people in the uh Italian opera

And there you 've got a sort of foppishness arguably

This sort of of free stance is very caricatured

There you 've got people who are saying please pray accept eight thousand pounds which again is a satire on aristocratic uh taste and people pouring money on castrato singers in in in this period 

Uhm these I suppose are recognisable

They 're most possibly meant to be individuals

But most of it is uhm terribly generalized 

Now one of the things that begins to happen I think in the seventeen seventies  in particular is the uh  is the caricaturist that picks on particular individuals and presents a kind of unrelenting uh sort of repetition of a particular way of looking at them uhm a particular image of them if you like 

And you can take a modern examples of this like uhm you know  Richard Nixon 's five-o'clock shadow or whatever

All these things come to stand in

I mean I s I saw  a newspaper caricature of somebody which simply showed his sort of his shadow and it was Nixon 

Uhm and this notion of one single idea standing in for the personality

This in fact is  quite a witty caricature by James Sayers uhm

and it 's  called The Mask uhm

and it 's in fact the joke here is that this represents the what was felt to be a by the Opposition at least to be a a dangerous coalition between Charles James Fox  uh and Lord North 

And there is uhm  uh  Fox on this side half a fox

Uhm and of course the other part of the joke is that there is a sort of uhm  suggestion that the unity of the two is a mask as well  a doubtful unity

But you notice the way that Fox is caricatured almost as a kind of again the sort of hooded eyes  unkempt hair and again this sense of stubble everywhere

And the point about the stubble is not just that he was swarthy

but  it suggests that he spent all his nights gambling and  carousing  which was certainly an image he himself  wanted to portray

Now this is in fact specific political satire directed against  uh quite topically against the events of of of the day

So it 's a different sort of thing  uhm from anything we 've seen except possibly the Townsend  Recruiting Sergeant

This is if anything more topical

This is not just a attacking the the personalities but also the particular coalition of this time

And this is also true  of uhm this  uh quite famous caricature of Carlo Name 's Triumphant Entry into Leadenhall Street 

And this is again by Sayers

You notice Sayers 's uh mostly etching lines very spindly very free etching lines  suggesting something that was probably done very quickly and topically

And this is thought to have had a damaging effect on  uhm  the uh on uhm Fox 's reputation

uhm it shows him as someone who is trying to hijack  uhm the East India Company  uhm and he 's sort of seen as a kind of Carlo Name kind of Indian potentate

And that 's Lord North and that 's Burke  uhm again all trying to hijack  the East India Company

And you 'll notice if you look at  uh how naturally Fox takes on this role and how uh his sort of large belly is exaggerated

And again you notice the swarthiness 

And the effect of all this of course meant that there was an immediate shorthand and you can recognise things

Now this is coming comes into the repertory of caricature I think in the seventeen seventies this use of a kind of single shorthand element

I mean there 's no question about this being  caricature

This is  someone being caricatured and also someone who 's seen and represented as something else  or someone else in this case 

Now Fox a again

one of the things you can we looked at

if you remember we looked at the index  to Mrs George and it became very clear I think that Fox was the subject of an immense number of caricatures  particularly in the eighties  and nineties

And he comes back again and again

And Gillray picks him up 

And this is a French Revolutionary satire which tells uh projects as it were the fate of the British government uh if the French were to invade  in seventeen ninety-three 

And the argument is as it were that if the French invade they will put  uhm Charles James Fox into power

He 's seen uh running a kind of uhm uh French type  uhm Committee of Public Safety or a sort of French tribunal uhm uh and trying Pitt

Pitt is seen as again rather wittily as a kind of angelic figure in his nightshirt 

Uhm and these are various  members of the Whig Opposition

And there you 've got the audience the jury this time of uhm humble tradesmen thought to be the  uh foundation of the members of the London Corresponding Society 

Now here again you see Fox uh you 've got the same way of depicting Fox that we 've seen with Sayers essentially

Uhm very jowly  uhm slightly crazed eyes this time and  again the sort of unshaven quality

He 's shown to be on the one side as an aristocrat and gentleman  this is the gentlemen the other as a kind of Jacobin sans culotte  pseudo proletarian

This one looks like a revolutionary

The aim of it all is of course to discredit him and to discredit him as the Wh the Whig Opposition which again was the respectable Opposition to tar them with the brush of being uh murderous uhm followers of Robespierre

There is some irony I think in showing him as a sort of saintly figure

But even Pitt again is reduced to a highly distinctive kind of image

Uhm the the tendency is for Pitt to be depicted  as if his face forms a kind of arrow point 

Again a very receding chin and often an almost continuous line uh from his forehead to his nose 

I mean no one could look quite like that and that sort of thing is in some sense true  of Charles James Fox 

But but again the wit is that the resemblance is unmistakeable

You couldn't possibly doubt that it was Fox 

And that 's part of the skill of caricature 

uhm

then sometimes even in

this is in the seventeen nineties

you still get quite elaborate set pieces

but you notice that they 're no longer  uhm episodic in the kind of way the earlier ones are

You you 've got all of this  over here

This is rather like a classical composition  and it 's worth remembering  that uhm that Gillray was a fully-trained Royal Academy  artist 

And he was probably thinking here  uh of Hogarth 's composition called Before Phoenix 

And part of one of uh the things Gillray does so often I think in caricature partly I think because of his Royal Academy training 

he does use a lot of models 

He perverts if you like sort of high art  quite often

And you can see there 's a clear reference to which again adds another level of with a clear reference perhaps to either of Raphael 's  uhm or of the Raphael cartoons The Trial of St Paul or alternatively Hogarth 's version 

And that again makes for another level of wit 

And so you probably again in terms of audience of things that are quite uh entertaining and  a lot of people will recognise Fox and Pitt  uhm but to get the whole richness of the the wit of uhm some of the points here you 'd have to  know your history of art

in other words we 're in the the world of collecting perhaps 

So the levels if you like of potential absorption of these images 

Uhm

and this one is uh Temperance Enjoying a Frugal Meal 

And this is one of Gillray 's uhm more entertaining  caricatures of the Royal Family

And possibly the skill and  uh success of the caricaturist is to establish  uh an image of somebody uhm in a very striking way

Uhm George the Third comes out as uh looking extremely simple-minded extremely jowly 

Uhm and he for reasons that are unknown uh Gillray seems to have had it in for Charlotte Queen Charlotte  who 's always seen as hideously ugly 

And  uh again it 's a satire I suppose on the ordinariness of George the Third

He 's dressed as a king but his actual manners are satirised  uhm and his meanness as well 

But I think in many ways the best example that I can think of of the satirical method in uh in in Gillray particularly indeed in the whole of the eighteenth century  is really this one 

Because what 's I think

Well I mean that 's 

Let 's think here about its relationship to high art

It 's an attack on the Prince of Wales  shown as a voluptuary under the horrors of digestion

Do you want to just come round 

Now the thing to remember is that for changing any information you want it 's the format that 's F eight

You can't see from there

Come on  

It 's format OK which is really the critical thing

So if you just go shift and F eight  we can change

Basically we 'll just look at line and page cos those are the two critical things

So let 's just look at line

So you just press number one to get line

Now I 've changed the line

What we can do we can change hyphena nation hyphenation but don't bother

We can change justification as to whether we want to have left or right justified or not

Most of the time we have that on the full justification because we want to have a nice neat boundary either side

Some people prefer to only have left justification

so the right end is jagged like a proper typed piece of paper

but nowadays most people actually want the words spread out the page going to the edge of each boundary

Do you know what I mean



So 

You can change whether you want line numbering or not whether you want to put it on which is pretty extreme

I can't imagine anybody wants to do that but line spacing one or two spaces you know double spaced or not

Well this is the when you talk about margins

Now you might find that there are different units

This is in centimetres

It could be in inches

It could even be in word processing units

You don't really want to change that  cos you 'll have to change your machine

So note what the sizes are

But you can easily change it

Say if you went if you wanted to change that all you have to do is type in seven and then you can put any number you want

Three

It 's now at three

OK

Or you can take it out and make it two again as I want and then it goes down to the other uhm margins

So we can change any margins we like

We can also change the tab settings by pressing number eight

And every time you see an L is where there is a tab set 

What you can do is just eradicate the whole lot

You can I mean I could take them out each one at a time by moving along and then just editing editing it out and deleting it or I can just basically delete the whole line

And then where do I want to put a tab set

Perhaps six centimetres

I just type in six and then it goes there

If I want twelve just type in twelve 

And now each tab setting will go to those positions whenever I press that 

OK

And then when you 've finished it 's just exit and you 're back

So to go into line we can change things like the line margins and the tab set and you can put in whatever you like to make it sensible uhm if you 're going to do any tables 

Let 's do format again

see if I 've

If we want to get change type in number two we can change whether in fact we have margins at the top and the bottom whereas line is setting the margins on the actual page left or right

this can now set the margins at the top and the bottom of the page sort of 

But it 'll also uhm page  if you like uh and so forth

but uhm that 's essentially I think what you 're after

So it 's just F eight format and that will get you into that

Is there anything else like will you need to use uhm superscripts you know C O two

Subscripts

will you use those

Again that just comes under font

I 'll come out of this

If perhaps I put something like uhm C O two yeah 

That 's C O two and I wanted to have the two at the bottom as a as a subscript

what you have to do is you have to highlight that the area you want the thing you want to change

We just make it

we just do block 

 I set the computer up  upside down

Uhm OK fine 

That 's highlighted now with block

If I then go to font 

Let me do it this way and I can actually see what I 'm doing

Right 

All right I get block and then font

Change in size

just do size and then you can have superscript subscript whatever you like

We just put s subscript there to make it small

We could actually have superscript if you wanted power

So you just type number two

Now you can't see anything because it 's embedded but what happens when that 's printed out that 'll be printed out as a  subscript as opposed to 

So all it is basically is just block to highlight the actual feature or the number and then it 's the font or alt F eight  to actually bring that up

Now I I don't think you need anything else cos everything else is preset

So as long as you just use the format key F eight you should be able to change anything you like on that 

So come back next week if there 's anything in particular that you still haven't mastered yet



Yeah

And then you just  go back to  format

You should have you should change it especially having tables for example



The tables are probably the biggest problem because don't forget you do this 

and if you 're not careful when you then transfer the file to the printer you 'll have to reset or redo the format because it 'll be actually at the default settings

So you 'll you 'll set the table up as you like it and then take your save it on a floppy disk take it to the printer and you 'll find it won't print out exactly because it 's back at the default setting

So you 'll have to change it twice one at the computer you 're working at when you save the file and then you 'll have to redo it when you actually you go to print it out

And  just to show you some examples of that uh  uh this is this is just a a a photo of a typical observatory

This one 's on  and the telescope on the right is the William Herschel four point two metre and that 's the telescope used to obtain these informations

This is just uh these are promo shots really

And uh it 's a bit too light in here actually

Anyway uh this is

Is it possible to have a bit less light it doesn't  rea

it doesn't really matter but uh 

OK

Uh this is a typical round uh planetary nebula uh 

You can see the central star towards the centre uh 

This is an elliptical planetary 

Uh you can see uh uh density enhancements uh uh sort of uh north uh top top top right uh bottom left 

And this is uh a more extreme uh butterfly  planetary 

And this is uh probably one of the more most extreme

Uhm you can perhaps just see a a big 

But if you take a deeper exposure of this uh this object you 'll see uh faint lobes extending  right down here 

And uh it must be pointed out that uh the morphologies of these are rather uh uh wavelength dependent

This is uh one certain wavelength in the in the optical

but if we look at it in a different uh uh different frequency range you can see that what appeared to be a fairly simple uh circular P N is now a P N with an apparent jet 

And just just just to wrap up uh this is a this is a P N

Uh if you look at the uh centre this is one of the first known P Ns discovered in uh I don't know uh eighteen hundred or so and it 's called the helix nebula for obvious reasons

The scale of that is about twenty arc seconds

If you take a long deep exposure you 'll find that its structure uh changes quite dramatically

The previous picture was in the central uh over-exposed region

Uh  and right 

I think I would just uh  like to finish by saying that uh  uh  work is has shown that uh 

Yeah uh 

This is where I get stuck because I  won't have time 

Uh  yeah

That 'd that 'd be about it I think  cos the imaging of planetaries is 

Well

The reason for a wound model is that we don't wish to  invade human  material too often

That is we don't wish to take biopsies every time we want to look at a how a wound is healing

and neither do we want to use animals for this work because animals are expensive and I don't like using animals anyway

However  we need to look at how the cells act in a wound under cert under definite certain circumstances

so we 've developed a means of making at least two layers of cells in a wound situation where we can actually see what is happening

And we what we 're using is a silicon rubber membrane which is two  two point five centimetres  in diameter with a thickened ring

And this central portion here is covered with keratinocytes

Keratinocytes are the epidermal cells of the skin

As you can see it has a thickened rim and we put the cells in here to grow them 

The membrane sticks itself down to the dish

It 's self-adhesive

And we can place the cells in half a mil of medium so that they don't spread into the rest of the dish and they actually attach and grow

And then they are allowed to grow on being fed at intervals over the whole dish

When the  cells are well-grown on this area  we take an ordinary cork-borer and cut the centre out which forms the wound 

The  membrane is then quite easily removed by forceps from that petri dish into another one on which we 've laid a layer of collagen

Collagen is the sort of material that is found already found in the dermis of the skin

And so we now have a wound which is  e epidermis deep but not total wound thickness

And this collagen may or may not have fibroblasts in it

Fibroblasts are the part of the dermis that will grow and por form part of the wound 

This I 'm afraid will have to have the  light off for this

Uhm

Cor 

Great

Uhm this is what you will see on the silicon membrane when we 've got very active cells growing

These cells are actually in mitotic  division

This is the collagen view of the collagen

And this particular collagen has no fibroblasts in it and you can see that although these are very active cells they are not migrating on to the collagen 

This  is where we 've got active cells

We 've still got no cells in collagen but these are fibroblasts growing out of the silicon epidermal layer onto the collagen

So they 're going to populate the collagen from there 

Here you can see that as soon as the fibroblasts have grown out

and this was in within forty-eight hours

but as soon as the fibroblasts have grown out the ep epidermal keratinocytes start to grow over

And this is a very very useful indication of what is happening in a wound bed

We can use all sorts of activities on the fibroblast layer or in the keratinocyte layer before we put the two together and see what is happening 

The advantages of this model

the uses for this model to show cellular interaction to show cell growth in the presence of growth factors wound toxins clinical dressings antibiotics antiseptics desloughing agents which take off rubbish when there 's been a burn wound and replacing animals in certain areas of toxicity

Right now if you 'd come round here we have the Ottomans 

The  the Ottoman Turks captured Istanbul Constantinople in fourteen fifty-three 

And their first ruler was very interested in all things western  and he had actual western painters like Gentile Bellini to paint for him

So  ever after this time  you have a strong European influence and European naturalism  that pops in and out of Ottoman art  though Ottoman art of itself tends to be rather stylized 

The manuscript at the top is is reckoned to be about fifteen hundred  and it 's an Ottoman working of the story of the prince who set up the princess in the castle 

He 's here come to Constantinople to talk to the Byzantine emperor  so  as it is now under the Turks it 's drawn as though he were talking to the Sultan of the the Ottomans in Istanbul 

So the young prince is pointing right 

Above him is the Byzantine emperor  whose face has been somewhat rubbed but one sees a little bit of the under drawing with a big black moustache and a baggy turban 

And then there 's a bit of fancy cresting round the dome above the throne 

Then these uhm attendants and counsellors  are sitting on chairs

More people were beginning to sit on chairs in the Ottoman world 

Extending into the margin you have a black man and he 's a running footman 

I think at this point he 's taking a message between the emperor and the prince  but the normal function of these people is to run in front of a  rider to clear the way 

He 's got his gown kirtled up into the waist  and he 's carrying an axe to clear the way and he wears a special sort of hat 

Now in European

So  it 's pretending to be a portrait of him

I think it 's next to impossible that there 's any actual tradition of portraiture going right through the three hundred years  but  they make a very credible imaginary portrait

One  is willing to accept that as an individual 

And then it 's set into this very stylized frame  so that he 's also exhibited like a sort of specimen

So this is showing you this interesting balance in this classical Ottoman painting  between naturalism or pretend naturalism  and stylization 

The one down at the bottom here  is of fifteen eighty-two

It 's probably a rough working for another manuscript which is going to be grander 

And it 's telling us about a campaign in Georgia now of course the Soviet Union 

The Ottomans are here trying to mix this form of  

This is a style which equated with European naturalism

So  the first idea is not to be  glamorous and beautiful

it 's to get the story over  so you have mountain mountain mountain

We 're in mountainous country 

The  army on this occasion has been unwilling to follow their leader into a mountain forest  which is  rather an unusual event to illustrate

They 're using the gutter of the page for the river 

So  the gutter sort of emphasises the fall of the water

The commander of the army 's coming through all right 

His immediate bodyguards with high white plumes are following on  and behind him are coming two immediate attendants

They have a red drape down the back of their caps 

One of them would normally carry his sword and one would carry his  

The people in the cleft of the mountain who are hesitating about whether it 's a really good idea to do this  are the janissaries

They 're the foot soldiers who were the great strength of the Ottoman army  and they were derived from a levy of children from the Christian provinces of the Ottoman empire 

They took them with some care and they paid for them so it wasn't an entire  snatch job 

Some were drafted into the army if they were suitable for that and some went into palace service 

There are two Ottoman camps and in front of them there are standards with horse tails which is a symbol which the Turks had brought with them right the way from central Asia 

Next to that there 's a manuscript of about sixteen hundred uh which will have been made in Baghdad

There 's a small group of manuscripts of this character made in Baghdad 

And this has Ibrahim biblical Abraham

And he has just been lobbed into a fire by a wicked king called Numa  but because he 's a holy man the fire doesn't burn him 

It 's as though there were  a garden round him with  and roses 

So he 's in the fire 

The fire is burning but he 's also got his own personalised burning halo because he 's a holy man

And that 's shooting off to the right 

And then you 've got this uhm siege engine which has thrown him in and everyone is watching 

Now if you come round here we have the Indian room 

When you think of the Moslems in India the mind tends to jump straight away to the Moguls

They come in in fifteen twenty-six

But there 's a period before that which can approximately be called the Sultanate 

And there are a number of manuscripts which probably belong to this Sultanate  period or the Sultanate tradition and this is one of them 

Uhm it 's suggested here that it was made in Bengal in fifteen O eight and I think it was made on the western side of India in about fifteen forty

There 's There 's a lot of uhm  room for discussion in these things 

Anyway this is again a biblical subject

This is Yussef biblical Joseph  and his story is much more elaborate in the uhm  Islamic tradition

Here he 's just been acquired by the slavers and they are washing him  in a stream and they 're finding out what a very beautiful young man he is

Because in the  Islamic tradition the main well he 's very good and he is very beautiful 

He also has a burning halo 

Uhm one wouldn't automatically know from this picture that it was made in India

The thing which tells us that this manuscript was made in India is architecture which appears on other pages because the architecture is the thing which really binds it to a place 

Now the Moguls as I say come in in fifteen twenty-six 

And in the second half of the sixteenth century you have the rule of Akbar 

That 's running just about parallel with Queen Elizabeth the First 

And he has lots and lots of manuscripts made and this is a page from one of them 

It 's about fifteen eighty or just before 

Here you 're in prose because the writing is going straight across 

And this is a long and rambling romance  and here a young man has fortunately been able to draw a bow in the presence of a king a Hindu king 

If he hadn't he would have had his head cut off and strung up like the other unfortunate there 

So this is at a period where Akbar 's painting style the painting style practised for him is still forming and a lot of elements are going into it

There 's an influence from the  Sultanate school where you 've got these rather bright flowers and there 's a rather big flower above the text there 

The painter is a Hindu by name

He 's called  

You have a European influence again in the variegated sky 

And you have the local architecture which is red sandstone 

And you have the eaves which are very characteristic of Indian architecture  because you have the monsoon in India and the eaves are necessary to deflect it 

Then just about fifteen years later you have this one 

This was copied in Lahore in fifteen ninety-five

This is the five stories of  and this is one of the stories told by those princesses who were going to be set up in the palace as one saw in the other  picture 

This story appears to be the origin of the opera Turandot 

The princess is drawing a picture of herself and it 's going to be pinned on the palace door 

And then suitors will try for her hand and those who don't make it will be killed and the one who gets through will marry her 

So she 's up there

She 's wearing a transparent garment which is  uhm very typical Indian textiles

She 's got a drawing board on her knee which is  how they did it

It 's very difficult to credit  and the maid is holding up a mirror for her

Then there 's an elaborate carpet 

And I think in the middle of the carpet  you read that maroon patch as a tray in lacquer with her painting equipment on it 

Then the big lady beside her is the directress of the harem 

And on this side beside her there 's a eunuch 

Then below that there 's a lobby  which is so that when the harem doors are open men can't see directly in 

And then in the bottom corner you 've got this very nice little bit  where the men are talking to each other and it 's fairly obvious from their gestures that they 're saying you 'll never guess what batty thing the princess has done now 

The building is either in the red brick of Lahore  or possibly a bit in imported Indian red sandstone 

You have this high view which takes you right back to a nice little cool garden  which again has got a prominent flower rather like that one above the text there 

And above that you 've got a European sky with blue and white  merging together I think in a sort of wet technique 

The painter is again a Hindu

There 's just enough of his name to read it at the bottom 

There 's an interesting band round the walls

There are little inserts of tilework

And there 's an interesting frieze at the top of the wall  with people fighting  but I think it 's more a sporting contest than a  than a battle

And that I think is a sort of combination of an awareness of Indian temple sculpture  and a little bit of European classical drawing which has come in 

Because by this time there 's been about forty years of European influence European pictures floating in here and there

and they 're combining with this  Persian-based tradition  and whatever input from Hindu to make this style 

And again you 've got very fine writing and a gold margin like the bit of the manuscript on the other side 

Below  there 's a manuscript made in Agra when Akbar had gone back to Agra 

And this is about sixteen O three 

Here again you 're in prose because the writing 's going straight across 

And this is a history covering the time of Akbar 's father  who is at this point busy losing control of north India 

He 's losing it to another group of Moslems 

So  you have the Mogul army on the far bank  and you have the enemy on the near bank 

The enemy have brought forward I 'm sorry

The Moguls have built a bridge to get to the enemy

The enemy have brought forward their elephant  to trample down the bridge but one of the Moguls has managed to shoot the elephant 

So you have the elephant falling in this wonderful uh dramatic manner 

You have a very interesting contrast with people drowning in the very formalised Ottoman style and then the more naturalistic style here 

And you have this sort of seething mass of armour at the bottom 

The  dark tree in the upper left is from the Hindu tradition of painting where you put down a  dark slab  for a tree and you paint leaf leaf leaves on top of it 

Then  the distance is mainly derived from European manuscript painting

Again you need to look at it closely at some point but there 's a lovely effect of a glowing sky going golden towards the horizon 

There 's a little Moslem shrine and there 's a little Hindu shrine 

And then in the top right you 've got the Moslem camp and one can just see  one of the Mogul ladies above the tent wall 

In the bottom right the painter 's left a little space clear because that 's where it tells him what picture he 's  supposed to be doing  so that he 's going to be able to say

right

I 've done the right picture

and then he 'll get paid for it 

There seems to have been some sort of interruption  because evidently these would have been painted out in time 

And the painter 's name comes down below

And he 's again got a Hindu name which is  

And he is something of a specialist for dramatic pictures both  physical action and psychological action 

And he likes this strong diagonal which gives him the force of his drama

In the case of Torcello there is the historical reference in the early seventh century in six three nine uhm during the reign of the Emperor Heraklias one of whose coins from our collections you see on the right 

Uhm in the intervening time there 'd been further barbarian invasions  uhm those of the Lombards who arrived in the sort of five five eighties  uhm and their settlement plan is shown in the uh map here

These blue areas represent the areas of Lombardic settlement

So you can see that the pink marks which had made Byzantine include all this area round Venice

So i it remained a protected area but uh nonetheless there was th the the pressure of these Lombards coming down from the uhm hill land behind obviously accentuated this this move into the the lagoon 

Uhm so the the well there is were two bar waves of barbarian settlements that these communities are responding to 

Uhm the evidence that shows that the uhm community in Torcello was in place is an inscription in the wall of the basilica

And uhm it 's one unfortunately that I don't have a a slide of so if any of you do in your back pocket then do do do do come and speak to me afterwards

I should be very glad to hear from you 

Uhm but uh it 's uh visually not particularly interesting but historically uh rivetting in that it gives the date which you 've gathered uhm and the name of the emperor and the name of the exarch the chief uh official of the territory the exarchate uhm that still took its name from Ravenna uhm even though that city was by now  in considerable decline 

So here we are then uhm firmly in the six thirties

and Heraklias still on the throne although he was just about to uhm uh come to the end of his reign after his great uh wars in the East against the Persians and uhm about to uhm be overwhelmed by Arab conquest

So this is very much uhm a  uh uh a moment of some turmoil uh over in the Byzantine world proper uh

But it represents the uhm way that the last uh w well the last point when uh there could be this this uh close connection between Byzantium uhm uh and its territories that were still held in the West 

Right so I 've got the the historical context over

We know that this community was there and was therefore presumably building its church  uhm by the seventh century 

The buildings as we have them of course are later

Uhm they consist

Uhm I imagine you you you you 're all here as it were because you you you know this fact very well and you want to relive the memory in these in these cold climes of winter so I won't  uh spend too long telling you what you know

But uhm there are the the two uh principal standing buildings the uh long uh basilica church and then the church the round church of Saint Fosco 

And uh you might at first sight think that uh it was the round church that was the earlier because this is the plan that in Christian architecture normally betokens a fourth century date

One thinks of the church of Santa Constanza in Rome

Uhm but in fact th the thing is part and parcel of Torcello that uhm there is always this sort of a a a a a antiquating is that the 

archaizing that 's better uh phase uhm

And so in fact the the the church of Saint Fosco the round church on the right uhm probably is eleventh century uhm

But there may well not have been an earlier round church preceding it

That 's that 's really not at all clear 

Uhm the basilica is similarly uh eleventh century uh as we have it but uhm un undoubtedly uhm re uh uh uh rebuilt o or revamped from a seventh-century uhm original 

Uh and then of course in front of it in the area just opposite just somewhere down here is the uh are the excavated remains of the baptistry that we went with it in its first incarnation uhm so which also would have a sixth or seventh century uh date uhm

And that again is the is the characteristic feature of early Christian architecture to have a free-standing baptistry in that position 

So uh rather unusually then it seems that it 's the basilica uhm that predates the the round church 

There are the two interiors

the uh round interior uh very plain church of Saint Fosco on the left

and the long narrow interior of the basilica  on the right uhm with its two-aisled uhm  structure and the decoration of course uhm now largely confined to the uhm  a eastern apse

Uh the west wall which was behind us and then the uhm decorated uhm  transept  uhm the the south transept apse again

So the three elements to the surviving decoration 

I 'm not going to attempt to say anything at all about the iconostasis

I 'm not venturing into sort of Italian pre-Renaissance painting which as I take it is what we are looking at there from the fifteenth century uhm uh

I will say a word at the very end just about the the screen panels which are quite quite rivetting also in their way 

The inscription that I 'm  a representation of is on the north wall uh just there

Uhm the reliquary of Saint Heliodorus  down here 

OK 

Right

So I said that there was going to be a lot about Ravenna in this lecture

And uh let 's just start by establishing the idea of of the basilica plan uhm because of course many of the famous churches of Ravenna are built uh in this style 

Uhm and this one Saint Apollinaro in Classe similarly uh really retained the original decoration only in the in the the apse end 

So uhm it is a style then that is uh particularly characteristic of this uh area

Uhm or perhaps this just happens to have survived uh parti particularly well

Uhm there are very many uh basilica churches built all over Byzantium in the uhm first three centuries of Christianity

The fourth fifth and sixth

After uhm the conversion of Constantine it was the the principal church plan uhm

But uhm I suppose as later churches as churches were later renewed uhm they often adopted different uhm plans

And so uhm in uhm in the eastern Mediterranean there are perhaps fewer of the  of surviving basilica churches than uh these wonderful examples that we have in Italy 

The  the first element of the decoration that I want to describe uhm is that in the south transept 

And you see the the long view of it there on the left looking down to the   in the small apse there  the vault that you see a detail of here

and then we shall have a word to say about the standing saints down below 

And   the detail here of the uhm a sort of symbolic version of the Ascension really the Lamb uh that is Christ uh being raised up uhm by these four angels

A very uh handy scene of course to fit into a smallish uhm kind of vault that you can't get uh an overall uh round patterned subject into 

The  parallel here is really so striking that that uh there can be no doubt that it 's it 's deliberate

And it is with another of the Ravenna churches that of San Vitali 

Now this church of course was not actually a a basilica uh shape uhm but uhm the decoration that survived again in the apse end uhm is

We 're treating the apse uhm in much the same way as the uhm apse at the end of the uhm of the of the aisle of Torcello is being treated

So the difference in the shape of the church uhm doesn't really affect the the decoration very much

See if it 'll go a bit  bit sharper 

It 's not usually very successful when you try and alter these things from the front

Uhm  you see of course the detail here of the of of of the vault that 's over the main sanctuary area 

Uhm but uh it 's there 's such a close uhm similarity

Let me try and go back on the  right to convince you uhm that so there can be no doubt that the one was done in copy of the other 

The uhm question that that then immediately poses is uhm at what stage was this was this copy made 

Uhm now clearly we 're looking at in the uhm Torcello example at an eleventh-century mosaic given that that is the date of the church as we have it 

But uhm are we then suggesting that this was a copy uh made in the eleventh century of  a sixth century building uh with no uh intermediary 

Uhm

and I think it 's perhaps more likely to argue that the copy was made at an earlier stage uh maybe in the seventh century to go with the first basilica on the site and

and it was then reworked  uhm when the church was was rebuilt

So there was a sort of intermediate stage of the missing seventh century mosaic that that links the two that we have 

This whole question of course about how uhm mosaics were renewed in situ is something that bedevils the whole study of of the mosaics uh of Venice both at Torcello and at San Marco

And those of you who followed the uhm San Marco lectures that I did uhm last month will recall just how uhm how difficult it is when a mosaic is renewed uh gradually uhm over a long period and you have to uhm address the question of whether the design has changed  or remained the same uhm or whether within uh an identical design uh the the the the uh iconography was was changed uhm or whether you are just talking about individual tesserae being renewed in precisely the same sort of pattern and and and the same overall design

So there 's plenty of scope for alteration to be built in

And as we shall see this is something that afflicted Torcello particularly uhm in uh uh uh uh an example that we can actually reconstruct uhm fairly or uhm uh qui quite accurately and with some uhm interest to this whole problem

But for the moment  uhm I think that that uhm that 's not a problem

We have uhm fairly uh uh uh well surviving object

The only question is uhm whether as I say we we you need an intermediate copy to explain how the uhm how the transmission was made 

Uh where am I going

Uhm one on there two on there

 that 's right

The uh details getting uh closer here of the San Vitali example on the left  the Torcello on the right 

And obviously the similarity is not totally exact once the uh uh uh cross has actually been added in case you miss the point

the sacrificial nature of Christ and the cruciform halo

so it is getting more explicit as you would imagine 

The reason why  uhm this this question of when the copy was made is of some interest in that uhm I think this whole subject of symbolic representations of Christ has considerable importance in the lead up to the uhm period of iconoclasm  because you know that this was uhm a uhm a problem if that 's the word that assailed Byzantium in the early eighth century in the seven twenties uhm when they uhm convinced themselves that uhm we shouldn't have portraits of Christ and the Virgin and the saints shown in human form 

Now uhm the as we 've seen in the sixth century there in in Ravenna the it was fairly common to use symbolic representations

but that seems to have been the last moment at which it was common in which it was indeed allowed because by the time that we get into the mid seventh century

and uhm we 're looking here at a coin of Justinian the Second

so from the six eighties uhm we find quite a a major shift from symbolic representations to absolutely accurate physical representations

This is the first time that the image of Christ actually appears on the Byzantine coinage 

and there is actually an act of the council or the church councils uhm  council in six eighty that specifically says that you 're you 're not allowed to have symbolic representations of Christ because that is to deny  the nature of the Incarnation the fully human aspect of the Incarnation 

Uhm and clearly that 's of a piece with the move to put the face of Christ on the coinage 

So uhm this this movement against symbolic representations which is itself I think one of the uhm facts that brings about the reaction of iconoclasm is so very much sort of historically pinpointed to the uhm end of the sixth beginning of the seventh century that one feels that that really is the time when the the the it would have been replicated in Torcello uhm and so it could then just have gone on as it were being copied later on 

It 's quite hard to think of that climate of opinion being re-created in any way in the eleventh century 

Right so so much for that sort of theological excursion to uh discuss the vault mosaics

Uh down below the uhm four saints the standing saints in

still in that little uh transept uh uh uh aisle area we have the four uhm standing saints Ambrosius Augustine uhm Martin here on the right and Gregory the Great uhm and truly the the only other 

They 're fairly standard saints of the western church

The oddity perhaps is Martin who 's not really a Church Father on the same level uhm as the other three

Saint Jerome one might have thought would have been more appropriate and he was also of course from this part of the world and a friend a friend of Saint uhm Heliodorus 

So one wonders quite at his absence

Uh but again there 's I think quite a good parallel in Ravenna for the uhm enthus enthusiasm for Saint Martin and it 's from the church that we haven't yet mentioned

We talked about Saint Apollinaire in Classe

and we talked about San Vitali

and here we are at San Apollinaro Nuovo in Ravenna where uh uh the the characteristic decoration is these wonderful long processions of sort of the blessed of saints and virgins uhm down the the back of the the long sides of the basilica

and now behold the

uhm the the male procession is actually led by by Saint Martin 

And this seems to be have been an addition to the design put in in the sixth century perhaps to flatter the Franks who were the successors to the Lombards

so the next wave of invaders uh the Franks who were going to lead up to the conquest of the whole area by Charlemagne in the eighth century 

So this too

I think i i if you look back to Ravenna you can see perhaps a reason why this rather unlikely looking saint should have made his appearance uh in Torcello 

The centrepiece of the apse uhm decoration in the aisle is of course the  figure uhm the one on the left

Uhm the seated figure of Christ blessing with one hand holding the Word in the other  uhm and again uh an image that I think owes a very great deal to uhm a parallel from Ravenna

Again from Saint Apollinaro Nuovo this is the figure towards which that procession is leading Christ flanked by angels

Uh and that too seems to have been plucked uhm almost straight from the uhm from the sixth-century church even to the sort of uh squashy cushion uh on which on which Christ is sitting

Now members of the jury  you and I tried this case  as a  team 

There were thirteen judges  one of me  twelve of you  and uh we have different uh  parts to play 

During the trial  it 's been my task to  preside over the trial and decide any questions of law  which may have  arisen

And you remember once or twice you 've left the Court  which is quite usual  for that to be done 

Your duty was to listen to the evidence  read the  papers that were shown to you  a and uh  sit there  as patient judges  uh in the matter 

Now at this stage  again we have different parts to play 

I am the judge of the  law 

That duty is put on me 

I have to tell you what the law is  and you have to accept it from me 

I hope you 'll think it 's sensible law  but whether you do or not  uh you 'll have to accept it from me because I am the judge  of the law 

If I make a mistake  about it  and as a result  lead you into  doing an injustice to one side or the other  uh there  is a higher court that can  put it right and correct my error 

When it comes to the  facts and the decision in the case  you and you alone are the judges  you twelve together  of the facts  of the evidence 

And you try the case  on the evidence  that you 've heard  within the framework  uh of  uh the  law which I shall  state to you 

Now  what is evidence 

Evidence i is uh  that which uh witnesses  said in the witness box  when  called  examined and cross-examined 

and it 's also the documents  that you 've got in front of you  to uh  one or two of which I shall  refer in this summing up 

Of course  you are entitled to draw conclusions  from the  uh  evidence 

But uh  you mustn't uh imagine  evidence 

If there isn't any on a particular point  you mustn't invent it in your own minds or make guesses 

You approach it as we hope judges do  uh  fairly  and coolly and calmly  and weigh it up 

Uh the  defendants in this particular case  called no  evidence 

That doesn't mean that you automatically  uh have to accept  everything  said by the plaintiffs or their  witnesses  although uh  you may well do so  uh  i in most if not  all respects where it is  uncontradicted 

But whether you accept a witness 's evidence or not  and what he or she says is entirely a matter for you 

I mentioned imagining inventing or guessing 

Don't imagine invent or guess  as to what uh  the editor of the Tatler  one of the defendants or anyone else  who might or might not have uh  given evidence  or might or might not have said this that or the other in the witness box  if he or she had been called 

There 's no obligation on a party to call  uh evidence or any particular witness 

Uh  if evidence isn't called  then  you do without it 

You deal with the case on the evidence you have 

Now counsel 's speeches to you  Mr  uh Parks and Mr  Shield  and my summing up  are not evidence 

We can't give evidence 

Uh they 're meant to  assist you  counsel 's speeches and my summing up  when dealing  with the evidence  not to give evidence ourselves 

Now I shall summarize the evidence  I hope  pretty briefly because this has been a short case  as cases nowadays go  uh to remind you of it  the main points of it 

I shan't refer to it all 

If you uh  remember something  uh you think is important  which I don't  uh mention in my summing up  uh  you give such weight to it as you think right 

Maybe you think something in the evidence is important that I don't 

But it 's your view that counts 

Maybe I might miss something out because we are all human and I 've overlooked it  and you 've remembered it 

So act on it  if you think it right 

If you uh  think that in the  summing up or in the trial  I 've uh  expressed or h hold any opinions on the evidence  uh on the facts in the case  ignore them  unless you happen to agree with them 

Now when you retire  uh  later on this morning  to consider your  uh verdict  uh please choose  one of your number to be your  foreman or forewoman 

It 's entirely up to you who it is 

He or she  will give the answers to some simple questions which are in written form which I shall give you again in this summing up  on behalf of you all 

You may find it convenient if he or she acts as a sort of chairman of any  discussions you may have

But that 's up to you 

You may have heard members of the jury that in certain circumstances nowadays a court may accept from a jury  a majority verdict or  a ma a majority answer to a question put to the jury 

Uh that situation has not arisen here 

Uh

if it were to arise 

uh

and it would only do so if you  over a substantial period of time you 've been unable to agree on your  verdict 

I 'll give you further directions 

For the moment forget about majority verdict

Strive to reach  a verdict  answers to the questions  on which you are all agreed 

and you 'll be asked  or your foreman or forewoman will by the associates when you give the answers 

is that the verdict of you all 

Now  the law 

Members of jury the first point is this 

This of course as you know is a civil case

it 's not a criminal case

nobody 's going to go to the prison or be fined  or put on probation  uh after a conviction

It 's a civil case 

But just as in a criminal case in the courts of England and Wales the prosecution has to prove the case  so in a civil case the plaintiff has to prove his or her case 

Here we have two plaintiffs

So really there are two separate cases 

They are heard together  for convenience  and there 's a good deal of overlapping but you are dealing with two cases  uh one by Mr Winyard one by Mrs Winyard 

And both each of them has to  uh uh  prove his or her case  uh in any respect which is  uh  disputed challenged 

In a criminal case members of the jury if you 'd been sitting on a jury  down at the Old Bailey  uh you 'd 've been told that the prosecution has to prove guilt so that the jury is sure of guilt  to prove the case as is sometimes put beyond reasonable doubt

Now in a criminal case whilst in a I beg your pardon  in a civil case  whilst the plaintiff still has to prove his or her case  he or she carries a lesser burden  not such a heavy task

He or she has to satisfy the jury that he or she is right has proved the point that is being considered  case as a whole  on the balance of probabilities

In other words  tipping the scale  in favour of the plaintiff  uh as against the defendant 

That is the balance of probability 

You see

it 's not quite such a hea  not nearly in my opinion  and certainly not quite so much a heavy task as  proving a case beyond reasonable doubt 

Now in this particular case and all cases are different  the plaintiff first of all  and this applies to  uh each of the two  uh plaintiffs  has to prove that uh the words complained of were printed and published  uh in the Tatler magazine 

Well there 's no dispute about that

You 've got the copies and we shall be looking at them shortly 

Secondly the plaintiff has to prove that the words he or she complains of  refer to him  or her  talk writing about him or her 

Again that is not disputed here 

Thirdly the plaintiff has to  uh  show  uh  what the words mean 

He or she has to  set out in the statement of claim which you now know is the written document in which the plaintiff sets out his or her case  uh  put a meaning to the words

And you have to consider whether the plaintiff has  shown to you  that the words do mean what he or she uh suggests 

Fourthly  once you 've got to the meaning of the words  the plaintiff has to  satisfy you that the words were defamatory  libellous

I 'll help you about  what has to be  proved uh in a little while 

And finally 

fifthly and finally  if the plaintiff has succeeded on those four points  uh then uh  he or she will  get damages  uh  because uh there 's no  uh  defence like uh uh justification or truth I shall say a little bit more about that later put forward 

But when it comes to damages it 's again up to the plaintiff uh on the balance of probability on the tipping of scales  if there 's any matter that 's uh disputed to show you that he or she is right 

In so far as there 're any exceptions to  uh those directions I 'll mention it  uh in the course of the summing up 

Now uh  of course  uh you 've heard  uh these uh  uh words read out  al already  uh more than once 

But it 's right  because uh uh after all this is the  last time that you 'll hear  me or counsel  uh remind you of matters that we do just look together  if you wouldn't mind opening it for the last time as far as I am concerned  uh the September uh nineteen  uh uh eighty-nine  uh uh Tatler 

On your original  next to uh  what I think Mr Parks described as the model  in fact I think if you look inside the magazine it 's Miss Kylie Minogue  uh you you you you can see this on your  copy  needn't turn it up now  there is a  a a sticker  which uh  draws particular attention uh to  uh this  uh uh  article 

Uh

we haven't had any evidence as to whether it appeared on the issues  uh distributed in Scotland or how widely it was dis it was  uh  uhm  put  on the  uh  top copies of the Tatler 

but uh uh I 'll you needn't turn it up as I say 

I 'll uh just give you the reference 

it 's page ten  and the sticker was Scottish Borders Special

So uh  I 'll just draw your attention to it 

Now if you open it up  where you are very familiar  uh  page a hundred and uh  eight  I think it is in mine  that 's a spread showing the border country uh between  uh England  North of England and the South of Scotland  and various uh  houses  uh castles or whatever  with the names of the owners or residents  and uh uh uh little drawings 

and uh  uh  top left-hand  or top middle  top top left-hand corner there is a knight  on a steed 

Underneath it there is Stobo  Steven Winyard spelt S T E V E N

That 's the plaintiff  but actually his  correct name 's S T E P H E N

And then  there 's a recumbent figure  uh apparently  uh receiving massage 

And I think that it 's  common ground  that certainly  the mas  the the person giving the massage i is a girl 

and I think it was said  that it looks as though  the uh  uh person receiving the massage is also a girl

Uh if we were looking at  uh English uh figures there wouldn't be much doubt about it 

My only hesitation is  what looks like a skirt could presumably possibly be kilt 

But that may not matter very much 

Uh if you turn over you then get  pa the open spread  uh on the uh pages a hundred and uh  t ten  and a hundred and eleven  a hundred and twelve and a hundred and thirteen

And uh you 've got on page a hundred and eleven  bottom left-hand corner what is complained of 

Steven Winyard  Stobo Castle Stobo 

Steven Winyard used to be a croupier in Nassau but has since turned Stobo Castle into a health spa  where he gives personalised messages massages

His mother Gaynor Winyard is an  quote internationally renowned  beauty therapist unquote known more familiarly on the beautician circuit as quote the international boot  unquote 

Uh because of his unfortunate dress sense Winyard 's nickname for many years was quote man at C and A unquote 

That 's the whole  uh uh  uh  of uh the words complained of by both plaintiffs 

Perhaps you 'd leave it  open on that page for the moment  uh because I am going to say one other word about that

On twenty-first of  December in eighty-five  at Tunbridge Wells  the plaintiff  tripped over a drain in the road  and fell hitting her face on the ground 

She sustained a commuted and depressed fracture  of the left  malar bone 

She sued the local authority 

and on the sixteenth of September nineteen eighty-eight  she succeeded in establishing  the defendants were a hundred per cent liable 

Since her prognosis was then by no means clear  the issue of  quantum of damages was adjourned 

That has been the subject of the present hearing 

At the time of the accident she was thirty-nine years old  married  with children  and working full-time  as a nursing auxiliary  at the Pembury Hospital  near Tunbridge Wells 

It was work  which she much enjoyed  a and to which she was fully committed 

There 's no doubt that she was highly regarded  as an auxiliary nurse 

She had been so engaged since nineteen seventy-one 

She was then a stable  outgoing person  on the plump side if I may respectfully say so  fun-loving  sociable  independent  confident  happy-go-lucky  with a  good marriage  including  the sexual side  and in general she had very good health 

One gets a good idea of what she was like from the photographs  which have been introduced into in evidence 

And the one showing her in Austrian national  dress was taken I think about a year before the accident 

She then took size fourteen clothes 

On the day of the accident  and following it  she blew her nose and her left eye  came out of its socket 

It was induced back by ice packs

And fortunately the episode was short-lived  but it was very frightening 

Thereafter for the next five years she had a truly terrible time 

In the course of this case I remarked that she had taken a battering  a description  endorsed by one of the doctors  who gave evidence 

I shall now run through  a chronology  of the major events  assisted by  uh Mr Shaw 's  helpful document 

As I 've said the on the twenty-first of December eighty-five the date of the accident  she was admitted to the  Kent and Sussex Hospital overnight for observation 

On the twenty-third of December eighty-five she went to the Kent and Sussex Hospital  and uh  the injury which I 've mentioned was diagnosed 

She was then referred to the  Queen Victoria Hospital East Grimstead  which specialises in  matters of this sort 

So on twenty-seventh of December  there under a general ana anaesthetic  there was a reduction and fixation  of the fracture of the left malar bone  with wires 

And an antral pack  was inserted  that was to  raise I think the uhm  depression  and to keep the uh  reduced bones in place 

From January eighty-six  she suffered heavy menstrual bleeding 

Though this was probably not attributable to the accident 

The uh fitting of this uhm antral pack was a  a painful business 

The pack became infected 

And on the  fifth of February  she had a second operation  when the pack was removed  under general anaesthetic 

She was discharged home on the sixth of February 

On the seventh of March eighty-six she had a chronic discharge from her nose 

On the ninth of June  she resumed  her pre-accident work  but working two nights  a week instead of three or four which she had done previously 

By October eighty-six  the plaintiff 's general practitioner  Dr Reeves  noticed an increased sinking of the depression  on her left cheek 

She had noticed in February  that an old  surgical scar  was apparently swelling and this turned out to be  an incisional hernia  in other words the uh  gut was trying to come through  the old operation scar 

On the second of October  eighty-six  she was readmitted to the Pembury hospital  or rather admitted to the Pembury hospital  for repair of the  hernia 

That took place on the next day  and she was discharged home  on the fifth of October 

The hernia was due  to uh  vomiting  as a result of the treatment that she was given for her injury  and straining while defecating  because she had become constipated again due to this  due to the uh treatment 

On the sixth of October 

She 'd obviously ceased to work  uh this time  a a and became  uh and ceased work because of the necessity to attend to this hernia 

Thereafter she suffered from thrombosed  haemorrhoids  again I 've no doubt due to the uhm  accident 

And she had to try to build herself up  for the next operation 

She was readmitted  on the fifteenth of January to the Queen Victoria Hospital East Grimstead  and had a fourth operation on the sixteenth of January  and then  what 's called a  proplast implint impl a proplast implant was introduced 

This is a prosthesis  an artificial object 

She had a lot of swelling and pain  following the operation 

And on the twenty-seventh of March  eighty-seven  she was readmitted to the Queen Victoria Hospital  and the implant was removed  under general anaesthetic because it had become infected 

By April eighty-seven  Dr Reeves noticed that the floor of the eye socket was sinking 

Nevertheless on the eighteenth of May she resumed work  as a nursing auxiliary  in the out-patients department of Pembury Hospital

That means working d working days 

On the sixth of June  her general practitioner noticed an increased collapse of the left maxilla 

On the seventeenth of August eighty-seven she ceased work on medical advice 

I 'll come back to that later when I deal with the question of loss of wages 

On the seventh of March eighty-eight her employment was formally terminated 

On the sixteenth of May eighty-nine she was readmitted to Queen Victoria Hospital where her sixth operation  took place the following day 

And then a  lyophilised cartilage implant  was placed 

That 's uhm  some sort of animal cartilage 

She was discharged home on the eighteenth of May 

Subsequently  it became infected  and the infection burst through the cheek  and discharged through the cheek 

On the eighth of June eighty-nine she was readmitted to Queen Victoria Hospital for her seventh operation  which took place the following day  for the removal of this cartilage implant 

The antrum was explored  multiple polyps were removed  and a lateral antrostomy was performed 

She was discharged home the eleventh of June 

And on the fourth of July eighty-nine  she was readmitted to Queen Victoria Hospital  for her eighth operation 

Took place the following day 

And there the infra-orbital wound was debrided  small pieces of cartilage were removed 

Discharged home  two days  later 

By then she was having  difficulty with her teeth 

A plate had been advised  but which she hasn't subsequently worn  t

two teeth had been extracted  from the upper left side  at the rear 

Her general practitioner said that her significant injury  was deteriorating 

By this time she had had several operations  on her face  and was becoming pretty desperate 

And nobody blames her 

And uh  she decided to  try another avenue 

And uh after research by her solicitors  she consulted a Mr Patrick James  who apparently is a  world authority  on this type of surgery 

And he advised  that instead of uh  these alien bodies being introduced into her face  that she should have an autogenous  bone graft taking bone from the iliac crest of her hip  and inserting it into the left cheek bone

The bones hadn't knitted properly and were unstable 

And this operation was performed on the twenty-seventh of March  nineteen ninety this year

And she was an in-patient until the  third of  April 

I shall return  to that later when I deal with the question of uhm future loss  and and her general prognosis 

Now what effect did all this have upon the plaintiff 

Dr Reeves described her as a very brave courageous woman  who coped very well 

Oh yes she suffered greatly and still suffers 

She has had no feeling  on her left cheek 

The left side of the nose  the left upper lip  the left upper gum  and two  of the front teeth on the left side are numb 

And that will be permanent 

That 's due to the injury  to the  nerve which provides sensation 

This part of the face is also paralysed  and can produce no facial expression 

That 's due to damage of the motor nerve 

And when she smiles her face is a bit lopsided 

It 's not gross 

But it 's there to be seen 

Now this may improve  depending of course upon whether the nerve improves 

But there is the possibility  of some improvement 

The left side of her face is hypersensitive  and reacts to weather conditions 

As a result  she 's had difficulty in  chewing  and drinking 

She tends to dribble from the corner of her mouth  and this causes soreness  and embarrassment 

She can't tell whether her left nostril is running  and this is also embarrassing for her 

She has a dragging sensation on the left side of her face  and feels as though the cheek is full of food 

There 's a certain amount of scarring 

But it is not gross  and can  to a great extent be camouflaged 

She has difficulty in keeping her teeth clean

She can't feel 

She 's had twitching of the left eye two or three times a day  though it is getting better 

She 's had headaches two or three times a week  for a couple of hours at a time  but she 's getting better 

She 'd had anaemia 

And there 's a scar on her hip  as a result  of the  bone graft  which gets a bit sore at times 

She has suffered  pain and discomfort as a result  of these numerous operations 

And also perhaps more importantly  she 's been boosted up  with the thought that the next operation may be successful and be the last  and then repeatedly let down  because of the repeated failures  of these operations 

She has had financial worries owing to not being able to work  or rather I should say at this stage  owing to not working 

As a result of her condition her husband became ill and depressed  and once with symptoms of a heart attack  which of course reflected back upon her 

She suffered a reactive depression 

That is a definite psychiatric illness  brought on by a situation  not serious enough to warrant a referral to a psychiatrist  but treated by her general practitioner Dr Reeves  who in my judgement is a competent and caring general practitioner  with good insight  into the psychological health  of his parents  of his patients

I beg your pardon 

She uh suffered weight loss 

She now wears  size ten in clothes  whereas formerly she wore size fourteen 

She has suffered from broken sleep and still does  and from tiredness  and anxiety 

Anxiety of course  about the prognosis for her face 

some anxiety attributable to this  litigation 

She suffered a gross loss of confidence 

She has a fear of receiving a blow to her face 

And she has a fear of  having a further fall 

She has a feeling of incompleteness  and that she is damaged and imperfect 

And this has had an adverse effect upon her sex life 

There has also been a loss of social life  for she has been too embarrassed to eat out 

To hide her facial deflects defects  she  applies a special  camouflage make-up which has been prescribed for her 

Apparently it takes about an hour  altogether  to put it on and take it off again 

It is obviously very time-consuming 

She has been treated with sleeping tablets  and from time to time  with anti-depressants 

Following her last operation  she hoped  and I think with some justification  that the injury to her face can be resolved  in an acceptable way  both structurally  and cosmetically 

Her depression  and its symptoms  are at the moment getting better 

And her state of mind will depend upon what happens in the future 

She is well motivated 

And I think she will improve emotionally once this case is over  and provided the last operation is successful 

She told me that she wants to be free of lawyers and doctors  and and to be independent to run her own life again 

And I think if she can achieve that  to an acceptable degree  then her depression will completely disappear 

As I 've said it is reactive and depends upon  how she perceives her situation 

Well what is her prognosis 

If her body does not reject the bone graft which  Mr James has done  and does not become infected  it is probable she will need a further operation  during the period September to December of this year 

At the moment the graft is too bulky  and the bone is rather prominent below the left eye  and will probably need trimming

This ruling will be taped and the transcript can be obtained by if desired by any party 

Uh as I 've had occasion to say before uh  although uh much progress has been made uh in uhm  ensuring that uh defamation cases are tried uh within a reasonable time uh there have been two cases which have caused problems

This is one of them 

Uh  I am not uh saying that this is  a a a case which uh could be processed to trial with the same  rapidity as a straightforward  uh alleged libel in a  newspaper where everything arose in and around London

Of course not

However there have been delays

And uh o one particular aspect  o of the delays uh i is uh uh of considerable relevance uh on this occasion 

The c the case has been uh before uh uh me or another judge of this division on more than one previous occasion 

It 's also been to the Court of Appeal on one occasion although that 's not  uh relevant to today 's uh summons 

On the tenth of May this court gave a number  uh gave several rulings on what Miss Rogers for the defence described as the housekeeping occasion 

Uh  previously the court had made an order for security of the costs 

On the uh tenth of May  uh this Court adjourned  uh for further consideration which is taking place today an application by the uh defendant uh in regard to uh Civil Evidence uh Act uh e evidence 

The Court thought that the proper notices ought to be served  which they had not been

uh

And that was done  uh not long after the date of hearing

The Court also tho thought a and ruled uh that uhm  there should be affidavit evidence uh to explain  uh why uh the application had not been made at an earlier date  uh bearing in mind the provisions uh of the uh Act uh and the Rule 

Uh in the circumstances which have been uh explored at length today it 's not necessary uh for uh me to dwell at length upon  the Civil Evidence Act uh or uh the uh Rules i in regard to  uh what evidence may be uh  adduced uh

the formalities have been observed or the  court in the exercise of its discretion wholly or partly  uh excuses the failure to follow the formalities  because uh in the end there is  very little uh uh argument raised on behalf of the plaintiff uh against the submissions made by Miss Rogers on the first aspect uh of the summons 

Uh the act to which I 've referred is of course the Civil Evidence Act uh Nineteen Sixty-Eight 

And Miss Rogers ' uh  point uh is that uh all the uh evidence uh uh which is sought to be adduced uh is uh evidence which was given in a uh coroner 's court uh in Gibraltar 

That is admissible she submits  uh either  uh under  uh Section Two of the Act and or under Section uh Four 

Uh

she uh refers to uh  uh one au authority  in this regard namely the case of  uh Taylor and Taylor  uh reported in uh  nineteen seventy  Two All England Six O Nine  uh which uh  is not all that far from the uh present uh case and certainly supports her proposition 

The Court has to decide whether  uh  this is an appropriate  receiving Court u under the  uh  Act and whether the Coroner in Gibraltar is an ap uh an appropriate giving Court  so far as the evidence is concerned 

Uh Miss uh Rogers explained this at considerable length

And I could take up time in this ruling uh by uh giving reasons why uh in my judgement she made good her submissions under both Acts 

I don't propose to do so uh because really the only point  uh made by Mr Shields on this part of the case uh on this part of the summons  i is to say uh that uh the Act  and the Rules made thereunder ought to be held not to apply  uh to uh a a uh court uh  in another jurisdiction  specifically the Gibraltar uh Coroner 's uh Court 

I uh uh  do not consider uh that  uh submission is uh well founded

Uh there is nothing uh so it seems to me uh in the Act or in the Rules uh which uh would uh justify the taking of that uh view 

Now uh  as I say I don't propose to go into any further details on that uh aspect o of uh the matter 

Mr Shields '  uh  objection is  of really that which uh requires some consideration although I 'll try to do it as briefly as I can in justice to his submissions  uh

relates to uh the exercise o of the Court 's discretion 

Or he would say

I think 

in one aspect of the matter uh the Court really in effect has no discretion and should uh refuse uh this uh summons 

Order Thirty-Eight Rule Twenty-One  uh provides uh that uh  the uh  statements which he has sought to uh put in under the Civil Evidence Act Nineteen Sixty-Eight  uh should be served within twenty-one days after the setting down of the case 

Uh this case was uh in fact set down  very much uh  longer ago than twenty uh  one days uh before uh this uh  application was initiated

It was in fact set down on the twenty-fourth of July nineteen eighty-nine 

Order Thirty-Eight Rule Twenty-Nine  does however  uh allow the Court  uh a uh discretion uh in the uh matter 

There is some uh  uh law  uh on this matter  a and I have been uh referred  uh to it 

There is the case of uh Ford uh and uh Lewis Nineteen Seventy-One One Weekly Law Reports  uh Six Two O Three  uh and uh  the case of Morris  and Stratford upon Avon  uh Rural District uh Council  uh Nineteen Seventy-Three One Weekly Law Reports uh One O Five uh Nine 

I 've also been referred  uh to an observation by Mr Justice Harmann  uh in uh the case  of Rover International and Canon Films Sales Limited Nineteen Eighty-Seven One Weekly Law Reports  uh One Five Nine Seven  a at page uh  uh sixteen hundred 

The uh principle the overriding principle  uh  s seemed to me  uh to be two 

Uh

first of all  uh  the late uh  uh service  o of the notices

and the initiation of this application  uh must not be for  any uh tactical  uh manoeuvre  as for example sitting on the statements uh until uh  i it is seen  whether it is to the party  uh which has the advantage  to use them 

The admission however  uh to comply with the Rules  uh may uh Mistes uh uh Mr Shields submits and I have sympathy with this submission  uh not be a deliberate  uh  tactical move 

but may be wilful or otherwise culpable 

He extracts those words from  Paragraph Seventeen Fourteen in Fibson on Evidence 

and I think it 's helpful just to read part of that paragraph  if only to say this













And now uh uh here  uh  the uh uh defendants  uh certainly uh if I may descend to the homely put their running shoes on uh uh at any stage uh in the uh proceeding 

A plea uh uh a uh a an amended defence containing a plea of justification  uh is in lieu of the  uh previous plea of fair comment  uh was uh  uh completed  uh in I think September of uh nineteen eighty-nine 

And as Mr Shields said a party should uh  uh have its uh tackle in order  uh at any rate by the time such a plea of justification is put upon the record 

And says Mr Shields 

it 's a fact here  that on this particular limb of the justification because there 's another limb with which the Court is not concerned today  unless the defendants can get this evidence  or substantial part of it before the Court  uh then that justification has no hope of running at all 

Uh

now uh  when this matter came before the Court uh on the uh tenth of May  Mr Shields pointed out  uh with uh uh acerbity  but with justification  that really the Court had been given no reason at that time  uh as to uh why uh the uh uh  application had not been made earlier and why the notices uh had not been served

And I indicated that at not only they should be served as I 've put said already but that an affidavit should be  uh filed 

An affidavit has been made uh sworn by by Mr Brett the solicitor  for the defendants 

And uh  he has explained at some length  uh  the history of the matter 

Uh

there 's no doubt so it seems to me uh that for a considerable time  he may well have hoped uh that uh some at least  of these uh witnesses from Gibraltar who gave evidence at the inquest  uh might 've been  in the case of those whose identity is not known  identified and might have been uh uh  brought able to be brought here to give oral evidence 

He wrote letters

He went to Gibraltar 

And it wasn't till the end of the year uh that it was quite clear I don't think that this is disputed  that he wasn't going to  uh get them  here and in the cases of the army and security people wasn't going to get their  names 

Uh then there 's the question of the transcript 

Uh  he was uh offered the transcript uh at a very expensive price 

And uh he had to negotiate and eventually got the transcript at a sensible price

That led to some uh delay 

When that was obtained the transcript was sent

And it fills three lever arch files fat ones at that to leading counsels for the defendants on the twenty-fourth of January 

Finally on the twelfth of April uh

not finally then on the twelfth of April a as a result of instructions which had been given to her  and to her leader Miss Rogers uh provided a short advice uh giving a uh list  a provisional list of witnesses uh that she thought having discussed the matter with Leading quest uh Leading Counsel needed uh statements uh to be  uh  served 

When the matter was before me  uh in uh  uh May  I said this in the transcript 

I asked when the transcript which had been obtained was in fact placed before Leading Counsel 

I admit that I expected to be told oh last Friday evening or something of that sort 

In fact I was very candidly told and I repeat my acknowledgement of the candour that it was placed before him in January last 

That seems to me to be a very considerable uh time ago 

I 've said I need not mention the name of the Leading Counsel

And I spoke about his  uhm  qualities and work and so on 

Uh

I then added

I do find it rather difficult to comprehend if all turns on his assessing 

and I quite understand why the defendants want his view about this which witnesses are likely to be required that he has taken since January to do it 

Now Mr Shields points out and I must say it accords with my recollection  uh prompted by the transcript uh that I was told that the delay since January had been due to the fact that nobody could  move until Leading Counsel had read the transcript  and uh  had advised on this matter 

Uh  it now appears that that is not what the position in fact was 

Mr Gows-Williams had not been asked to read the transcript although it had been delivered to him 

In fact rather the contrary

Miss Rogers without objection from Mr Shields has read to me letters today  which accord with what I should have thought was likely to be the  uh have been the position

In fact I said so in the course of argument before the letters were read 

You advise us Miss Rogers that if you are in doubt about any particular uh witness or matter have a word with your leader  which really is a rather different uh uh uh position from that which uh uh I had thought in May

This is ruling number three 

Uh Mr Brown on behalf of the plaintiff applies to uh amend uh the pleadings in the  the two uhm statements of claim in various respects 

Uh save for one the applications are non-controversial

I accept it on behalf of the defence by Mr Grey

They will be allowed without any further service 

The one controversial amendment  and I needn't I think read the proposed amendment in either uh statement of claim arises in these circumstances

Uh  they uh  at a at an interlocutory stage in this uh matter I heard a a hotly uh contested uh application to strike out  uh a uh uh part of the statement of claim which relied upon in effect the republication of the  uh  the libel said to be contained in the television film in reviews which appeared in the press I think both after a preview uh of the uh film to critics and  uh a after the uh public uh te uh telecast itself 

I came to the conclusion  uh that uh the  that part of the pleading should not be struck out 

The matter very properly was taken to the Court of Appeal for reconsideration and the Court of Appeal agreed with my  uh ruling

In the course of my judgement there are two passages uh which to which reference should be uh made 

The first is at page one uh of the judgement

When I said they did not do that it seems to me an obvious inference and that of course was the preview in order to give those ladies and gentlemen somewhere warm to sit out of the winter cold

they did it to provide and this is well known to be customary certainly with important productions a preview  so that the mystery about the film could and would appear in the press and in other media programmes either before on the day of or after the transmission of the programme

And then at number at page seven I said I 'm impressed by the facts which I recited at the beginning of this ruling namely the quite deliberate showing of this programme to the media and the inference which I 've drawn that the intention  was  that the media should reproduce the punch of the programme

So I drew the inference that the intention was that the media should reproduce the programme 

The Court of Appeal  uh did not uh dissent from those observations indeed  came to the conclusion and I needn't with respect refer to their judgements  that it was appropriate to dismiss the striking out application 

Now what Mr Grey seeks to do is to amend the statement of cl statements of claim to make it quite clear that intention that the sting of the libel should be reproduced  uh uh is alleged  uh before me and before the Court of Appeal the argument really surrounded uh uh uh uh

I 'm sorry the argument really was based principally upon  natural and probable consequences of the  uh preview  and the the the  later broadcast although the preview is the important  uh uh occasion 

That 's true 

Uh I  do not think there is adequate material upon which I could possibly say that uh the intention was disavowed

Uh it 's not suggested uh in either my judgement or those of the Court of Appeal  a

and uh there 's no suggestion that Mr Brown has as it were sat on uh this amendment uh as a deliberate tactical move

I say that because Mr Grey has suggested to the Court this morning that if intention had been originally pleaded uh then he would not have been able uh to pursue his striking out application even before this Court let alone the Court of Appeal

In those circumstances said Mr Grey uh it uh would be unfair uh to  and unjust to allow the plaintiff to amend his statement of claim now

In the absence a a and thi thi this is not the contrary is not suggested of any uh deliberate tactical ploy

if this is simply a case a as Mr Brown puts it of realising that the particular hole has been stopped up  to avoid any further argument

Uh i i it seems to me that uh uh  intention uh  the inference of intention uh  can be as readily drawn a a as not

Whether it should be drawn is a matter for the jury 

Uh I think Mr Brown is right that it should be spelled out in the statement of claim 

And that is what he now seeks to do 

And uh uh  I believe that uh in the circumstances including the obvious uh  obvious uh  point that in the second passage I have read from my judgement uh I was uh uh making the inference myself uh uhm that the intention was that the punch of the programme should be reproduced

in those circumstances uh I do not believe that injustice is uh caused or anything dramatically new is introduced by the proposed amendment

Uh Mr Grey says that it uh  calls for some further particulars

Well this case is of  of sufficient length that uh  uh it will be before this matter has to be argued before the jury or before this before me at a later stage plenty of time for a request if so advised for further and better particulars to be uh made

A and I am sure that will be given consideration

If there 's any dispute about it I will make an appropriate ruling

But I think that it is not  uh unjust uh and indeed uh justice requires  uh uh the uh uh uh allowing of this uh amendment

Whether the ju what conclusion the jury on the facts comes to of course in due course  i is will be entirely a matter for them

However it may well be an amendment without reservice

My Lord first of all uhm can I just make clear we I do intend to show the jury the first version of the film because it 's relevant to the way we put our case both on malice and exemplary damages

But right from the start right from the uh writing of the script a and the subsequent filming of that script there was an intention to deride and belittle Mr sh Slipper and to show him as an imbecile 

Uh what he uh now says is that although no application has been made to strike out this paragraph either hitherto or today no evidence should be allowed by your lordship which in any way refers to the 

And your lordship has seen the way in which it is pleaded at page seven of the  statement of claim

and what we say there is that the defendants were well aware that their defamatory implications against the plaintiff could not be justified

and we rely on the settlement by the B B C 's wholly owned subsidiary

Which the solicitors for the B B C themselves were fully aware that if they 'd dealt with this settlement  that uh in return for the payment of a large sum by way of damages and costs and an agreement probably uh Mr Slipper would withdraw his action uh both in relation to the second action in relation to The Listener and to the Edinburgh Festival showing of the film

Now My Lord can I make uhm certain things absolutely clear

Mr Grey repeatedly says it 's not helpful for me uh to keep on harking to matters which are part of the exemplary damages claim

I 've no doubt that he wishes very much there wasn't an exemplary damages claim 

Your Lordship is right

If it wasn't there this case would be a great deal shorter

But it is there

No attempt has been made to strike out any part of it and I 'm entitled to put these matters before the jury 

Can I explain precisely what the argument is on the uh so-called Listener action

It 's very simple

For a start it 's not a different libel to use Mr Grey 's phrase 

My Lord it is a total red herring  that the uh programme which was being previewed in The Listener was in fact in a different form to that which was ultimately broadcast

It is of course a matter for the jury to what extent they regard the revisions as fundamentally effecting a difference

But that is by the way

The point is that there is a precise correlation between what the plaintiff says are the meanings of the broadcast as  at paragraph five on page four and the allegations for which the B B C apologised in The Listener

Can I make that good by referring to the document My Lord uhm  

And uh it 's page three 

My Lord first of all uh page three right-hand column it 's alleged that Scotland Yard that 's to say Slipper had bungled the capture of Mr Biggs 

Then uh over the page top of the second column it 's alleged that he was bumptious that he had a a head full of headlines when he sped off to Rio

Bumptious and head full of headlines plainly suggests vanity

And also it is alleged that uh he was ignorant of the crucial lack of an extradition treaty 

So one has got bungling or incompetence  vanity  bumptiousness head full of headlines  ignorance of the crucial lack uh of an extradition treaty 

My Lord those meanings correlate very nicely in my submission with the meaning pleaded in the statement of claim  at page four  or s

or some of them at any rate

We see there in five one uh vanity  five two an incompetent police officer

Mr Grey said yesterday well th there 's no difference between incompetence an an and bungling

Uh

and finally uh three  uhm no My Lord I 'm so sorry two c I ought to refer to  so unprofessional a manner as to make the British Consul think he did not know his business and was ignorant of the absence of an extradition treaty between England and Brazil

and three uh wholly or partly to blame for the fiasco whereby Biggs was not brought back to England 

And my the basis on which uh Mr Grey said that uh the B B C 'd gone out of their way to make it plain that uh Mr Slipper uh portrayed himself as as aware  uh  of the non-existence of an extradition treaty

My Lord in in fact there is a scene in the film your lordship should notice  in which just before  the uh  the police go to detain Biggs the British Consul said to Mr Slipper

I hesitate to mention this

and I assume that you gentlemen referring to Slipper and his subordinate know your own business

but you do realise we 've no extradition treaty with Brazil

Well why on earth did he say  

Why on and and he then goes on to say yes

But why on earth should  why on earth should Mr Neil make that comment unless Mr  uh Slipper had given the appearance to him uh of uh ignorance of the extradition treaty

Now My Lord if we look at the apology at page d seven  the B B C accept in the last sentence there is no truth in a number of allegations and apologises for them 

The inaccuracies for which they apologise are the suggestion of ignorance of the extradition treaty the suggestion of ignorance of which branch of the Brazilian police with whom to collaborate a matter which was raised uh in the particulars of justification and uh the suggestion that he bungled the arrest of Biggs

So My Lord I say that this settlement is of the greatest importance to our claim that the B B C knew the defamatory imputations pleaded in the statement of claim could not be justified

And what the original programme said for these purposes is neither here nor there

It 's the fact that there is precise correlation between the pleaded defamatory meaning and the meaning for which the B B C apologised in The Listener

Now My Lord  can I uhm just say uh one other thing

There is uhm here uh a point of of of perhaps of some importance

It 's not just the apologies and the retraction

There is also the question of the undertaking an undertaking not to repeat the same or a similar libel

By what is uh called an interim final arbitration award dated the twentieth of December nineteen ninety uh the owners were awarded a net sum of one hundred and seventy-one thousand four hundred and seventy point two six dollars in respect of seven instalments of time charter hire

That was a net sum uh because a deduction of ninety-nine thousand odd dollars was made in respect of the first instalment of hire which had been paid inclusive of charges for bunkers and the like and secondly because the time charters were acknowle charterers were acknowledged to have raised arguable set-off defences totalling a hundred and forty-two thousand dollars odd 

The amount of each instalment  that is to say the second and subsequent instalments of hire which were payable half-monthly was of the order of fifty-nine thousand dollars 

One defence raised by the charterers uh which failed before the arbitrators uh was based upon Clause Seventy-Three of the time charterparty

Uh the charterers sought leave to appeal against that decision by su uh summons a motion issued on the tenth of January nineteen ninety-one uh

But they were refused leave to appeal by Mr Justice Hobhouse on the twentieth of February nineteen ninety-one 

They now come  uh before the Court on an originating motion also issued on the tenth of January uh which seeks first a declaration uh that the award was made without jurisdiction on the part of the arbitrators uh in so far as it purported to award any instalments of hire after these first two that were claimed

Since the first instalment had been paid uh the relevant two instalments of hire were the second and third that became due under the charterparty

Alternatively the originating motion claims remission of the award on the grounds that the arbitrators first acted without jurisdiction in respect of what I will call the later instalments of hire

and secondly uh the arbitrators did not give the charterers a proper opportunity to present their case as regards the scope of the arbitrators ' jurisdiction or as regards their the charterers ' liability for these further instalments 

The time charterparty was for the period of a voyage from the U K continent to the Red Sea Indian ports the charter being dated the sixth of September nineteen ninety

The arbitration clause Clause Seventeen uh required the appointment of three arbitrators as in fact was done

The hire provision in Clause Five provides for the payment of the hire in every fifteen days in advance what were in other words effectively half-monthly instalments

Delivery took place on the seventeenth of September

It followed that the dates for the payment of hire instalments according to the charterparty uh were on October the first and sixteenth on October the thirty-first and November the fifteenth and on November the thirtieth and December the fifteenth 

The voyage was uh eventful 

First uh because when the vessel was at Antwerp she was arrested by the charterers who were alleging that she was unseaworthy

The vessel remained under arrest from September the twenty-sixth until October the nineteenth and there was uh consequently a dispute about the liability for hire in respect of that period

I can say here i in parentheses uh that on one view of the matter that period of arrest and allegedly when the vessel allegedly was on hire affected the dates when the hire instalments became due

That contention explains why when arbitration was subsequently demanded it was by reference to instalments paid payable not only not on the dates which I 've indicated but on other later dates

Uh th

that uh issue has not arisen for decision in these proceedings

and it is sufficient that it is noted merely as an explanation of why demands were made with reference to other dates than those I have already uh noted

The vessel arrived at Madras the first discharging port on November the twentieth

The charterers uh were unable to produce the original bills of lading

and the owners therefore sought the indemnity which they were entitled in lieu of bills of lading under Clause Seventy-Three

The dispute which arose out of Clause Seventy-Three concerned the question whether the  relevant indemnity should be signed or countersigned by a bank rather than by the charterers uh themselves without any countersignature 

Discharge was completed subsequently uh on

the precise date is one which I do not have

The v v vessel then proceeded to the second discharging port which was Calcutta where her E T A was D December the fourteenth p m

She was allegedly then delayed for a period of three days off Calcutta that is to say from about the fifteenth until about the eighteenth of December the charterers alleging that uhm during that period she was on hire or alternatively uh the shipowners are liable to them in damages in the like amount as hire

She completed discharge in Calcutta and was subsequently redelivered to her owners on the eighth of January nineteen ninety-one 

The story of the voyage which I 've given in outline provides the background to the arbitration proceedings uh which began in November nineteen ninety

Uh a that was after what might be called a false start

Uh another matter entirely separate from present uh issues ha had arisen but then evaporated at the dispute in October

Now the nature of the charterparty is important for this reason 

When the owner of a time chartered vessel is entitled to periodic payments of hire it is important for him that he should receive prompt payment of each instalment in order to preserve his cash flow 

He is entitled to such payments subject only to the limited category of cross-claims which the law permits to be raised as defences by way of set-off in such circumstances

The owner of course does have the or usually has the right to withdraw uh the vessel for nonpayment of hire

But that is not likely to be an effective or a sufficient sanction when the market rate is no not higher than the charter rate or alternatively when there is cargo on board uh which uhm inhibits the owners uh from withdrawing the vessel with immediate effect 

It is common therefore for owners to seek prompt uh uh arbitration award in respect of instalments of hire the procedure for which London Arbitration is provides in such circumstances

A and the reasons for it uh were considered in uh detail and authoritatively considered uh by Mr Justice Robert Gough as he then was in the Costas Milos nineteen eighty-one One Lloyds Reports page eighteen 

It is accepted in the present case uh that there is a separate cause of action in respect of each instalment of hire

and I shall also assume for present purposes uh that arbitrators can also award uh the payment of any instalment of hire unless they have been appointed so that they have authority to make such an award in respect of each disputed instalment of hire 

The only uh gloss which I would uh respectfully add to what was said in the judgement of the Costas Milos is this

The phrase interim award there used is interim in the sense that the final resolution of the charterer 's liability is deferred to a final award that is to say a final award in respect of the same instalment or instalments of hire 

One reason why uh such a final resolution uh may be deferred to a final award is the fact that it is sufficient for charterers to show an arguable and bona fide set-off uh defence uh for the purpose of resisting an interim award

The fact that they failed to do so at that stage does not preclude them uh from doing so uh or from establishing their cross-claim by further evidence before any final award is made

Now in the present case the phrase interim award has been used or may have been understood to be used uh in another sense

When an arbitration is proceeding concurrently with a time charterparty successive instalments of hire become due i

in this case it was every fifteen days uh during that period

Here uh the owners were claiming the the first instalment which was paid and then the second and the third instalments of hire on the basis that there would have to be after redelivery a final settlement of account

Therefore an award in respect of instalments as they fall due is interim rather than final i in the rather different sense uh that a final award uh will become necessary in respect in in the event that they are disputed in respect of the final charterparty account when the vessel is redelivered at some future date

I assume here  uh that the arbitrators have jurisdiction only in respect of an ac of accrued causes of action that is to say in respect of those instalments of hire uh which have already become due and as I 've already said that there is a separate cause of action in respect of each instalment

It follows from those assumptions uh that arbitrators cannot have jurisdiction in fu tu turo futuro that is to say to make any award in respect of the final charterparty accounts until such time as redelivery has taken place and the sums due on the final settlement of account have been established

It also follows from what I have said uh that the arbitrators uh must have authority to make an award in respect of each instalment of hire as it falls due

Their authority or their jurisdiction is consensual

uh

and therefore the agreement between the parties must be one which confers upon them an authority which is wide enough to include all the instalments of hire in respect of which they have thought to make awards whether those awards are interim or final 

It seems to me that that was the nub of the problem uh which is has arisen in this case

The arbitrators were first appointed when two instalments were due and unpaid

Subsequently they made their interim final award uh when six further instalments  had become due further to the first instalment

It is not alleged that there was any express agreement to widen their initial jurisdiction sufficiently to include those subsequent further instalments

And therefore the question and the issue is as to the scope of what agreement should be implied in the circumstances of the present case

If there was no agreement beyond the initial agreement uh then the arbitrators were restricted to making an award in respect of two instalments of the hire which is what the charterers contend

On the other hand if their jurisdiction or their authority was extended as successive instalments became due uh then they did have the jurisdiction which they uh exercised uh to make an award in respect of the initial two plus a further four instalments making a total of six

The owners submit uh that that is the true uh analysis of the present case

They the owners were demanding payment of instalments as they fell due or became due up to the date of the award

They say that the owners responded to those claims without protest or without any protest

it was sufficiently clear

and not made too late

The charterers on the other hand say uh

we never agreed to extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators in that way





This being a dispute about the scope of the authority of the arbitrators uh the relevant principles of law uh uhm were outlined uh by Mr Justice Devlin as he then was in whatever in the Westminster case that is Westminster Chemicals and Produce Limited against  and Leuter nineteen fifty-four One Lloyds Reports page ninety-nine 

The learned judge there distinguished two different questions between two different questions 

On the one hand there may be a question as to the scope of an agreement to arbitrate 

Colloquially uh the  uh question which then arises is

had I the relevant party agreed to submit this dispute to arbitration

But on the other hand uh there may be a dispute as in that case involved as to the scope of the authority which was actually conferred upon an arbitrator uh when the parties appeared before him and submitted to his jurisdiction

Then the relevant question is

what authority did I confer 

Uh

one notes in passing uh that the law permits a party who does appear  to do so under protest provided the protest is made early and loudly enough so as to prevent any submissio any such appearance from amounting to a submission to the authority of the arbitrator in law

The defendants however say that uh  the identities of the ingredients  for uh  this compound  would be discoverable by  analysis  a and were never treated  uh in Syntec two  as being in any way secret 

Uh  Mr Name 's employees have uh sworn affidavit  saying that uh  they were  in the course of their employment  uh perfectly familiar  uh with the  identities of the  relevant oil and uh  silica comp silica 

And uh no-one ever suggested to them  uh that this was a secret  uh which they could not use in any subsequent employment 

Uh

the defendants say that uh  uh if it were the case  that uh  any former employee of the company  uh was at liberty to use this information  uh there would be no reason why they  as former directors  uh should be in any worse a position 

Uh

I don't think that it 's uh  necessary or desirable  uh for me to  go into the uh details  uh which uh point uh  either  to the formulation being a a secret  uh or to  uh it being  uh  part of the  uh information which  uh any employee  uh would be uh  a at liberty to use  uh because uh  it doesn't seem to me that I could  uh come to any  final conclusion on the matter  o on the affidavit evidence which is now before me 

The plaintiff it seems to me has uh  an arguable case  uh for claiming that this information was secret  a and also  uh this being a separate difficulty which the plaintiff faces  an arguable case for saying  that the right to enforce that duty  uh has been assigned uh to the plaintiff  u under the agreement with the administrators 

Uh

having said that I must also say  that uh  the defendants  uh clearly on the evidence  uh have uh an equally arguable defence 

It is only  uh a crowd reaction  uh which can determine  uh whether they are in truth  uh seeking to take for their own purposes  uh information which uh  uh any honest director  would 've realised  uh belonged exclusively uh to the former company  o or whether the plaintiff  uh is seeking to stifle  uh competition  uh from persons who are  doing no more  than uh use the expertise  uh which they have uh acquired uh  uh in their trade 

The uh  question which uh  therefore uh arises  uh is  uh whether in accordance with the principles from the Name decision  uh an interlocutory injunction should be granted  to restrain the defendants from continuing  uh to  deal  uh in Unigel two forty  uh pending  the determination of the merits of the case 

Uh the guidelines in the  case require me to consider  first  uh whether uh damages uh would be an adequate remedy  for the plaintiff  if it were successful at the trial 

Uh if they would be uh then uh the enquiry goes no further  uh because uh  an injunction  uh is unnecessary 

The plaintiff claims that uh  unless the defendants are restrained  uh they would pending trial be damaged in a number of ways 

Uh first and most obviously  uh they would lose business 

Uh according to the  uh defendants  uh T C L uh has uh indicated to them  uh perhaps not surprisingly  uh that they would prefer not to be dependent upon a a single uh supplier 

Uh and the defendants say that they at present  supply about half of uh T C L 's  requirements 

Uh the plaintiffs dispute this  and say that it only comes to about a quarter 

Uh an assumption that they supply a half is however more I think more favourable than the plaintiff 's when looking at the question of damages 

Uh I was told  uh that uh  the quantity of product  uh supplied by the defendants  uh is worth about forty three thousand pounds a quarter 

Uh if one assumes that the  uh plaintiff  uh would pick up the whole of this business  uh then uh  the loss which it would suffer  uh without an injunction  uh is whatever would be the profit on that figure 

Uh I was not uh given any information about what the profit margin might be 

It is however by no means certain that uh  the plaintiff would pick up the whole of that business 

Uh T C L were as I 've said looking for another supplier  uh 

if they can no longer  buy from the defendant  uh they may well find someone else  uh a and there was uh  some confidential evidence  to suggest that another supplier was in the offing 

Uh taking it as best though  uh there is uh evidence to suggest  that in the absence of an injunction  uh the plaintiffs would suffer a loss of profit  uh along the lines that I 've uh  indicated 

The plaintiffs also uh uh put forward  less tangible heads of uh damage 

Uh they say that uh  loss of their monopoly position in relation to  Reagel Ninety S F  would in itself be damaging  they might have to discount their prices to  retain their market share 

This is uh at present  uh somewhat speculative uh because there 's no evidence that they have in fact done so uh in the face of the competition uh from the defendants so far 

Uh they also claim that uh  their reputation would suffer  uh if the rival product uh  were allowed to appear 

Uh but I h have some difficulty uh  in understanding why that should be so 

Uh it seems to me that the  uh plaintiffs ' uh only really likely uh head of damage  uh relates to loss of business 

Now in the ordinary way  uh the damage so suffered  would be uh quantifiable  uh and recoverable a as damages 

There is however  evidence from the plaintiffs  which is uh not really controverted by the defendants  uh that uh  the first defendant  uh is not a a  a particularly well-capitalised company 

Uh it uh  has only just started its business  apparently with the aid of uh  a facility from the National Westminster Bank 

Uh a

and uh the plaintiffs say  and the defendants don't as I say deny  uh that it is unlikely that any awarded damage  damages  would be satisfied 

I I know little uh  about the personal means of the two defendants  uh except for  uh some evidence on behalf of the  uh plaintiffs  of uh  uh outstanding transport judgements  uh against the second defendant  uh which again doesn't encourage one to think  that an award of damages uh would be met 

Uh for those reasons it 's not possible for me to dispose of the matter at the first stage of the Name process on the grounds that damages would be an adequate remedy for the plaintiffs 

Uh I next consider  whether i if an injunction were to be granted  uh damages would be an adequate remedy for the defendants 

Uh here there can be no difficulty  about ability to pay 

The plaintiffs as I 've said are a very substantial company 

But the  uh defendant 's evidence  uh is  uh that uh the sale of Unigel Two Forty constitutes at present  ninety five per cent of its business 

It naturally hopes to expand into other products and to find other customers 

Uh

but for the moment  the uh  loss of its ability to sell that product  uh to that customer  uh would in practice  be a a fatal blow  uh to its  uh business 

Now it 's true that uh  the worst scenario uh need not necessarily come to pass 

Uh the company could survive  uh with the support of its bankers  uh or possibly as in the case of its uh  predecessor Syntec Two  uh in administration 

Uh

I needn't speculate about the likelihood of uh  these outcomes  uh because it it 's sufficient I think to say  uh that uh  there is in my view  uh a substantial risk  that the effect of an injunction  uh would be to deprive the defendants  o of the means  uh to uh carry on the proceedings uh any further 

Uh Mr Moss did suggest that uh  the fact that  uh the injunction  uh might uh drive defendants into liquidation or bankruptcy  didn't necessarily mean that damages weren't uh an adequate remedy 

That remedy could always be pursued  uh by the liquidator or trustee 

This again is possible 

But uh  I think it would  be quite unrealistic  uh to ignore the fact  uh that uh  the supervening liquidation or bankruptcy  uh would make it uh very unlikely  that the action would be carried on  uh simply to recover damages on the cross undertaking in damages 

In my view therefore  uh damages would not  be an adequate remedy for the defendants  uh if they turned out at the trial to be right 

I I must therefore consider the matter  o on the general balance of convenience  uh in accordance with the Name guidelines 

Uh

that means  uh having regard to  the  uh course which is  least likely  to uh cause injustice  uh if it turns out at the trial  that uh an injunction  uh should or should not have been granted 

If I refuse the injunction  a and it turns out at the trial that the plaintiff was right  there is a risk  possibly a high risk  uh that the plaintiff will be unable to recover his damages 

Uh

if I grant an injunction  uh and it turns out at the trial  o or more realistically it would 've turned out at the trial  that the defendants were right  uh then it seems to me that there is a a a risk  uh that the defendants will have been uh put out of business  uh before or even without  the merits of the trial having been investigated 

Now as between a a a large and prosperous company on the one hand  and uh two uh individual defendants who 're seeking to start up in business  a after previous commercial failure o on the other  i it 's uh my judgement  that the uh injustice which may be caused by  the erroneous grant of an injunction  is considerably greater  than that which would be caused  if it were to be  mistakenly refused 

Mr Moss referred me to uh the passage in the Name case  in which uh  Lord Diplock uh said that uh where other factors appear to be equally balanced it was a counsel of prudence to take measures calculated to preserve the status quo 

The status quo as he said  uh was that uh the plaintiffs were established in the business  a and the defendants were interlopers who 'd just arrived 

From the defendants ' point of view however it doesn't look that way at all 

The status quo for them is that they are in business  and the plaintiffs want to drive them out 

The fact that it depends on the way you look at it  uh probably explains  uh why I 've never yet heard an application for an interlocutory injunction in which both sides weren't claiming to uphold the status quo 

In any event I have to decide the case o on the assumption that the defendants may turn out to be right  a

and if that i if that is the case  uh it 's never a very attractive argument  uh to say  uh that uh  because the plaintiffs hold the field there 's no competition  uh therefore  that is how matters should continue 

I I don't therefore find consideration to the status quo  uh of very great assistance uh in this case  uh

and I prefer to decide it  o on what seems to me uh to be the balance of relative justice and injustice  uh as I 've uh  tried to explain it 

Uh for those reasons the motion will be dismissed 

This is an appeal by the charterers V B O Subtract brought by leave of Mr Justice Hobhouse granted on February the twenty-second nineteen ninety one against the interim final award of the arbitrators in favour of the owners Coral Sea Enterprises S T A dated the seventeenth of December nineteen ninety

The vessel i in question was under a time charter dated the twenty-fifth of November nineteen eighty eight

She 's called The Alpha Challenge and the arbitrators were asked to decide questions of principle arising out of the vessel 's arrest and detention at Bidi in India i in a at the end of nineteen eighty eight in December I think

The question essentially concerns the true construction of Clause Sixty-Three of the Charter Party which was in the following terms

quote



Uh

he estimated the slope at the time in nineteen eighty-four to 've been something like one in four  a a

and it sloped down  uh for  uhm a distance of uhm uh  I think for three or four  uhm feet or possibly more  than the length of the slope

It may even have been uh  uh up to about two yards 

Now because of the uneven ground and because of the  liability to rut and uhm also because of this slope  the  ground  was plainly  uh uh and this seems to have been uh common ground between the witnesses who were called in this case  uhm a bad place for  stacking  uh these lintels and beams 

Uh uh and the reason why it was a bad place is obvious 

Uh the uh uh beam the stacks were liable to become unstable particularly when  uh the forklift truck was being used  uhm for taking the beams away 

Beams were taken away from one side and the stack was leaning to some extent 

then over the stack would go and the beams would all fall to the ground 

Uh

on other occasions uh during the course of loading  uh there would be minor collisions between the forklift trucks and these stacks

and the beams would go over in that way 

And the consequence of that was  that at  fairly frequently it became necessary to tidy this place  uh up 

Now this tidying up usually took place when the factory machine broke down and the gang in the factory would be then available for the tidying up operation 

And uh when that happened the men in the factory  uhm would uhm go outside

and in uhm  usually working it two at a time they would set about tidying up these beams 

Well now how did this accident happen  if it did happen 

Uhm the plaintiff gave evidence 

Uh and I say at once that uh he struck me  as a truthful man

He was described by his foreman who gave eviden gave evidence on behalf of the  defendant as a a a hard-working man uh and a uhm a a very good worker 

Uhm and uh  Martin Cook struck me

He was a s obviously had been a strong man and well built 

a a And he 's told me that he had always laboured in the building industry

And of course he was in his very early thirties at the time of this accident 

Uh he said this in the course of his evidence  and I read from my notes 

He was shown photograph three  and he said  the road on the right was very uneven and caused the loaded lintels to joggle about on the forks 

And then a little later in his evidence he said this 

that 's the the job of tidying up













And there was a lot of lifting to be done  uh  and he  pointed to photograph four to show how lintels could be crossed 

And he said the uhm ground conditions uhm  were in fact very uneven 

And he told me about complaints that were made to Mr  uh Peter Smith  uh his foreman at the time 

Now coming to the day of the accident he told me that uh in the morning he had been working there with his brother Paul  uh

And uhm  uhm  uh and they were tidying up the lintels 

And there came a time when Paul was taken away 

This was uhm sometime around about or just after dinner time 

And uh  uh Mr Wallace Chris Wallace who was another charge hand brought  David Martin round 

Uh

he said that

uhm 

when David was helping he he said that his back was giving him trouble 

And uhm he described to me that uhm  when uhm  he was working with David Martin  uhm  uh that they uhm uh managed with the lighter beams 

And then he said 

when David was helping he said his back was giving him trouble

and I told him to drive the forklift truck 

I should have mentioned that they had a forklift truck which they also were using uh in this tidying up process 

And wherever they could get the forklift truck into position so that they could load beams onto it or drive the forklift under the beams of course they used it 

But uhm because of the nature of the ground it it became impossible to use the forklift 

Uh and it was then that uh they had to do this manhandling 

Uh

and then he said this 

H he said

uhm

with any difficult ones I tried to manage on my own 







He said I was trying to get the lintel on the level  so that it could be picked up by the fork lift  uh





Uh h  he said that uhm

And he described i in uhm uh  uh detail  uhm how he had been uhm  endeavouring to or indeed had picked up this uh lintel  uhm which was one of the hundred and sixty-eight pound lintels or thereabouts  himself  uh in order to get it up the slope uh i in order to get it into a position where it could be uhm uh put back o on to the fork lift truck 

And it was then that he felt a sharp pain 

He said

I stepped back uhm uh

uh

and it was an uneven footing

He says

I wasn't really concerned at the time



Uh

and he told me that he 'd felt a pain in the buttock and uh uhm in hi the lower part of his back 







And he told me that that night he had woken up about three o'clock in the morning uh suf with pain in his knee cap 

He then said I hobbled in to work the next day 











The pant the plant was still broken down 

On the following day the Friday  he told me  uh that uhm  uh  uh that was the day th th that he uhm was taken home from work 

Now if I can just uh pause there 

Mr Henwood gave evidence  in this case

And he was the acting foreman 

Now before I come to Mr Henwood 's evidence  uhm  the plaintiff was carefully cross-examined by Mr Wheatley  uh about the way in which he said this accident happened 

And uhm I read from my notes of the cross examination by Mr Wheatley 

He said there were always two on the clearing up















And a little uhm later on when he was uhm still being cross-examined he said

I got David to drive the fork lift while I was manhandling the lintels















Now Mr Henwood his foreman gave evidence

And uh it 's uh helpful if I  note what Mr Henwood said about this  in the course of his evidence 

He was called by the defendants 

He said

from time to time men would go and tidy up the yard 















That being what the rest of the work force have done also 







And he was referring to the accident book which has been exhibited in this case

I think exhibit D Four 



Mr Henwood went on to say this that he had himself frequently grumbled about the state of the yard 

He said that he was a labourer and a working foreman 

Uhm we u had all expected it to be concreted to make a better working surface 

Uhm every one of us complained about the yard 

Uh he later told me in the course of his cross-examination that he didn't think there had been any change i in the ground  uhm uh between the  date of the accident and the photograph uh with the exception I think of the  uhm  the slope 

And he said that in nineteen eighty-four he  the foreman knew that accident  uh accidents were happening through lifting the lintels 

Uh he

he told me a little later in his evidence which was when he was being cross-examined that they that 's the workmen regularly lifted in excess of a hundred and fifty pounds on their own

There was no policy  as to this

Sometimes we lifted together and others and and sometimes alone 

Now in the light of uhm uhm Mr Henwood 's evidence  uh it 's plain to me  uh that  the men in this yard including the plaintiff  uhm uh really were left to re their own devices as to how they did this lifting 

Uh when they were tackling heavier weights  generally there would be two men  lifting but uhm frequently as I find  uh they would  uhm tackle these heavy weights on their own 

And uhm I 'm quite satisfied that on the uh the day of this accident  and I do find that there was an accident suffered by the plaintiff  on that uh Wednesday I think the tenth of October  uhm when he was uhm  tackling  uh the job of moving one of these heavy beams  uhm into a position where it could be uhm uh loaded onto the fork lift truck 

And he was doing it on his own as I find  because the man who was helping him  uhm that 's uhm  the  witness uh David Martin  uh because uh of  a pain in his back uh was uh sitting uhm on the fork lift truck a and was not uhm uh uhm engaged in helping him doing the lifting 

And that of course was with the consent of the plaintiff  uh who uh allowed him to do that because o of uhm  uh the pain he felt in his back 

Now David Martin gave evidence in this case  uh

And again I found him uh uhm a  truthful man  and a truthful witness 

Uh he was cross-examined particularly  uh  about a statement that he signed uhm which was prepared  presumably following a an interview  uhm  uh with a representative of the defendant 's insurance company 

Uh

and uhm  in that statement which has been put in

uh

uh

He was cross-examined on that statement and it 's before me 

Uh it 's uhm  exhibit 

No that 's exhibit D Four

the uhm 

What what name what number did we give the accident 

D Three yes 

Yes yes 

A a and uhm  uhm  it was pointed out to Mr Martin  uh in the course of his cross-examination  that in this statement he made no mention of the fact of uhm uh  uh sitting out  while the plaintiff uh was lifting this heavy weight 

He conceded that he had signed this statement 

And he conceded that the statement was uh what he had said to the uh insurance company  representative 

And he said

I cannot understand why I didn't have in the statement about my sitting down 

Uhm

he said

the document is not a lie 

but the truth is what I have said today in evidence



Well it 's not for me to  speculate as to why  the uhm  business about sitting down is not in his in this uh statement  uh which is a typewritten statement uh prepared by the insurance company representative and which Mr  uhm  uh Martin undoubtedly signed 

But uh I 'm satisfied uhm having seen and heard David Martin in the witness box  that he is basically a truthful man

And I am satisfied that in fact he was  not helping Mr  uhm Cook at the time of the accident  uh and uhm  uh that Mr Cook was endeavouring to lift indeed did in fact succeed in lifting  this heavy beam uh when he uhm uh suffered uh a sudden pain in the back 

Now it 's quite clear that the pain was not sufficient at that time to cause him to immediately to stop work uh uh and to uh report the matter as an accident 

It is notorious uh that uhm back injuries of this stor sort don't always manifest the seriousness of them do not uh do not doesn't become manifest at once 

Uh he continued

Uh it 's not clear what he was doing after he had suffered this back pain 

It 's probable that he didn't do any attempt any more lifting that day but the evidence is silent about that 

Now what is clear is that uhm  two days after this accident Mr Henwood in the day book which he kept  recorded  uhm  under the entry  Friday the twelfth of October and this is document D two that Mr Cook or M Cook went home because he has a nerve trapped in his back

Uh and then the words or the letters ten o'clock

Figures and words ten o'clock 

According to the evidence the witness uhm Mr Wallace took him home that afternoon uh that morning in his car 

Uhm uhm Mr Christopher Wallace uhm gave evidence for the  defendants  and he said uhm that I ran into the station that day the twelfth of October



Uh

Mr Wallace told me that he remembered complaints about the lintels in the stacking area being on the ground  uh and that uhm that uhm men generally were moaning about uh the cleaning up in that uh yard 

Now on that same day it is agreed this is the twelfth of October it 's agreed between the parties that uhm Mr Cook 's general practitioner made a note in uhm the medical notes uh and that the note reads

or it begins

and I won't attempt to read the whole of the note because I haven't seen it

but it 's been read to me

But the note begins

strained low back at work I think two days ago 

I 'm told that the general practitioner is now dead 

uh

and uhm if it had been necessary for that note to have been admitted in evidence it would have been uhm readily admitted in evidence under the provisions of the Civil Evidence Act 

It is for that fact and because of that  that the matters which arose in the criminal trial in my position  are central  because they bear upon the credibility of Mr Maynard 

They are not as my learned friend has submitted  peripheral 

My Lord as far as Lancaster was concerned it is clear from the evidence  that both Mr Maynard and Mr Caine  have been dealing with Mr Maynard and the case officer and the person in overall control  were fully aware of the involvement of Mr Wilson  between March and August nineteen eighty-four

That 's a period of almost five months  during which time he and his colleagues that is Mr Wilson and others had been under observation by both the police and customs officers 

It was clearly important to all concerned with the criminal investigation  the prosecution and in particular the defence at that trial  that what happened between February and August nineteen eighty-four should be known 

My Lord that is plain from the manner in which the questions were put to the officers and the manner in which they  answered them in these proceedings 

My Lord the case summary would have been prepared in the usual way upon consultation with those instructing leading counsel for the Crown 

It was misleading

It was inaccurate 

Leading counsel was not either before the trial or during the trial acquainted with the full picture 

It wasn't a mere technicality as Mr Maynard attempted to paint it

It was a serious omission 

I accept that an explanation was given to the Liverpool Crown Court  but in my submission that explanation was wholly  insufficient 

To simply say that communication had been given to one solicitor another solicitor had taken over and she didn't know of those facts  is not enough in my submission 

Mr Maynard was aware of what was in the summary

He was present not during the opening but he was present during the majority  of the Crown case

He knew what was not being said  and in my submission must have known of its importance

Your Lordship knows from Mr Caine that the matters did not come to light because at some late stage  the breakdown in communication  was realised  that it did not come to light because it came belatedly from the customs officers and through their counsel 

It came to light because word was given to defence counsel from defendants  and the matter was put forward to Crown counsel 

It is unfortunate to have to put it in this way but on what Your Lordship knows  there was a withholding  of essential evidence in the course of that trial

He could have brought those matters to the attention of prosecuting counsel at any stage either before or during the trial 

And so My Lord I should tell you this

You may not be aware of it  but Wilson and others were involved with that vessel between March and August nineteen eighty-four

It wasn't done 

Now My Lord  in truth it could be said that it 's very difficult for anybody  jury counsel and witnesses to look into a mind of another person and explain satisfactorily and explain satisfactorily why somebody does something 

I can't give a satisfactory explanation as to why that should have occurred

It occurred and obviously in the criminal proceedings the customs officers paid the price  but My Lord it bears on these proceedings because it affects the credibility of Mr Maynard 

My Lord that is central to the issues Your Lordship has to decide because he was the one who decided that Wilson was the owner 

He was the one who decided that Wilson should be served with notice of seizure  and he was the one on whose evidence much of the matter before this court turns 

My Lord that is the first  issue which I raise and put before Your Lordship

Credit is important 

I will mention the obvious points  as to the weight to attach to the evidence of Payne and Watson 

That 's dealing with credit 

And my learned friend quite rightly and quite properly  invited me to look at the evidence of the plaintiff  and consider what weight to give to them 

He has mentioned the fact that Mr Walling was tarnished 

He 's tarnished by what happened with the voyage on the  by the fact that he served a substantial period of imprisonment 

but he is still as Your Lordship will appreciate entitled to stand in this court

I say that Mr Maynard knew full well I was the owner

My Lord can I deal perhaps  with

My Lord  as far as his credit and the importance of his credit is concerned it also is of relevance when considering the evidence given by Mr Holt  because there is a clear conflict between the two of them

Your Lordship has to decide



Well my Lord it 's clearly not as marked as it would appear in the pleadings 

My Lord I did mention that there were two central issues and that I wanted to deal with those at the outset 

The first bit was the position of Mr Maynard and his credit and in particular what occurred at Lancaster 

The second point My Lord

and it 's a matter of law 

and it relates to the submissions that my learned friend has made under paragraph three of the schedule two nineteen seventy-nine A

My Lord he addressed you and placed his submissions with you in this way  that even though Mr Walling had not been served with notice he was still under paragraph three of the schedule  a person who was entitled to give a counter notice  under that paragraph that the vessel was not liable to seizure 

That had not been how I had read that provision

Your Lordship will see that paragraph three  reads

any person claiming that anything seized as liable to forfeiture is not so My Lord shall within one month of the date of the notice of seizure or  when no such notice has been served on him  within one month of the date of the seizure give notice of his claim

It the provision when no such notice has been served on him

In my submission that has to be read in conjunction with paragraph one two  which expressly provides for the circumstances in which no notice need be served  which would be where the  thing to be seized  was seized in the presence of the person whose offence or suspected offence occasioned the seizure  or the owner of the thing seized or in the case of  seizure the ship or aircraft the master or commander 

My Lord that was I confess how I uh read the provision  set out in paragraph three  that it related back to provisions in paragraph one which expressly provide for the serving of notice  save as is provided in paragraph one two that notice need not be served in certain circumstances

Those circumstances  do not apply in this case  because it 's not suggested that the ship was seized in the presence of Mr Walling 

And in my respectful submission if those circumstances do not apply then paragraph three does not apply 

My Lord before I move on to specific issues a further matter

The third one which is a point which is really a fact  is this

That it has been said  and urged upon you by my learned friend that when looking at the suggestion that has been made  to Mr Maynard that he knew Walling was the owner but chose to serve someone who he knew was not the owner

what would be his motive 

My Lord I say at the outset that the only motive that would appear and that I can put to him and have done  is that he was as he conceded frustrated  and angered by Mr Walling 's  line in interview 

Mr Walling was not telling him the truth he felt 

He believed

He may have decided in pique  because of the obstructive nature of Mr Walling in the interview  that he would teach him a lesson by getting rid of the boat

I know not 

It should not  rule out of the question the plaintiff 's prospect of success in this action simply because he cannot provide a satisfactory motive 

But I 've already indicated My Lord  why people decide to do things are not always for the most logical reasons 

and it is difficult to look into somebody 's mind and ascertain why somebody should do what he has done 

My Lord I accept having said that that of course Your lordship will look towards a motive  to establish on balance of probabilities whether something has occurred

My Lord shall I  then and make submissions as to the issues before you firstly under the heading of  the use  to which this vessel was put

My learned friend relied on a number of facts  of establishing he says beyond  doubt that this vessel had been used to import prohibited drugs

My Lord he relied on the forensic evidence

In my submission the forensic evidence that is and was available is inconclusive

I rely upon Dr Williamson 's evidence

I accept that there were traces of cannabis found in the samples that were recovered from the vessel 

but as to whether or not  those traces of cannabis and those samples are evidence from which a court could infer importation  the only piece of evidence Your Lordship has to rely on is really the appearance of the stem as Mr Neal conceded in cross examination

It is a point which might suggest

but My Lord that vessel was for a length of time the court knows  on the port at the port of Fort Henry and didn't anywhere

People could have boarded it people could have used it to conceal drugs

That is not wild speculation



Well My Lord there isn't any evidence to support it

And of course as Mr Neal conceded  seeds and stems would not contain cannabis and would be the first things to be thrown away

They may have spilt out of bags  when they were imported

but there are other explanations  for why they are where they were

My Lord as far as the stem is concerned Your Lordship has the evidence of Dr Williamson  who saw the same appearance as Mr Neal 

she a botanist

he a chemist

She did not consider that that appearance assisted one way or the other as to origin

Mr Neal conceded in cross examination  that as far as  the appearance of the stem is concerned it would be consistent with the species

Your Lordship will recall his evidence 

and it would be quite possible for seeds which are used to grow cannabis in west Africa  to be planted in other areas possibly even the United Kingdom

and the cannabis plants one would grow  would have the same physical appearance of the stem

It 's a fingerprint

It 's a characteristic of that species of plant

If that is right then it cannot be said  with any degree of certainty or even on balance of probabilities that simply on this particular piece of evidence  that that vessel had been used to import cannabis from west Africa



Yes it could have been and Mr Neal accepted that

He would say that if it was grown over here it would be lighter in colour 

but My Lord he accepted that the best age he could give to the cannabis was between one and twelve years

And it was in such a state that really the colour didn't help in one way or the other

So My Lord in my submission the finding of cannabis on the vessel  are no more than inconclusive  as far as the question of whether this vessel has been used to import cannabis is concerned

My Lord the  alleged celebratory party at the Lily Hotel again on the evidence that is before the court  is inconclusive

There is the evidence of Mr Payne  and I 'll come to that in a moment  but My Lord the evidence that has been given by Mr O  Mr O'Reilly 's alleged comment to Mr Cayton in interview  doesn't really take the case any further on this particular regard

The evidence of Mr Cayton was that it was  that it was to celebrate the drugs run

He said I think from memory I am sure you are right but I did not know

I was not there

And it was a reply that Mr O'Reilly disputed when he gave evidence

He said he 'd never said that

Your Lordship will recall that

My Lord as far as Mr Walling 's lack of concern about the vessel

again  that was a very small point which in my submission doesn't take the case any further

This is an appeal  from  an order  uh made on the twenty-fifth of uh May  uh of uh this year by the Registrar in the Romford County Court  uh that uh  Mr  Leonard Jerome Daniel be adjudged bankrupt 

It was an unusual petition in the sense that it was  brought by  the supervisor  uh of uhm  a voluntary arrangement  and not by a creditor 

Section two hundred and sixty-four of the Insolvency Act Nineteen Eighty-Six  lists the persons who may present a bankruptcy petition 

and uh the third in the list is  by the supervisor of or any person other than the individual who is for a time being bound by a voluntary arrangement proposed by the individual and approved under part eight 

In relation to such petitions  section two hundred and seventy-six  sub-section one  says this



Pausing for a moment there

it was submitted to me uhm by uh  Mr Millet on behalf of the supervisor  uh that uh  there could be an overlap i i in that  the sort of conduct which is aimed at in section two seven six one B  false or misleading information or m material omissions  uh could come within uh sub-paragraph C a a as  constituting a failure to do all such things as might for the purposes of the voluntary arrangement have been reasonably required of by  of him by the supervisor 

I don't accept that submission

It seems to me that  the separate statement of those three categories of ground  uh for making  uh a an order on a petition are intended to be disparate  uh a and that uh  C deals with a failure to do what the supervisor has asked you to do

And it is i i i i in my judgement  uh  necessary to show for C  that there  has been a reasonable request by the supervisor  a a and a failure to comply with that request 

Uhm B deals with failure to do what one ought to do anyway 

The uh  background uh to the  uh matter which has been argued  a and uh relied on in the Registrar 's judgement  uh is a  confusing state of  cross claims between the debtor Mr Daniel on the one hand a and Mr Sigrani  uh with whom he had dealings on the other 

Uh Mr Sigrani  had i it would appear employed the debtor to do extensive uh electrical work 

A and uh Mr Daniel 's case uh was that there were  architects ' certificates uh outstanding 

The great majority o o of the certificates had been discharged  uh

but it would appear that Mr Daniel 's case throughout was that there were some that had not been satisfied or one at least uh 

On the face of it one dated the twenty-third of November nineteen eighty-eight in the sum of twenty thousand five hundred pounds a

and it may well be other matters too 

Mr Sigrani on the other hand had what appears to have been a a a uh  cast-iron case i in respect of the refunding to him of V A T  which he had paid on the basis that uh the works were not entitled to zero rating  a and which uh subsequently had turned out to be uh the subject of zero rating so that uh  e e eventually it became clear that Mr Daniel had been paid more V A T than was uh a a at the end of the day properly payable 

A and on that basis uh h he was liable to repay under the terms of an express agreement which uh had a term in it that uh no set-off was to be allowed against uh uhm  su such a claim for repayment of V A T 

Mr Sigrani issued a writ on the twenty-first of April nineteen eighty-nine to enforce his claim in relation to the V A T 

And shortly afterwards a a firm of solicitors called Denis and Till in uh  in uh Yorkshire in Malton in Maltby in Yorkshire uhm for whom uh uh a lady called Susan Fox acted  uh started to act for Mr Daniel 

A default judgement was obtained by Mr Sigrani on the sixteenth of June nineteen eighty-nine  uh uh that was uh  set aside  uh on the sixteenth of October by Master Prebble who ordered one that the judgement uh of the sixteenth of June be set aside  and two that the plaintiff be at liberty to enter judgement for forty-two thousand five hundred and eighty-nine pounds and ninety-six pence and scale costs 

Now the only effect of the setting aside  uh was to remove uh what had previously been in the default judgement a claim for interest in the sum of nine hundred and ninety-seven pounds and fifty pence 

Uh and that was done on the basis that the claim was premature and therefore shouldn't have carried interest 

But it from the sixteenth of October it was perfectly clear  uh that uhm the plaintiff uh was entitled to enter judgement for that capital sum of forty-two thousand five hundred and eighty-nine pounds and some pence 

And that indeed is what he did

Uh on the twenty-fourth of October judgement was entered in that sum a and uh for an additional sum in costs 

I in the meanwhile uh Mr Daniel who was uh in financial difficulties uh had been uh  negotiating for uh uh a voluntary arrangement uh a a as a possible way out of his difficulties 

Uh there was an interim order made uh on the twenty-seventh of uhm October nineteen eighty-nine and uh the voluntary arrangement was ultimately accepted by the creditors on the twentieth of November nineteen eighty-nine 

It 's not necessary to go into the details of that voluntary arrangement but uh i i it is clear that uh at first  there was a a a non-compliance  uh by Mr Daniel with some of the terms  which uh i included uhm  a a payment of uhm  V A T to o o o of the V A T refund uhm  to uh the supervisor

A a and that was held up for reasons it is not necessary at this stage to go into 

Uh  the petition i in this matter uh was presented on the twenty-eighth of December uh nineteen eighty-nine 

And uh  the details of the default  in paragraph three one uh of the petition uh are as follows 



Uh 

it 's not very felicitously expressed

but I i i interpret that  a as being  aimed at  paragraphs A and C uh of section two hundred and seventy-six one A being the debtor has failed to comply with his obligations under the voluntary arrangement a a a and C the debtor has failed to do all such things as made for the purposes of the voluntary arrangement had been reasonably required of him by the supervisor of the arrangement 

Uh 

the latter half o o of the statement in the petition i is  seriously defective uh i i i in that i i it isn't an abstract question of doing all that could be reasonably expected of him that has to be shown for paragraph C a a as I 've  stated earlier in this judgement and don't propose to repeat 

Uh I detect no trace uh of any suggestion at that point  uh o of uh  false or misleading information m misleading  uh but or misleading  uh matter or material omission 

But  the matter was supported by an affidavit  by uh the supervisor Mr Percival  uh which uh he saw on the twenty-fifth of April  nineteen ninety 

Uh he  uh gave an account of what happened in the past  uh and uh  in particular the details about the non-compliance with the financial aspect of the matter 

Uhm but he uh indicated uh that uh there had by then been uh  substantial payments 

And that aspect of the matter uh has effectively sunk from view because as will appear in a moment the Registrar found  uh uh that uh  there was really no significant default left 

Uh i i he described the arrears a as minimal  uh and therefore one needn't go into that aspect of the matter 

Uh what was said  i in the affidavit which is material i is uh this

It now transpires that Mr Sigrani had issued a writ against Mr Daniel on the twenty-first of April nineteen eighty-nine

Judgement had been uh obtained against him  uh i in the sum of  forty-two thousand five hundred and eighty-nine pounds and ninety-six pence on the sixteenth of June

Judgement was then set aside on the sixteenth of October and reinstated on the twenty-fourth of October 

And that was the position before the creditors approved the voluntary arrangement on the twentieth of November 

He then deposes to the fact that Mr Daniel swore an affidavit  uh which shows Mr Sigrani 's claim of forty-two thousand pounds was expected to rank as nothing notwithstanding the fact that at that time there was a judgement against him in the sum of just over forty-two thousand pounds 

Uh and he points out that no attempt had been made to set aside the judgement 

He concludes that it appears that Mr Daniel knew full well that Mr Sigrani had a valid claim and in order to enhance dividends to his creditors and to make the proposal more attractive he deliberately failed to disclose the full extent of Mr Sigrani 's debt 

The position now is that Mr Sigrani is attempting to obtain a charging order over the house the proceeds of which have already been promised to creditors under the arrangement 

Uh and then documents are uh uh uh exhibited in support of what 's said 

A and finally the affidavit says this

For all these reasons but in particular because he has failed to disclose the judgement against him I ask that the court make a bankruptcy order against Mr Daniel 

That was met by an affidavit  uh sworn by Susan Fox whom I mentioned earlier  i in the course of which she says uh this that she exhibits  some attendance notes  a and correspondence 

Uh of the attendance notes she says this in paragraph four of her affidavit dated the twenty-fourth of May 

The remaining items in the bundle of documents marked S F One are mainly notes of telephone conversations between myself and representatives of M J Miller and Co  i in which it can be seen that the omission of Jack Sigrani as the creditor in the initial voluntary arrangement was fully aired and discussed and he was at all times both before and after the voluntary arrangement  a creditor within the knowledge  o of M J Miller and Co 

I think one has to supply the words and of Mr Sigrani was at all times  etc 







Uh

the  attendance notes  kept by Susan Fox  uh are  so far as material three in number  one dated the tenth of October which it will be recalled is the period when the default judgement had not yet been  replaced by the leave to sign judgement for the capital sum without interest 

They had uh uh uh brought within the group two other companies which they have caused to be incorporated

and uh by the time with which I am concerned they 'd also acquired the business of another company in Tunbridge

and the uh group 's uh account nineteen eighty-five accounts uh which are before me show that they had net assets of over half a million at as of the t thirty-first of December nineteen eighty-five and that the companies ' shareholders

the issued share capital being about four four hundred and fifty thousand pounds was shown in another document to be predominantly uh Mr Hook and his wife with minor minor share interests being held by Mr Hunt who was the uh Finance Director of the group and a Mr Neiman who was a business associate who 'd also been involved in the growth of the Group

And Mr Hook told me that in nineteen eighty-six uh h his comp the company which had recently acquired the the company in Tunbridge was interested in expansion 

H h his evidence was that after buying uh uh the Tunbridge company he had uh contacted Mr Lehrer having seen one of his advertisements in the regular trade press

And he said that he asked Mr Lehrer come in for a general chat

He didn't have any reason to dispute this

might have just p uh occurred after a date in mid-September which was shown in the plaintiff 's office diary

And he and Mr Lehrer uh and Mr Hunt had a meeting at a local club 

And uh Mr Hook 's account of their meeting was that uh uh at the ma material time they were concerned with the possibility of acquiring uh new businesses as part of the expansion

And he didn't recall that they were involved in uh thinking of selling their business

he did recall that uh uh towards the end of the meeting Mr uh Lehrer told him uh asked him about the possibility of selling their business and told him that there were some quite large companies in the market who were interested in acquiring uh businesses in that field

And he said uh

uh

and uh when Mr uh Hook uh uh uh responded with polite interest uh Mr uh Lehrer mentioned the name of the defendant company which was well known to Mr Hook because he had had uh business dealings with Mr Lampitt uh as early as nineteen seventy-two when he was employed by Jays who uh visited Mr Lampitt 's company

And his reaction to this uh mention of Mr Lampitt 's company was that he was surprised that Mr Lampitt 's company were on the acquisition trail themselves

Uh they were a company who had been going for at least seventy-five years

And Mr  Hook 's view was that uh to a degree it would have been a change for Lampitt 's to have been thinking about expanding and acquiring another business

At all events uh he told me that that Mr Lehrer would have said to him do you mind if I put Lampitt 's in touch with you 

And his reaction was that although uh this wasn't a serious situation on on his part uh he is was uh quite interested in finding out uh from the marketplace the valuation of his company

And he said that it would be helpful to get a toe in the water to find out where they stood

and so that he uh allowed Mr uh Lehrer uh to take away some uh uh documents about his company with a view to sending them to Lampitt 's

And in due course he sent or caused to be sent to Mr Lehrer the uh  accounts of the group for nineteen eighty-five and also the accounts the most recent accounts of the Tunbridge company

Mr Lehrer 's account of that meeting  was that he and Mr Hook uh talked about their business that he had told them that he had a client who would like to talk to them about possible acquisition and he took away some notes and some extracts from their accounts

Uh  he said that uh his uh feeling was that uh Mr Hook and uh the other guy who was there who uh was Mr Hunt the Finance Director were uh talking about two different things to him at this meeting that Mr Hook was saying that he was interested in the further expansion of the Fernale bus Ferndale business

But in his experience in the marketplace many people say that they want to enlarge the company their company when in fact they are uh keen or willing or wanting uh to sell the company

And his view was that under a wish to under the guise of a wish to expand Mr Hook was coming to him as a seller  uh that he was very clearly interested in selling

and this was one of the reasons why they had uh gone away from the company 's premises to a h hall at the club to discuss the uh possibility of selling

And Mr Lehrer felt that if they had been in a truly expansionist uh mind uh he would have seen them at the company 's premises and people would have let uh and people would have been allowed to know that he was there and they would have had an eye to buying uh uh other people 's businesses 

At all events what is clear happened as a result of that meeting and what is clear did not happen is this

What happened was that Mr Lehrer sent to uh Mr Lampitt 's company details of uh Ferndale 's as a possible sub uh subject for acquisition and uh sent them uh the accounts which Mr Lehrer uh Mr uh Hook had sent him

What didn't happen was that Mr Lehrer didn't send Mr Hook any details at all of any companies which Mr Hook might buy as part of his uh uh uh wish to expand 

Mr 

The uh ca the uh uh documentmentary documentary evidence shows that on the eighth of October uh Mr Stuart who was by now the uh chief contact uh of the defendants with Mr Lehrer uh listed a number of questions about the Ferndale Group which required to be answered to enable them to proceed including a ra a request for the accounts of the uh uh of two of the companies in the Group

And uh the correspondence also shows how those accounts were sent in Octo on twenty-second of October nineteen eighty-six and passed on to Touche Ross on tenth of November ninety eighty-six and how in due course on the tenth of December nineteen eighty-six Mr Hunt on behalf of Ferndale wrote to Mr Lampitt saying

further to our recent telephone conversations we are sorry

but there is no way forward under the terms you suggest 

Mr Lampitt told me that he hadn't seen any details about the Ferndale Group being for sale until Mr uh Lehrer mentioned them to him 

He uh  heard that their uh discussions with uh Ferndale which uh were uh  made direct by M on Mr Lehrer 's encouragement uhm were all over the telephone

And he thought that there was a maximum of three or four telephone calls

There may have been slightly more uh

And uh Mr Lampitt 's uh memory of it was that uh when he spoke to Mr Hook Mr Hook uh a Mr Lampitt said uh

I understand you are interested in selling your company

Mr Hook said no we 're not

uh we 're uh uh thinking of exp wanting to expand the company and seeking an injection of cash 

And uh  in due course uhm  during these telephone calls uh Mr uh Hook returned to him with the suggestion that Lampitt 's would might invest  a million and a quarter or a million and a half uh in order to obtain fifty-one per cent of the shares in the Ferndale Group

This was in no way what uh the way in which Lampitt 's were uh contemplating uh acquiring another company  which they would uh draw into their business in the way which I 've described

And the the discussions came to an end

Mr Stuart told me that the uh proposition wasn't of any interest to them uh

the figures were quite out of kilter uh from what he 'd seen with anything which had been uh contemplated by Lampitt 's 

And Mr Stuart told me that uh the letter of the tenth of December was treated as the end of their of all their communications with Ferndale uh and thereaft that is as far as he was concerned concerned and thereafter at any rate for a long time he didn't have anything to do with Ferndale 

Through nineteen eighty-seven uh Mr Lehrer kept in contact with uh the uh  defendants

Uh from time to time he sent some dur details of possible new acquisitions uh

From time to time the defendants expressed interest in following one or more of these up

And from time to time on a fairly regular basis Mr Lehrer had conversations with Mr uh Stuart over the telephone 

He uh his memory was that he would ask Mr uh uh Stuart uh whether they were making any progress with a number of companies uh including uh Ferndale and uh Mr Stuart uhm would say that they they weren't or would give th e e information about the companies uh which they were following up

And in view of the exposed nature of a middleman working on a commission who has put uh the his principals in into touch with the compa direct touch with the company to whom he 'd introduced them it is hardly surprising that Mr Lehrer was trying to keep informed about the way things might or might not be going 

At all events uh and Mr Stuart doesn't recall any other uh mention of uhm Ferndale uh nothing at all happened uh about the possibility of the defendants acquiring the Ferndale Group until uh the end of nineteen eighty-seven 

At  in November nineteen eighty-seven there was a a distributors ' meeting for one of Lampitt 's suppliers which lasted a day and a half

And Mr Lampitt uh met Mr Hook but of course he 'd known well over uh whom he 'd known from time to time over the years at that meeting 

Mr Lampitt told me that there was no uh material discussion about the possibility of uh  his acquiring the Ferndale company at  at that meeting  and led me to understand that nothing of any materiality was discussed

Mr Hook on the other hand told me that he did have a uh long discussion with Mr uh Lampitt at that meeting about their uh  respective co about business in general and about their companies

and as a result of uh that discussion he was able to uh understand more clearly the strengths of each company

And uh he told me that uh he formed the view that it would be uh logically the right company for the Ferndale Group to be involved in with should uh the time come that uh  the Ferndale Group uh merged with another company 

In January nineteen eighty-eight Mr Hook telephoned Mr Lampitt  uh from what was called uh in uh uh from a hotel in Surrey

And Mr Lampitt told me that Mr Hook rang him up one day at his office and wanted to talk about his business because it had expanded and grown to such scale that his staff couldn't manage a business of this size and he felt that uh if it grew any more it would be quite beyond h him his capacity himself and he also had uh personal problems in relationship t to in relation to his relationship with his second wife who was uh herself uh deeply involved with the comp with the Group

And uh he asked the uh Mr Lampitt uh whether uh the defendant would be interested in buying the company

He said that he was making this approach with the agreement of the board 

And he said that uh Mr Hook had told him that he 'd been at the health farm for a fortnight worrying about what to do with his business and his uh private life that he was depressed and low and slightly at the end of his tether 

And Mr Hook 's evidence to me was uh to much the same effect

There was a crisis had blown up in January nineteen eighty eighty-eight

And uh  he was uh faced with the problem that either uh he had to make a clean sweep of the people running his company if he was to go on running it which would involve getting rid of uh directors and chief executors tives uh that is senior executives who were close personal friends or alternatively he would have to consider the feasibility of selling the business

And all in all he felt he 'd had enough 

And as a result of that the uh  parties had discussions uh at the on the insistence of Mr Lampitt 's financial advisors

The uh  Ferndale company accounts for these three years were sent to Touche Rosh Ross to stu study

And in due course on the twenty-seventh of June nineteen eighty-eight the uh  defendants acquired the Ferndale Group for a consideration of uh sixty six hundred thousand pounds plus uh a a and uh with the exchange of uh  shares in the defendant company which represented twenty per cent of the their issued total issued share share capital after some re-adjustments at the time of this share agreement till their issued share capital had been completed

And Mr Hook told me that uh he w had subsequently sold the l Lampitt shares which he had acquired as his part of these consideration shares 

Mr Lehrer came to hear about this uhm  share acquisition from a uh article in the trade press

And as a result of hearing about it he rang up Mr Stuart 

He 'd heard uh from Mr Stuart he said in April nineteen eighty-eight that uh Lampitt 's were talking to Ferndale again

But uh although Mr Stuart according to him promised to keep him informed he did not until he read uh this article

And uh when he rang Mr Stuart up and asked him about this Mr Stuart said yes it was true that the defendants acquired the Ferndale Group but he couldn't say how much had been paid and Mr Lampitt was away on a six week holiday and he could ask him after he came back 

Wh when after that six weeks Mr Lampitt said that he wasn't able to say what had been paid because of political reasons and uh he encouraged him Mr Lehrer if he was interested to approach Mr Lampitt

But Mr Lampitt uhm  was never available on the telephone when Mr Lehrer sought to uh speak to him

Uh he sought to speak to him a number of times in uh uh leading up to the sixteenth of uh September

Good evening

For the nineteenth day the allies maintain a relentless bombardment of targets in Iraq and Kuwait

The Iraqis say allied pilots are hitting civilian targets

The French report signs of chemical emissions after their bombing missions against chemical weapons plants

In summary these are tonight 's main developments from the Gulf War 

Iran 's President Rafsanjani offers to meet both Saddam Hussein and the Americans to sue for peace

An American battleship commences the shelling of on-shore targets in Kuwait 

The allies say they 've knocked out twenty-five tanks in an attack i inside Iraq 

The U S Defence Secretary rejects the notion that Saddam is winning by losing 

Tonight as a Kuwaiti citizen tells us from Kuwait City that it 's been a dull day there we look at what 's happened to the civilians in this war 

Our science correspondent investigates France 's concern that Iraqi chemical toxins may now be polluting the Gulf air 

We report Britain 's lack of enthusiasm for France and Germany 's proposal for a common European defence policy 

At home a looming crisis over caring for the elderly

The government comes under pressure to bring forward its plans for care in the community

And the impact on Israel of two hundred thousand Soviet immigrants with a million more on their way 

The U S commander in the Gulf General Norman Schwarzkopf says most of the civilian damage shown to Western reporters in Iraq has been caused by Iraq 's own air defence missiles which went astray 

He also says that senior Iraqi officers are moving their command posts into schools and other civilian buildings to protect them from allied air strikes

The question of civilian damage in Iraq has dominated the allied briefings in Saudi Arabia today

At the same time Iran 's President Rafsanjani who 's strongly condemned the bombing of Baghdad says he 'll meet President Saddam and renew contacts with America if it could lead to a peace process 

Our diplomatic editor Nick Gowing in London assesses Iran 's latest offer amid the allies ' continuing bombardments 

By appearing before a handful of Western journalists the Iranian president sought to end doubts in many Western governments that Iran would abide by its declared neutrality in the Gulf War

To those doubters President Rafsanjani invoked the name of Switzerland

Uncertainty about Iran 's intentions began after seven Iraqi war planes landed in Iran ten days ago leading to initial fears that Iran and Iraq had struck a secret deal

The Iranian president rejected any such notion

President Rafsanjani went on to explain the emergency circumstances in which the first Iraqi war planes arrived

The Iranian president said all Iraqi planes believed by U S intelligence to number eighty-nine will remain impounded until at least the end of the war

Having set the record straight Rafsanjani then went on to announce that although his weekend meeting with Iraq 's deputy Prime Minister Sadoum Hamadi had revealed no hint of Iraqi flexibility on Kuwait he had transmitted to Saddam Hussein a specific but undisclosed idea designed to end the Gulf War 

So after receiving a flurry of diplomatic visitors this weekend from the French foreign ministry from Iraq 's closest friends the Yemenis and from those secretive and often successful mediators the Algerians Iran is clearly trying to establish itself in a pivotal role to help determine the framework of a future peace in the Middle East

By talking of the possibility of even resuming direct contacts with the United States President Rafsanjani is even willing to break a decade of chill with the great Satan 

Meanwhile in the War itself once again the information we have today is sketchy and far from complete

But the signs are that around Kuwait itself allied forces are strengthening their strategic positions for the eventual assault in the methodical way that the allies said they would eventually

Remember the allies say their attacks on and destruction of Iraq 's naval vessels some stolen from Kuwait have now given them sea supremacy as well as air supremacy

The position of the World War Two battleship Missouri has not been disclosed but if her sixteen inch guns are bombarding Iraqi bunkers with their one ton shells she must be positioned offshore somewhere here within their range some twenty miles 

And that suggests confidence that air bombardment of Iraqi long-range artillery positioned along the Kuwait coast has significantly destroyed the danger from Iraqi shelling 

Today Channel Four news managed to make phone contact with a resident of Kuwait

Before he ended the call abruptly he described what he was seeing and hearing

Yesterday 's allied taking of Failaka Island which is nine miles long and strategically placed just off Kuwait not only removes an offshore Iraqi forward artillery position it also provides a vital forward position for the allied amphibious landings which are widely expected

The Pentagon has made clear that somewhere in the Northern Gulf assault ships carrying up to twenty thousand marines are in advanced stages of preparing for such an operation 

Meanwhile allied war planes continue to pound Iraqi targets inside Kuwait in anticipation

Today British Jaguars continued to attack sites housing Chinese-built anti-ship Silk Worm missiles something they 've been doing for more than a week now

The R A F say the Iraqis have numerous such sites right down to the Saudi border

Meanwhile British Tornadoes have continued to defy heavy anti-aircraft fire and surface-to-air missiles on the new daylight missions

Continuing efforts to destroy road and rail bridges and convoys on Iraq 's supply lines to its Kuwait forces 

Those Iraqi supply lines pass through the city of Basra location of Saddam Hussein 's southern command headquarters also headquarters of Iraq 's navy 

These Iraqi television pictures received today appear to confirm reports from Iranian sources nearby just across the border that Basra continues to receive a sustained pounding from allied bombers as eyewitnesses who 've just reached Jordan confirm

More broadly in what the military jargon calls the K T O the Kuwait theatre of operation there is scant detail of what remains a sustained allied bombing effort to as the military say degrade Iraqi forces

Near Kuwait 's  oilfield U S marines attacked Iraqi radar and infantry positions and exchanged fire in a separate engagement

It was part of the pattern of skirmishes as allied artillery and infantry edge forward for the expected ground offensive

Meanwhile American sources suggest that the relentless pounding of the Republican guard by B Fifty-Two bombers has produced no sign yet of weakness in Saddam Hussein 's crack unit

It is an assessment repeated by the British

They are taking certainly a a real hammering uhm uh but they are elite troops uh

they 're uhm well trained

they 've got good weapons a and they will certainly have made sure over the last five months they 're as well protected as they possibly b can be in their positions to withstand something like this 

But the bombardments continue without let-up

On average two thousand sorties a day

This was Baghdad last night

Six hours of bombing in the Iraqi capital 's south-east suburbs 

Iraq claimed it downed nine allied war planes 

In allowing a handful of Western journalists to film civilian damage like this row of shops and transmit it round the world Saddam Hussein is has succeeded in getting the question raised to the coalition 's military leaders 

Why are non-military targets like this mosque being hit by allied bombing when commanders say weaponry is accurate enough to avoid such casualties and damage





The questioning of military targeting is becoming more pointed by the day

Last night I T N showed these pictures of a school clinic in a town sixty miles from Baghdad which Iraqi officials said had been hit by allied bombing 

Nick Gowing reporting 

France 's senior military officer General Maurice Schmidt confirmed in Paris today that the allies have detected weak traces of chemical fallout on the Saudi border with Kuwait and in the Gulf

The French believe it 's been caused by allied attacks on Iraq 's chemical weapons facilities

Although the General did not identify the chemical traces he did say that they posed no threat to allied troops or the civilian population

American commanders say their attacks on chemical and biological facilities have been carefully targeted to avoid putting the civilian population in danger

Our science correspondent Andrew Veich has been assessing the risk 

Allied bombers have flown more than five hundred sorties against nuclear chemical and biological weapons facilities in Iraq 

Today the French chief of staff confirmed that traces of chemicals probably nerve gases released as a result of the bombing had been detected over a wide area  but levels were too low to endanger troops







According to Soviet military officials Iraq has up to four thousand tons of poison gas including the nerve agent surrin and taboon

These chemicals could be absolutely devastating for people who live in the vicinity of the chemical plant because if there is a sufficient tonnage of chemicals in the plant and they have been released then those chemicals are toxic in very small amounts

So I think people in the vicinity of the plant are at great risk and there could 've been many deaths 

Bombers have targeted thirty-one nuclear biological and chemical facilities 

The military claim that all nuclear reactors have been destroyed and that fourteen chemical and biological factories and storage areas have been destroyed or heavily damaged 





According to the allies this supposed baby milk factory in Baghdad was producing biological weapons and Soviet experts say Iraq has stockpiled anthrax and cholera 

The military is not ruling out the possibility of contamination as a result of the bombing





Bhopal central India nineteen eighty-four

More than two thousand died and two hundred thousand were injured when a cloud of methyl isocyanate leaked from the Union Carbide Chemical Plant

The effects of nerve gas would be even worse

Well the nerve agents act basically by blocking the message from the nerves to the muscles so the muscles go into spasm and of course the muscles that control your breathing are in spasm and people asphyxiate and that can happen very quickly 

Experts say that if these plants are being destroyed without endangering civilians it may be because the chemicals and germs they contained have already been moved out either to more secure storage facilities  or to the battle zone

The U S Defence Secretary Dick Cheney speaking to a conference in Washington this afternoon said the war was going well for the allies

But he said they 'd been cautious in their assessments

U S Defence Secretary Dick Cheney

And other developments in the war today

Two U S servicemen and a Saudi security guard were injured in a suspected terrorist attack on a military base i on a military bus in the Saudi Red Sea port of Jeddah 

And in Bahrain the government today appealed for international help to combat the threat posed by the huge oil-slick in the Gulf

Although the slick is breaking up as it heads south Bahrain 's Health Minister said it still threatens catastrophe

He said Bahrain needed help from other countries

Bahrain he said is doing its best to protect its water and desalination plants

But the minister says he still fears the slick due to arrive in five or six days could cause greater damage than the war itself 

Good evening

John Major flew to Germany today for talks with Chancellor Kohl leaving gloomy economic news behind him

Two sets of figures a more than one per cent jump in factory prices and the worst year ever for company bankruptcies

Here the Government attacks British Rail for failing to survive the cold

B R says it 's the wrong type of snow 

And from Israel a special report tonight on how Scud attacks raw nerves and repression in the occupied territories are damaging the Israeli economy 

The Government 's hopes for the economy took a severe battering today

New figures revealed a record number of company insolvencies last year a steep rise in manufacturing prices and the confidence of small businesses at its lowest ebb for more than a decade 

Labour said that the country was sinking further into recession and called for an urgent cut in interest rates 

But more job losses are on the way

Tonight British Airways met its unions and announced that more than four thousand jobs are to be lost because of the drop in air travel

We 'll have a report on that in a moment but first our economics correspondent Paul Neild reports on the deepening gloom over the British economy 

Business is bad

The makers of the Reliant Robin are still in receivership but are hopeful of saving their company 

Others haven't been so lucky

A record number of firms went bust in the final quarter of last year

New official figures show company insolvencies at an all-time high 

Well clearly the problem is very serious and growing more serious and many businesses are frankly unable to cope with the financial pressures on them uh and it 's very sad to see how many are going out of business at present

Uh what 's perhaps encouraging is that the the rate of increase in these figures is a little bit less than the rate of increase was three months ago

So perhaps we 're getting towards the sort of the peak in insolvencies

We 'll have to see 

But a fly in the ointment is inflation

Although the price of raw materials going into factories in January was about two per cent lower than a year ago the price of finished goods leaving factories was up over six per cent a worse figure than the previous month

That 's worrying

On top of that a C B I survey of small businesses said today that the little man is doing even less well than larger enterprises 

This is a small workshop at Foxton near Cambridge specialising in making milling and cutting machines

Set up in eighty-three a product of the factory miracle it expanded to employ thirty-two people just a year ago

Now half have been laid off

What 's gone wrong 

We were very badly affected by companies failing on us

They in turn  were punished by the interest rates which uhm rose rapidly 

What that has meant is that we had to reduce staff  from thirty-two to fourteen

We also have now much higher costs of borrowing 

Despite its cloistered existence Cambridge is really feeling the pinch unprotected from the economic midwinter 

Unemployment here has risen fifty per cent over the past year as white-collar industries such as insurance banking and services have come under the hammer

Tourism is down too 

It 's not confined to manufacturing this time round 

The recession of a decade ago largely passed cities like Cambridge by 

But now even here people are beginning to come to terms with the word unemployment and the signs are it 's going to get a lot worse before it gets any better

Indeed local estimates suggest that Cambridge unemployment will double over the next year

And in a recent survey four out of five local businessmen were citing interest rates as the prime cause of their ills

Businesses are really suffering from high interest rates  uh very high levels of borrowing  which they 're having to service  and they 're still cutting back on their fixed investment and on their stocks 

Business is in a virtual panic at this moment

There 's a genuine crisis of confidence 

Ironically it 's hundreds of miles from Cambridge in Spain that a bar to lower interest rates lies 

This is because the peseta is very strong within the Exchange Rate Mechanism

If only the Spanish would lower their interest rates to weaken the peseta then Mr Lamont would have more leeway to lower Britain 's without the pound falling out of the Mechanism 

Currently within the E R M the lira is the median currency neither strong nor weak against the others 

The peseta is exceptionally strong while the Belgian franc Deutschmark and guilder are all mildly strong 

The punt kroner and French franc are mildly weak while the pound is already the weakest of them all 

A cut in interest rates would undoubtedly mean that we would drop out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism 

I 've heard it suggested that the markets have already discounted a one or two per cent reduction in interest rates 

I 'm afraid I don't buy that 

W w we can only accomplish a cut in intrates rates interest rates however against the background I believe of a geniu a general realignment of European currencies 

But there 's no sign of any such realignment at the moment  which might get industry and interest rates off the E R M hook

Perhaps with the spectre of slump approaching Mr Lamont might be tempted to cut interest rates anyway and hope the pound survives intact

Well British Airways will announce its job losses officially tomorrow but it told its unions tonight that four thousand three hundred jobs would have to go as soon as possible

B A hopes workers aged over fifty will volunteer to make up the numbers but another two thousand workers will have to go on half-pay

The unions say they accept that a twenty per cent drop in passenger traffic justifies the management 's action

The meeting ended just over an hour ago

Our industrial correspondent Ian Ross is at Heathrow has just filed us this report 

British Airways in common with some other airlines has seen a very steep decline in passenger traffic thanks to the combined effects of the Gulf War and recession 

Passenger numbers are twenty per cent down on the same period last year 

Aircraft which are not kept in continuous use  and fly without a reasonable pay-load lose money heavily 

B A has already reacted by withdrawing services in order to reduce capacity by about thirteen per cent 

This evening the unions were told of the impact on jobs

There 're fifty-three thousand employees of British Airways

Of these the company needs to make redundant or lose four thousand six hundred worldwide of whom four thousand three hundred are in the U K

And what we 've agreed is all that reduction shall take place by means of voluntary early retirement or by voluntary severance if the voluntary early retirement doesn't meet all that need

Well a twenty per cent uh drop in traffic in uh one month  and then certain of the uh hi higher yields like Concorde and first class and club at forty-five and forty-eight per cent  I mean that is a massive drop in the  revenue of the company 

And uhm something had to be done and I think all the staff in British Airways recognise that uhm  some cutbacks were inevitable 

In addition to the redundancies B A staff anything up to two thousand at a time will be laid off on half-pay

The Prime Minister met Chancellor Kohl in Germany today to talk about the two issues dominating his government the economy and the Gulf War

John Major said he was optimistic about a satisfactory agreement over European economic and monetary union 

Herr Kohl indicated Germany might give more money towards Allied costs in the Gulf 

Our political editor Eleanor Goodman reports from Bonn on the Prime Minister 's visit there 

Chancellor Kohl wanted this visit to demonstrate the strength of Anglo-German relations  but he 's been stung by accusations that Germany has dragged its feet on the Gulf particularly as they 've come only months after Germany was being criticised for wanting to dominate Europe 

For his part Mr Major was also looking to warm up relations chilled by the Thatcher years 

He 's been embarrassed by some of the more jingoistic criticism of the Germans and wanted to thank Chancellor Kohl for the two hundred and seventy million donation to Britain 's Gulf costs 

Both also wanted to develop a very different kind of relationship to the one between Chancellor Kohl and John Major 's predecessor

Mrs Thatcher apparently thought Chancellor Kohl was boring and he thought she was boorish 

But now Germany seems prepared to give Britain 's new leader a chance

The German press dubbed him honest John today  and both seem confident they could find common ground

We have a lot to discuss   a lot to discuss a lot in common

Top of the agenda the role for Germany in the Gulf crisis given the present constitutional ban on German troops operating outside NATO 

One suggestion that German soldiers should form part of a U N peace-keeping troop though that too would probably require changing the law 

German public opinion originally strongly against the war now supports the Allied action despite the continued efforts of the peace movement

Even so the Germans don't agree with the British on the lessons for Europe of the crisis believing it strengthens rather than weakens the case for political union 

There 're also sharp divergences of interest between Britain and Germany over economic policy

Not only has the Bundesbank 's decision to raise interest rates added to John Major 's domestic political problems

but Germany is still arguing for a single European currency based in effect on the Deutschmark rather than going along with Britain 's ideas for a hard ecu 

But when the two leaders emerged from their meeting they played down their differences

Chancellor Kohl said they had agreed totally on the Gulf

He also promised that Germany wouldn't try to corner Britain over political union 

Rather Germany might have to make a detour to achieve political union

Mr Major thanked Chancellor Helmut as he called him and agreed there might have to be detours but said agreement was possible

And I remain confident that at the end of it we will have an agreement that each member state will be able to present to its domestic parliament and uh and invite them to approve it

I very much hope that that will prove to be the case

Britain and Germany will no doubt continue to disagree on particular policy issues but Chancellor Kohl and John Major clearly feel that the important thing is to have the kind of ongoing relationship which can survive individual policy disagreements 

Mr Major then went on to visit the families of British servicemen serving in the Gulf 

He promised that the troops would be brought home as soon as possible 

And once the crisis is over Britain and Germany now believe they 're more likely to find common ground in the search for a post-war settlement 

Eleanor Goodman I T N Bonn 

The former Chief Secretary to the Treasury John Biffin told us that the Government is inhibited by the Exchange Rate Mechanism from cutting interest rates but that they would come down in the next two or three months

I asked him given the state of the economy whether the Gulf War was standing between the Government and electoral ruin 

Well I 'm sure that 's not the case but uh I I 'm also certain that it 's a very unprofitable exercise uh though a tantalising one for the media to constantly speculate about the date of the next election

I as a working politician am in a Parliament engaged in a session 's legislation

That will effectively be concluded in July

I really can't see any case for having a general election earlier than the autumn when we will have completed our present task

Nevertheless the Gulf crisis is presumably providing quite a handy curtain behind which quite a lot of wrestling must now be going on in your party about what happens next to the economy

Well I think that the Government 's economic policy has been set out in the recent decisions on public expenditure which uh provide for a very substantial increase 

and there is very clear indications that the consequence of that is that there is very little tax manoeuvre uh for the Chancellor come the budget

I suppose the matter of natural interest is how soon we can bring down interest rates 

and the Chancellor has suggested that uh this can take place

but it must be preceded by a substantial fall in the rate of inflation

Poll shows all three Tory leadership challengers will beat Labour 

So Conservative MPs consult their constituencies again 

Roald Dahl master of the nasty surprise is dead 

Junior doctors will take action to get a shorter working week 

On the sub that sank the trawler minister orders inquiry 

Good evening

A poll for News at Ten the first since Mrs Thatcher stepped down as Conservative Party leader  shows any of the three candidates fighting to succeed her Mr Heseltine Mr Hurd or Mr Major could lead the Tories to victory at a general election 

The Harris poll shows Mr Heseltine is the most popular with Mr Major second 

More than eleven hundred people in fifty constituencies were asked how they 'd vote with each of the three men leading the Conservatives 

If it was Mr Heseltine forty-nine per cent said they 'd vote Conservative

thirty-nine per cent Labour

a margin of ten per cent 

If it was Mr Major the Conservative vote would be forty-seven per cent

the Labour vote forty per cent

a gap of seven per cent 

If it was Mr Hurd forty-five per cent said they 'd vote Conservative and forty-one per cent would vote Labour

a four per cent lead 

On who would make the best Prime Minister among those stating a preference forty-nine per cent said Mr Heseltine

twenty-seven per cent Mr Major

and twenty-four per cent said Mr Hurd 

And looking back over Mrs Thatcher 's eleven years in power sixty per cent said she 'd been a good Prime Minister thirty-three per cent said that she 'd been a bad one and seven per cent didn't know 

Today Mr Hurd and Mr Major began their campaigns in earnest with parliamentary support swinging Mr Major 's way 

Downing Street packed with the world 's cameras and commentators yesterday showed little sign of Mrs Thatcher 's impending departure today  save for the flowers and gifts which continue to arrive for her

The rough old trade of politics have has moved swiftly on 

First to the Treasury for the opening shots of John Major 's campaign 

An hour later as though this was some general election campaign morning  attention switched to the Foreign Office as Douglas Hurd set out his campaign stall 

Michael Heseltine having been through all that ten days ago went to his campaign office to work on maintaining and increasing his first ballot vote 

So as Tory MPs begin a weekend in which they must try and decide between those three candidates  what are the policy bases from which the candidates start 

John Major is emphasising the proper running of the economy what he calls the crucial issue of education and the Poll Tax where he says things can't be left as they are

He 's begun to put some distance between his ideas and those of the Thatcher Government 

In no sense where necessary and if necessary  would I be afraid to make changes in government policy 

And I believe in the next uh ten years we will have to continue to make changes that will genuinely produce across the whole of this country a genuinely classless society in which people uh can rise to whatever level that their own abilities and their own good fortune may take them from wherever they started 

His campaign team are trying to paint him as less patrician than Douglas Hurd and less flashy than Michael Heseltine 

John Major is of the people

And John Major is capable of reaching out to the people particularly the crucial people that the Conservative Party needs at this time

And he will do it in a straightforward non-flashy totally honest and straightforward way 

Douglas Hurd stressed what he called sound money and social responsibility

He agreed that everyone wanted another look at the Poll Tax and stressed his experience in handling Foreign Affairs

And he too wanted to stress the difference between the Thatcher and Hurd way of doing things

I think  that democratic government consists of listening  deciding  persuading 

You listen to views

You take a decision in our case collectively  in Cabinet  A

and then you persuade  in Parliament  in the country as a whole  that what you 're doing is sensible and right 

Now persuasion is not the same as assertion

And as we move towards a a general election  we need to spend more time on persuasion 

So what would be Douglas Hurd 's special qualities as Prime Minister 

I think he 's got enormous uh leadership qualities

He 's got a real inner steel and toughness

And I think that will come through very strongly when he becomes Prime Minister 

Before leaving his campaign office tonight Michael Heseltine had repeated his commitment to a fundamental review of the Poll Tax and stressed that he wanted to move Thatcherism onto a new and different phase

In the old atmosphere where people have said for four years

well

isn't he a bit apart

Now that 's suddenly breaking down as people are listening to what I am saying and realising that actually I am a radical reforming Tory wanting to push on the frontiers into the nineteen nineties

But to do that and to keep up the momentum of change and to protect all we 've achieved in the eighties we 've got to win 

On Channel Four News tonight Mr Heseltine suggested that as Prime Minister he 'd give Mr Major and Mr Hurd jobs 

John is an excellent Chancellor Douglas a top-class Foreign Secretary 

I think that perhaps I could give them the backing to go out and win the election so that they can go on doing the jobs that they are so obviously  succeeding at

And his supporters say he 'll bring about that win at the general election

It is becoming obvious now that a number of the right of the party see that uh see him as the leader see him as therefore a unifying force and also and perhaps paramount at this stage the man that can win us the next general election 

For what it 's worth the feeling in and around Westminster tonight is that Mr Heseltine has held on to his a hundred and fifty-two votes and may even have built on that a bit

but John Major has come up very fast to get close to him even perhaps alongside him

and that at the moment it 's Douglas Hurd who 's trailing a little 

Michael Brunson News at Ten

Westminster 

A week ago Conservative MPs were getting the views of their local parties on whether or not to support Mrs Thatcher

Tonight they 're back in their constituencies doing it all again to try to decide on her successor 

Mrs Thatcher may have got Philip Oppenheim 's support in the first round

but it 's by no means certain he 'd have voted for her in the second 

At midday he began a weekend of soundings among party workers constituents and local business people in Ripley 

Annually over lunch they bend his ear about local concerns

Today they want to hear his views on the leadership contest 

Word around the sort of corridors in the Commons is that maybe it 's time to skip a generation

They tell him their preferences are for Mr Major and Mr Heseltine

If it 's somebody who 's going to win the next election  unquestionably it should be Michael Heseltine 

If it is somebody who is going to be in the long term interest of the country in most respects it should almost certainly be John Major

But I think Heseltine 's got what it takes to win the next election and get us out of this mess that we are in

John Major 

I think he is articulate 

Uhm he 's obviously got a grip of economic affairs and really that is a very important factor in uh future government policies

In a show of hands the majority of the three dozen people here voted for Heseltine with Major a close second and Hurd a poor third 

The agents ' personal preference is for John Major

They both agree Mr Hurd is the least favoured candidate

A lot of people see him as being you know a marvellous Foreign Secretary but someone who might be little bit too patrician and someone who probably wouldn't go down too well in what is fundamentally a working class uh industrial Midlands constituency like this one 

whereas John Major is uh you know an ordinary guy

He 's come up through the ranks and he 's well respected 

He consults us on on most things and takes note of what we say

But ultimately at the end of the day it is down to the individual MPs 

But they should really take note of what their constituents want them to do

If so soundings here so far suggest the MP would vote for Mr Heseltine

But it seems likely he 'll choose John Major

It is to be hoped that meets with local approval

The removal lorry has been booked to start moving the Thatchers out of Downing Street and into their new house in Dulwich on Monday

Packing up has already begun 

Mr Thatcher and a chauffeur took four suitcases into Number Ten

Mrs Thatcher stayed indoors sending thank you letters to people who 've sent her flowers 

Those close to Mrs Thatcher are tonight adjusting to the gloomy reality of life after power

A night to begin packing possessions acquired during more than a decade in office

For the occupants a melancholy time 

Even Humphrey the Cabinet cat seems affected by the imminent change of occupier 

Earlier the van entrusted with the task of removing the traces of a decade of Thatcherism from Downing Street was getting a spring clean 

But not often for a Prime Minister

And when Mr Thatcher arrived at the front door today it was in a car containing empty suitcases ready to be filled with some of the many possessions gathered over the years

Of Mrs Thatcher there was no sign 

The waiting cameramen were told by her son that she was sad but not bitter 

As for the intriguing question what does she do next Mrs Thatcher has not apparently given it much thought 

Her daughter Carol having produced coffee for the waiting reporters offered some thoughts on the matter

When I see her I 'm just going to say

welcome to the freelance club because I 'm freelance

and I think  uh it 's the first day of the rest of her life and 

you know I think she 'll get on with it 

Leaders from all round the world telephoned Downing Street with messages of support

The former American president Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy were ready to offer advice on retirement 

The Czechoslav president Vaclav Havel told her she was always welcome in Czechoslovakia 

Canada 's Brian Mulroney and the former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger also sent best wishes 

Her departure is going to cause long faces at Central Office among those producing next year 's diary

for as always the first page carries a picture of the Prime Minister

and tonight that Prime Minister is preparing to pack her bags

Peter Allen News at Ten Downing Street 

The three candidates aren't the only ones thinking about life in Number Ten 

So are their wives 

During the leadership campaign I T N will profile Mr Hurd 's wife Judy and Mr Major 's wife Norma 

First Ann Heseltine talks about her husband Michael and how he 's got where he is the hard way 

Ann Heseltine standing by her husband on the day he announced his intention to fight for the leadership

It was she said a great relief 

Once you 're doing something you 're involved in it and adrenalin flows and there 's lots to do 

It 's much better than sitting around chewing your nails thinking

well

shall I organise this

or shall I arrange to do that 

and then you know will I have to unscramble everything 

You know at least it was a positive decision and one had something to go for

Do you want him to become Prime Minister

Of course I do

I think it would be wonderful 

Yes

I 'd be terribly proud of him

Wouldn't anybody 

The family is Ann Heseltine 's first love but she is also passionate about art

She is currently researching a catalogue on Dutch Masters and running the appeal fund for the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford

Her love of art has had a profound influence on her husband

When I first met Michael I mean he 'd he 'd never really hardly been inside a gallery uhm 

and I was thrilled because he you know he said I 'll come

I 'll come with you

Take me around and tell me about things

So we went to the Tate 

And I just realised he 'd got a very good eye 

Ann Heseltine has a reputation for being down to earth

Married to a multi-millionaire she 's quick to point out it wasn't always that way

It wasn't just an easy ride

And he had bad times and good times and we 've been through most of them together

He 's a fighter

He he doesn't give up easy

I mean you 're never going to succeed anywhere if you 're always sort of bland and easy and so on 

but uhm 

I mean he is a very easy-going man it has to be said

I mean the children can do that with him

The Iraqis have told the Red Cross they 're ready to release allied prisoners of war in exchange for the return of their own captured troops 

Both President Bush and Mr Major have lavished praise on the allied soldiers who won the war 

Mr Bush told American forces

the spectre of Vietnam has been buried in the desert sands 

Four members of a television news crew arrested by the Iraqis six weeks ago have been set free 

The Environment Secretary says he won't be stampeded into ill-considered judgements on the future of the poll tax 

The I R A has admitted murdering a soldier and seriously injuring three others in a mortar attack yesterday 

The day 's rugby internationals were won by England and France who will meet in a fortnight with the Grand Slam at stake 

The International Red Cross says Iraq is now ready to exchange prisoners of war with the allies

Details will be worked out tomorrow when allied and Iraqi military commanders meet to negotiate a formal ceasefire 

The talks which were planned for today were postponed at Iraq 's request 

However Baghdad has now confirmed that they 'll take place in the morning in allied-held territory in Iraq 

The release of P O Ws is one of the conditions laid down by President Bush for a ceasefire 

Throughout the conflict efforts by the Red Cross to be allowed access to prisoners of war in Iraq have met with refusals

Our foreign affairs correspondent Matt Frei reports

A Red Cross spokesman said the Iraqi announcement was very good news because the Iraqi authorities have been describing captured allied soldiers as criminals and not prisoners of war

Today the Iraqi government also mentioned for the first time that it intended to release them although it 's not clear what Baghdad meant by immediately

There are thought to be at least thirty allied P O Ws in Iraqi hands

Another fifty-six allied soldiers have been described as missing in action

Some of them could also be held as prisoners

The Red Cross spokesman added that by referring to the Geneva Convention the Iraqis should now recognise the right of the Red Cross to visit the prisoners  a right which had continually been requested but not granted

A thirteen-man Red Cross team has been in Baghdad for some time waiting to visit the P O Ws 

According to the spokesman a large question mark also hangs over the Iraqi demand for reciprocity

This the spokesman said was not in line with the third Geneva Convention which merely calls on combatants to perform their humanitarian duty to release prisoners of war once hostilities have ceased

It 's also not clear whether the Iraqi government intends to release the thousands of Kuwaiti civilians it 's thought to have captured nor whether it wants the immediate release of all the estimated one hundred and seventy-five thousand Iraqi P O Ws in allied hands  many of whom may now invoke their right under the Geneva Convention not to be repatriated to Iraq

Some of the immense logistic difficulties involved in a release of P O Ws will be discussed tomorrow when Iraqi and allied military commanders meet to thrash out the terms of a permanent ceasefire 

At the American military briefing in Riyadh Brigadier General Richard Neill has emphasised that the repatriation of allied prisoners of war will be the allies ' number one priority 

He warned the Iraqi command against playing for time at tomorrow 's talks





General Neill also gave details of incidents in the battlefield which demonstrated that many Iraqi troops were still unaware that the war is effectively over 

This report from our defence correspondent Mark Laity who 's in Riyadh

The allies believe recent battlefield casualties have shown how vital tomorrow 's meeting between the allies and Iraq is 

In one incident the U S army destroyed several tanks and other armoured vehicles after coming under fire  while in another there were some Iraqi casualties as American soldiers captured over a thousand troops on an Iraqi airfield 

These are amongst many soldiers bypassed during the high-speed allied offensive and others are still being rounded up 

Elsewhere several allied soldiers have died in minefields 

Preventing these incidents will be a main theme of the meeting with the allies demanding information on the position of minefields

and to arrange a demarcation line between Iraqi and coalition forces

General Neill suggested the Iraqis will also have to play a part in telling their forces in allied-controlled territory that a ceasefire is in effect 

The allies will also want an agreement on the exchange of prisoners of war with an early release of captured service personnel and civilian detainees 

It 's clear the coalition is not in a mood to negotiate over its demands with the main issues expected to be resolved tomorrow

And General Neill implied the Iraqis have already received details of what the coalition wants 

The Defence Secretary Mr Tom King has also been speaking about the latest skirmishes on the battlefield

Talking to reporters in Glasgow  he said that fighting had erupted this morning when encircled Iraqi troops had tried to escape towards Basra

I understand there 've been a number of tanks  armoured personnel carriers uh and indeed some Frog uh missile launchers  destroyed and a considerable number of uh prisoners of war taken as well uh

And I think this was one of the uh it sounds to me and I don't have confirmation of this It sounds to me like a part of a Republican Guard unit  that may have been within the encirclement still had some fighting capability and were trying to uh slip away uh out of the uh uh encirclement and uh that 's been contained uh and that it 's been defeated

The Defence Secretary Mr Tom King 

President Bush has praised the role of American troops in liberating Kuwait

In a radio message broadcast to United States forces  Mr Bush said one of Saddam Hussein 's biggest mistakes had been to underestimate the determination of the American people and the daring of their troops

The day of the dictator was over

Kuwait 's night of terror had ended 

The success of the operation he said had expunged the psychological scars left by Vietnam













Mr Bush said the sacrifice of those who had given their lives would never be forgotten

The first test of the new world order had been passed

Now the hard work of freedom awaited 

These sentiments have been echoed by the Prime Minister Mr Major 

He told representatives at the lo Conservative local government conference in London that the loss of those who gave their lives had touched the whole country

Our hearts go out with very great sorrow to all their families and to all their friends 

I would simply say to them 

we won't forget those young men 

and nor in my judgement will we forget what they were out there to achieve  what they accomplished 

They were there to accomplish peace  and security  and they did it magnificently

The Prime Minister said they and their colleagues in the allied forces had won the war

It was now the duty of the politicians to work for a peace which was worthy of that achievement and to bring the troops home to their families as soon as possible 

British and American engineers are taking part in a major operation to remove wreckage from the main highway north of Kuwait City  the scene of allied bombing on Tuesday in which hundreds of fleeing troops were killed 

The convoy was also caught in crossfire between coalition and Iraqi forces

Two vehicles with Red Crescent markings were among those destroyed 

As our correspondent Stephen Sackur reports  bodies are still being recovered  and it 's expected to be several days before the road is cleared

Squadrons of Royal Engineers from the British First Armoured Division are now involved in a potentially dangerous operation to clear the Basra highway

In amongst the hundreds of civilian vehicles tanks and trucks lying wrecked on the road are many tons of live ammunition 

Repeatedly this morning the engineers ' armoured bulldozers were prevented from beginning their task  because of concern about their safety 

They 've had to breach an Iraqi-laid minefield to reach the far end of the convoy and at one point a stricken Iraqi T fifty-five tank caught fire 

The troops were forced to evacuate the area 

With teams of American soldiers still combing the wreckage for bodies  the highway is likely to remain blocked for many days probably weeks 

Though it 's now four days since the American attack on thousands of fleeing Iraqi troops  there are still scores of charred bodies lying on the side of the road

Another of our correspondents Tom Carver has also been to the scene of the convoy attack  and was then able to travel further north along the road towards Iraq

He sent this report

A one-mile stretch of the highway has been turned into a landing strip 

This 'll be used to fly in supplies and fly some of the troops out 

A few hundred yards into the desert I counted twenty-four destroyed oil well-heads burning fiercely in the strong westerly wind

One American colonel who had driven through the field said that every single well-head had been destroyed but not all of them were alight 

These are spewing out oil into the desert creating great black lakes 

Further north I came across dozens of Iraqi soldiers wandering slowly towards their border

They looked tired and hungry and some had no shoes on 

They walked past several allied soldiers who seemed to take no notice of them 

Making their way south in the opposite direction are groups of Kuwaitis and Egyptians who had been transported to Basra by the Iraqis 

As these groups passed each other some of them waved  both sides reduced to a common fate by this short but brutal war

A senior member of the Kuwaiti government has said that more than thirty thousand Kuwaitis have disappeared since the beginning of the Iraqi occupation 

The Minister for Cabinet Affairs Dr Abdul al Awadi said more than eight thousand of them had vanished in the past ten days 

However he pledged that those suspected of collaborating with the Iraqi regime would be given a fair trial 

The Iraqi authorities have freed a television crew who worked for the American C B S network 

The four men were detained nearly six weeks ago 

Bob Simpson who 's in Baghdad has sent us this report under Iraqi supervision

The crew multi-national though working for an American television network disappeared a month ago

Their car was found in the desert keys still in the ignition 

But extensive searches failed to locate them

simply their tracks heading towards Iraqi-held territory 

Sometime later there was news that they were being held by the Iraqis but no more 

Then in the early hours of this morning  the four were delivered to the Al Rashid hotel in Baghdad home to the journalists here 

Their colleagues kept their presence secret as final negotiations took place

Then at lunchtime they were officially released 

A government statement was read out saying the crew 's release followed the intervention of the Soviet government and a personal message from  who 'd previously been involved in contacts between the Soviet Union and Iraq 

The statement added that the crew including the C B S London bureau chief for Britain Peter Bluff and the American correspondent Bob Simon had crossed illegally into Iraqi territory 

The four are now on their way by road to Jordan

As they left Bob Simon spoke haltingly about their ordeal









Bob Simon one of four American television journalists released from detention by the Iraqi authorities 

There 's been another peace demonstration in central London organised by the Committee to Stop the War in the Gulf 

This time the campaigners were calling for what they described as a just peace 

The organisers say two thousand people took part

The police put the figure at fifteen hundred

With the fighting over the campaigners are now focusing on how a lasting peace is to be achieved in the Middle East 

They also articulated their anger at the nature of the allied victory and the scale of the Iraqi casualties

Some sections of the crowd denounced President Bush John Major and Neil Kinnock as killers

Later at a rally in Trafalgar Square one of the speakers the Labour M P Ken Livingstone condemned what he described as western barbarism

The campaigners want a regional conference to be set up to discuss the future of the Middle East 

They say it 's essential that subjects like the Palestinian issue are on the agenda

At a similar rally in Glasgow the Labour M P Mr George Galloway said British forces should now be used to protect Palestinians in Kuwait from possible revenge attacks 

He said there was a real danger of massacres in the absence of civil authority

American B Fifty-Two bombers have left their base in Gloucestershire laden with five hundred pound bombs 

British troops in the Gulf have completed the movement of large quantities of fuel and ammunition in preparation for a land offensive 

The Americans say that more than two thousand Iraqi tanks personnel carriers and artillery pieces have now been destroyed 

The Prime Minister has said the outcome of the war is in no doubt

only the timing is uncertain 

Freezing fog has added to the problems caused by snow and ice 

In one of the few sporting fixtures to survive Liverpool return to the top of the First Division with a three one win over Everton 

Five American B Fifty-Two bombers have taken off from a base in Gloucestershire possibly on the first bombing raid of the Gulf War to be launched from Britain

The B Fifty-Twos arrived at R A F Fairford earlier this week after the British government had agreed to an American request to use the base for sorties against Iraq and occupied Kuwait 

This afternoon officials refused to say whether the bombers were on a war mission although staff at the base were seen loading five hundred pound bombs onto the planes

From RAF Fairford our Midlands correspondent Bob Sinkinson reports

The huge B Fifty-Twos arrived at Fairford last Tuesday

Eight of them have remained parked at the side of the runway all week

Maintenance crews have worked on them every day but this morning they began loading bombs and sweeping snow off the planes ' wings and fuselage

I watched some of the armaments being fixed to the aircrafts ' wings

As they were being attached air crew could be seen writing messages on them

Then shortly after lunchtime the engines of five of the aircraft were fired up and it wasn't long before the bombers were thundering down the runway 

The first four took off at one minute intervals the fifth a little later

They threw up plumes of powdered snow as they sped down the runway

Then as they banked to the right they were quickly lost in the gloom of a winter 's afternoon

Security at the airbase appears to have been tightened considerably in the past twenty-four hours with increased military patrols around the base 's perimeter fence

British forces in Saudi Arabia have been moving vast quantities of fuel and ammunition in preparation for an Allied ground offensive

Details of the operation were given at the British military briefing in Riyadh by Group Captain Niall Irving

In preparation for land operations the army has completed its most complex logistic operation ever

A vast logistic base has been established and stocked in the operational area

Over forty thousand tons of ammunition and three and a half million gallons of fuel have been moved so far 

The petrol is enough to take an average family car one hundred million miles or four thousand times round the world

Group Captain Irving  said the R A F had now mounted more than two thousand eight hundred air sorties

Among their most recent targets had been Iraqi storage tanks surface to air missiles and two bridges one of which had been destroyed and the other badly damaged

Allied attacks on bridges were he said having a devastating effect on Iraq 's ability to supply its forces 

Group Captain Irving said the Royal Navy destroyers H M S Manchester and Exeter and the frigates H M S Brilliant and Brave had joined the British naval forces in the Gulf 

At the American military briefing General Richard Neill said that around twenty per cent of Iraq 's military hardware in and around Kuwait had been destroyed

Giving what he described as confirmed figures he said more than seven hundred and fifty tanks six hundred and fifty artillery pieces and six hundred armoured personnel carriers had been put out of action

General Neill said no further Iraqi aircraft had fled to Iran

The figure remained at a hundred and forty-seven

But he was able to give details of the tactics being adopted by Iraqi pilots in their attempt to reach Iran

The two men who 'll advise President Bush on the timing of an Allied ground offensive have been meeting American military commanders in Saudi Arabia 

The U S Defence Secretary Mr Dick Cheney and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell have had what are described as upbeat talks with General Norman Schwarzkopf and his commanders in the field

With his assessment of this and the day 's other events here 's our defence correspondent Mark Laity

Mr Cheney and General Powell have spent the day receiving assessments of the campaign so far from General Schwarzkopf the commanders of the air and naval forces and a variety of other officers

The British commander Lieutenant General Sir Peter De La Billi&egrave;re General Sir Peter De La Billire also met them to discuss the British contribution

The general picture they received was described as upbeat and confident although the figures released today also show the scale of the task remaining

The seven hundred and fifty tanks six hundred and fifty artillery pieces and six hundred armoured personnel carriers amount to less than twenty per cent of the total numbers in the Kuwait theatre and the Allies will want to destroy far more before starting a ground offensive

Nevertheless the figures are not regarded as unsatisfactory because Allied air power has only recently made such targets a high priority

Military sources are also suggesting a high proportion of the destroyed vehicles are from the elite Republican Guard and therefore valued far more highly than those of lesser units

It 's also being emphasised that these figures are confirmed with many other vehicles at least damaged

The Americans seem to be aiming at reducing the effectiveness of the Iraqis by about a half

But this doesn't mean half the equipment must be destroyed because a range of other factors such as supplies and morale also affect fighting capability 

The morale of units in southern Kuwait is believed to be particularly low where the Saudi spokesmen were reporting that an Iraqi Lieutenant Colonel was among several officers who crossed into Saudi Arabia today

Such prisoners have said they 're suffering from severe food shortages much of the credit for which is being given to the Allied campaign to isolate the Kuwaiti theatre

As part of this effort sixty-five bridges have been targeted with forty-two attacked already and at least half destroyed

They include one hit today by RAF aircraft in raids that also damaged another as well as a petrol dump and Republican Guard artillery positions and command posts 

President Gorbachev has warned the Allies that they 're in danger of exceeding their legal powers to oust Iraqi troops from Kuwait

The Soviet leader said the military operations were endangering the spirit of the U N resolutions which authorised the use of force against Iraq 

In a statement carried by the official news agency Tass he made a public appeal to President Saddam Hussein to reconsider his position

The statement also said that he would be sending a personal envoy to Baghdad for a meeting with the Iraqi leader 

The Iraqis in a military communique broadcast within the past hour said that Allied forces had carried out three hundred and forty-five air raids over the previous twenty-four hours

Iraq had launched a Scud missile attack on Tel Aviv and had also carried out missile attacks on Allied positions in Saudi Arabia

Our correspondent Alan Little is in Baghdad

He sent this report on the mood in the Iraqi capital

In Baghdad city centre there 's visible evidence of the precision of the early bombing raids targets in densely built up areas picked out and destroyed

The front wall of the impressive local government ministry has collapsed into the street its frame jutting out at an angle like the ribcage of a decaying carcass

Rubble has spilled on to the road

A few yards away the compound of the British Embassy is unscathed

The main post office is a burnt-out shell its telecommunication tower a twisted heap

Next door a branch of the Rassidian Bank is still trading 

But local people say the bombing changed in the third week of the war

New targets were attacked bridges roads buildings and residential areas

Al Jamoria bridge is down in two places and impassible

but there remain five bridges across the Tigris in the downtown area alone all intact

People here expect further city centre raids aimed at them with inevitable civilian casualties

Earlier this week an apparent attempt to hit Al Adamir bridge failed

Nearby houses were hit

A kerosene heater in one of them caused a fire

One eyewitness I spoke to said six people had died 

Baghdad has been quiet for two nights now

Three air raid alerts last night but no new damage

Many of those who left the city early in the war are beginning to return

The shops are closed but the souks are thriving

Food is available but not fuel to cook it with

Everyone expects the ground war to begin any day

The official media here are preparing public opinion

A front page editorial in Al Khadasir says Iraq will crush its enemies and inflict unprecedented catastrophe on them

It hints that President Saddam Hussein will determine when the conflict will begin and seize control over the course of the war

After twenty-three days of bombardment a kind of routine has descended on Baghdad

Anxiety has given way to making do with no electricity limited water and rapidly diminishing fuel

There 's little enthusiasm for war but no vocal opposition either

Baghdad has dug itself in to wait 

Iran 's top policy-making body has begun discussing Iraq 's response to the Gulf peace initiative being suggested by Teheran

President Rafsanjani and his nat and his Supreme National Security Council were given a message from Saddam Hussein by Iraq 's deputy prime minister Mr Sadoum Hamadi who 's now returned to Iraq

Few details of the Iranian initiative have emerged

But Iran has emphasised that Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait unconditionally

The initiative has been seen as the first credible attempt to find a peaceful solution since the war started 

The Israeli prime minister Mr Yitzak Shamir has played down the significance of the latest Iraqi Scud missile attack on his country

Twenty-six people were injured and a hundred and fifty homes damaged by the first Scud to be fired at Israel for six days

Speaking on Israeli radio Mr Shamir said the danger of Iraqi attacks was waning

Raids on Baghdad 's forces by the Allies would he said end the murderous terrorist attacks from Iraq 

Allied military sources in Saudi Arabia said an Iraqi mobile Scud launcher was destroyed overnight but not the one which was used in the attack on Israel 

The Foreign Secretary Mr Douglas Hurd has arrived in Saudi Arabia where he 's having talks with the exiled Emir of Kuwait and Saudi officials

Earlier after discussions in Cairo with President Mubarak he said Britain and Egypt were in agreement that there should not be any widening of the war aims beyond liberating Kuwait

Britain was not seeking to change Iraq 's boundaries or overthrow President Saddam Hussein

Mr Hurd repeated his view that the post-war peace settlement could not be imposed on the region from Washington or London

it had to come from Arab leaders 

The American authorities have discounted terrorist involvement in an attempt to blow up storage tanks near the United States naval base in Norfolk Virginia

Four people have been arrested near the base and charged with plotting to destroy the chemical storage facility with the intention of collecting the insurance money

The discovery last week of six crude pipe bombs attached to the tanks had prompted fears of a terrorist attack 

The Prime Minister Mr John Major has expressed his absolute confidence that Iraq will be defeated in the Gulf War

He was speaking at the annual conference of the Young Conservatives in Scarborough 

Mr Major said he had no doubt that the British forces were equal to the task now facing them and he promised to give them all the support they required

In a wide ranging speech he also discussed the difficulties facing the economy the need for better services and higher standards in education and Britain 's role in Europe

From the conference here 's our chief political correspondent John Harrison

The Prime Minister applauded the courage of British forces in the Gulf

We didn't want this war but we have it  and we face a difficult period ahead

But Saddam Hussein must know what he faces

He faces defeat

The timing may be uncertain but the outcome is absolutely certain

He faces defeat 

On the economy Mr Major was adamant

High interest rates were necessary however painful and unpopular to beat inflation

The next few months will be uncomfortable

I regret that

But short term expedients won't do

They will only lengthen and worsen the problems themselves 

We must follow a policy that will cure those problems a policy that will cure them and not simply mask them

The Prime Minister said the new Conservative agenda would involve greater support for and demands on public services

For far too long we 've tolerated public services that are just not good enough council house repairs that are shoddy and slow hospital appointments that take all day trains that run late and buses that travel in packs 

Mr Major who flies to Bonn on Monday said Britain was strongly committed to the European Community

But he warned industry that there would be no hiding place for the inefficient in a competitive market

Britain he said could compete and win

It 's eight o'clock on Wednesday the seventh of November

The American mid-term elections have brought little change in Congress but the Republican Party of President Bush has lost two key ton contests for state governors

Mr Edward Heath has said Iraq may let more than fifty British people leave the country next week

There 's been a rowdy start in the Indian parliament to the debate which could bring the downfall of Mr V P Singh 's government

And President Gorbachev has been speaking at this morning 's celebrations in Moscow on the anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution

Today 's newsreader Lawrie Macmillan 

In the American mid-term elections the Democrats have retained control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives and President Bush 's Republicans have made a net loss of three in contests for state governorships 

With results still coming in only one Senate seat looks like changing hands and fewer than eleven Democratic gains are expected in the Lower House

However the defeat of Republican candidates for governor in two key Southern states where Mr Bush had campaigned personally may have laid the groundwork for further Democratic gains in the future

Here 's our Washington correspondent David MacNeill

The Democrats have gained a handful of additional seats in the House of Representatives where they already hold a big majority

There 's been very little change in the Senate where the Democrats appear to have increased their majority by one seat

So on paper it hasn't been a bad night for President Bush

After all the party that controls the White House invariably loses ground in the mid-term elections for Congress and usually much more ground than has been lost this year

However there are worrying signs for the Republicans in the contests for state governors

Because of the shift in population to the warmer parts of the country states like Florida Texas and California are to be given extra seats in Congress

The governors of those states will have a big say in redrawing the boundaries

And it 's here that the Democrats have made significant headway

They have won the elections for governor in both Florida and Texas from the Republicans although Mr Bush 's party appears to have held on to the biggest prize of all California

So while this mid-term election has not been a disaster for the Republicans it does spell trouble for them further down the road

and it 's given new heart to the Democrats as they ponder their chances of ousting the President from the White House two years from now

At the same time neither party can afford to ignore the two main messages from the electorate

One there is widespread dissatisfaction with politics and politicians

and two woe betide the incumbent who raises taxes or the candidate who refuses to rule out the possibility of raising them 

The European Agriculture Commissioner Mr Ray McSharry has given an undertaking that no farmer will be driven out of business by the Community 's agreement last night to cut subsidies by thirty per cent over ten years 

The formula includes income assistance for farmers damaged by loss of financial support and quotas to limit cheap imports

However the Community may have to concede further subsidy cuts during next month 's world trade negotiations in Geneva 

The former Prime Minister Mr Edward Heath has said more than fifty British hostages could be freed by Iraq next week

Mr Heath whose visit to Iraq last month resulted in the release of more than thirty hostages said the group included construction workers who 'd been helping to build President Saddam Hussein 's palace and a number of people who were unwell

But he stressed that although he was optimistic about the release he had received no confirmation from Baghdad

Yesterday the Iraqi authorities announced the freeing of about thirty European hostages and seventy-seven Japanese being held in Iraq and Kuwait 

Mrs Thatcher has told her ministers that the highest priority for the Government is to get the economy right and warned them that they 'll have to work hard in the months ahead 

She was speaking at a Downing Street reception ahead of the new session of Parliament which starts with the Queen 's speech today

In a subsequent debate Mrs Thatcher will address the Commons for the first time since the resignation of Sir Geoffrey Howe and the criticism of her leadership by Mr Michael Heseltine

As our political correspondent Martin Dowell reports M Ps will be listening carefully for any sign of a softening in the Prime Minister 's tone

Mrs Thatcher has been adopting an outward stance of business as usual

She told her ministers at a Downing Street reception last night to work harder and argued that the most important thing for the Conservatives was to get the economy right

She didn't even mention Sir Geoffrey Howe 's resignation or Michael Heseltine 's criticisms

But the decision to bring forward the timetable for any leadership contest to November the twentieth indicates that behind the scenes she 's doing everything possible to prevent her opponents from mounting an effective challenge though some Tory M Ps insist a backbencher will be nominated to oppose her even though the process is being speeded up

The very threat of a contest will increase the pressure on Mrs Thatcher this afternoon to soften the tough tone she adopted last week on the issue of European monetary and economic union

The Labour leader Neil Kinnock will argue in his speech that Mrs Thatcher 's not fit to govern and that challenge or no challenge to her leadership it 's impossible for the Tories to paper over the cracks 

A powerful earthquake has struck southern Iran

Teheran radio reports that at least twenty people have been killed in the province of Fars

It says the quake measured six point six on the Richter scale

In June an earthquake in northern Iran killed an estimated fifty thousand people 

The lower house of the Indian parliament has begun debating a motion of confidence in the Prime Minister Mr V P Singh

It 's the culmination of the political crisis that began last month when the right wing Hindu party the B J P withdrew support for Mr Singh amid violent clashes between Hindus and Muslims

Humphrey Hawksley reports from Delhi

V P Singh is expected to lose this vote of confidence

But the speaker allowed him to put his case first

and to a hostile and rowdy house he spoke about the religious violence which has shaken India over the past month

In a reference to the Hindu claim over a mosque in the northern holy town of Iodia he asked whether religious faith could be placed above the constitution and whether India was heading towards becoming a theocratic state

As M Ps pushed through crowds to get to the chamber the Prime Minister 's critics vowed that he would be forced out of office

But that would do little to end India 's present political instability

And although the man who led the split in the ruling Janata Dal Party Chandra Shakir wants to succeed him any government he heads is not likely to last more than a few months 

An investigation into human rights in Burma by Amnesty International says the country has become a state of terror

According to Amnesty thousands of people have been killed in the last two years

and many more have disappeared without trace

The report says people are imprisoned without trial and torture is routinely carried out in nineteen centres 

Today 's celebrations in Moscow of the seventy-third anniversary of the Communist Revolution have been marked by the traditional military parade in Red Square 

President Gorbachev took the opportunity to make a spirited defence of Communist ideals 

Throughout the Soviet Union and in Moscow alternative demonstrations are planned 

In the Ukrainian capital Kiev hundreds of extra police have been drafted in to prevent trouble from the students ' movement there

In Georgia the Soviet army will march behind the garrison walls and a military parade in the Azerbaijani capital Baku has been cancelled 

As our correspondent in Moscow Kevin Connolly reports Revolution Day is likely to provide a test of the growing opposition

Revolution Day has traditionally provided a focus for an annual reaffirmation of Communist values as well as a display of Soviet military might

But with the party 's authority crumbling and the radical leader of Moscow city council calling for a boycott of the festivities it 's become instead a symbol of changing times 

Other leading figures in Moscow 's growing opposition movement have called on the people of the city to join rival demonstrations later in the day

The size of the turn out at those protests which include a memorial service for the victims of Communism will provide an important test for rival factions in the opposition as well as for the Government 

President Gorbachev used his brief speech at the beginning of the parade to make a spirited defence of Communist ideology

And the military display includes the S S Twenty-Five a mobile intercontinental missile not yet included in arms talks with the United States

But while that on the surface provides an air of normality the eyes of the Soviet leadership will be fixed later in the day not only on Red Square but on the four sites throughout the city where their radical rivals will be testing their strength 

Polling begins this morning in the Irish presidential election

Political commentators say the two leading contenders are so close that a firm prediction is impossible

The candidate of the governing Fianna Fail Party Mr Brian Lenihan who was dismissed from the Cabinet last week is being challenged by Mrs Mary Robinson of Labour 

New research by the National Radiological Protection Board suggests that the problem of radon a radioactive gas which can cause cancer is much more widespread in the west of England than had been thought

The board now believes that every home in Devon and Cornwall should be checked

It estimates that sixty thousand houses will need attention to reduce the risks 

The Home Secretary Mr David Waddington is being asked to prevent two Nigerian women from being deported after serving prison sentences for drug smuggling

The women face automatic deportation unless Mr Waddington intervenes

Last month the Nigerian Government passed a law which said anyone convicted abroad of drug trafficking would face additional penalties in Nigeria

The women could be sentenced to a further five years in prison and have their assets confiscated

The time now is ten minutes past eight

Is there going to be a Conservative leadership election

and if so who will be brave enough or foolhardy enough to stand against Mrs Thatcher

Well in the radio car is Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith the M P for Wealdon and Vice Chairman of the Nineteen Twenty-Two Committee

Good morning

Good morning Brian

Now its the election would have to be a week on Tuesday so somebody 's got to pr put themselves forward very quickly

Yes

That 's it

If there 's going to be somebody then I don't know of anybody

You don't think it will be Geoffrey Howe

No

I think he 's ruled himself out in his letter

He said he wanted to serve the Government uh you know support the Government

That was the last paragraph of the letter so I think he 's out

And there 's n certainly no member of the Cabinet

I think they 're particularly staunch in uh in wanting to get on with their jobs

And they believe it can be done and the Party can be united

And Mr Heseltine

Mr Heseltine

Well I heard him last night on the B B C News and for the second time within uh forty-eight hours or so he 's ruled himself out

So there doesn't seem to be anyone I would call a credible heavyweight candidate

They 've all ruled themselves out

So what would be the point of anyone standing if they didn't stand any chance

Well search me

I mean we 've been through the stalking horse before

I mean

with uh great respect to Sir Anthony Myers who c behaved with considerable dignity I think if we had another stalking horse it would look rather ludicrous

wouldn't it

And also the uhm Central Office would not behave with considerable dignity

would it

I mean he would find himself rubbished

I don't know about 

I don't think it 's a question of being rubbished

Obviously uh anyone 's entitled to come forward

And I think he 'll be treated uh at least I hope he would with considerable courtesy

But uh it 's after all there 's no reason

We 've got the proper machinery to hold these sorts of elections

But I think one ought to have regard to the wider interests of the party and so far as I can judge no one wants an election

Well now it 's a strange way to run a party

is it not

I mean any other party if they have an election campaign they assume they really are competing for the leadership and saying you know uh vote for me and I 'll be the next Prime Minister

Well it 's not the way I think we run it

I mean

what we do is have a machinery which is good democratic machinery to ensure that if there is an election uh then the person who is elected uhm does command the support of the overwhelming majority of the parliamentary party

Uhm uh uh but if people don't come forward then we can hardly bl blame  criticise the machinery 

Right in that case why don't you put your best suit on and you and Cranley Onslow and th a third person and go in and say Margaret we 've sen sed sensed the Party 's opinion

We 've come to the conclusion it really is time for you to go 

Well that 's another question altogether

But tha as far as one can judge that 's not the view of the Chairman of the Nineteen Twenty-Two Committee

And I certainly wouldn't go along like that

After all one has consulted a number of people in the Party and all the impression is that people don't want an election

They don't want her to go

So why should I go along and say something which I know to be uh transparently untrue

The World at One

This is James Naughtie with forty minutes of news and comment

The headlines

The Prime Minister has been meeting senior advisers in the wake of Sir Geoffrey Howe 's resignation

The Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has declared that British interests in Europe can be protected without protests over national sovereignty

A senior company chairman tells us that business believes a single currency in the long term would be good for Britain and they 're pleased that in his speech to the C B I this morning Mr Hurd has not ruled it out

The government is to review regulations governing satellite broadcasting in the light of the Sky Television B S B merger

The Indian government seems certain to fall as the split in the ruling party deepens

And later in the programme as world leaders gather in Geneva to tackle the threat of global warming we 'll be asking whether domestic political pressures will stop them from taking the necessary action

The news is read by Alison Roper

The Prime Minister has spent the first morning of what could prove to be a crucial week for her leadership in consultations with senior colleagues at Downing Street following the resignation of Sir Geoffrey Howe

Mrs Thatcher faces speculation about a leadership challenge following Mr Michael Heseltine 's criticism of her handling of the European issue 

Europe was the subject of a major speech by the Foreign Secretary Mr Douglas Hurd this morning 

He told the C B I conference in Glasgow that Britain could protect its own interests within the European Community without having to protest about threats to national sovereignty

Here 's our chief political correspondent John Harrison 

Douglas Hurd a quiet man by nature a diplomat by training couldn't resist pointing out on Guy Fawkes Day that he 'd had enough of the explosions of the past few days

He was determined to calm Conservative nerves and reassure fellow Europeans that Britain wasn't looking for trouble at next month 's Rome summit

Mrs Thatcher has offended European enthusiasts like Sir Geoffrey Howe and Michael Heseltine by insisting that British sovereignty needed to be protected against ideas like a single European currency

Quite conspicuously Mr Hurd pointed out that sovereignty had already been pooled by Community member states

We have to continue to fight our corner for British interests

We do that

It is right to do that

It requires combat 

But we can do that without frightening ourselves with ogres

Mr Hurd refused to dismiss the idea of a single currency

He said one might evolve but it could not be imposed but a significant number of Tory M Ps believe Mrs Thatcher is determined to obstruct moves towards such a currency on principle

The former Chancellor Nigel Lawson made clear on the Today programme this morning that he too was opposed to a single currency but as with Mr Hurd he was anxious that arguments within the Community should not leave Britain isolated

It is partly about how we play this

And it 's very important of course that uh this is handled in a way that it is not going to uh isolate Britain unnecessarily

The task for Mrs Thatcher now is to reinforce her own authority establish an agreed strategy on Europe and brace herself for a difficult time in the Commons not least if the Tories suffer a significant setback in by-elections on Thursday 

The president of the C B I Sir Brian Corby in his conference speech said that inflation had to be exorcised from society

But in what 's been seen as a reference to high interest rates he said government measures to tackle inflation could leave industry at a disadvantage in future 

European Community agriculture and trade ministers are meeting within the hour in Brussels in another attempt to break the deadlock over cutting farm subsidies

Seven rounds of talks have already failed to produce an agreement mainly because of France and Germany 's refusal to accept a proposal from the European Commission for cuts of thirty per cent

If an agreement is not reached talks on fairer competition and world trade could collapse 

The Independent Broadcasting Authority and the Office of Fair Trading are to investigate the merger between the two satellite television companies Sky and British Satellite Broadcasting

The Arts Minister Mr David Mellor has said the Government would have to reconsider the regulations governing satellite broadcasting in the light of the merger

Speaking at a broadcasting conference in London this morning he also said that even if the new company were to transmit only from a European satellite it would always have to work within a regulatory framework

Here 's our media correspondent Torin Douglas

Mr Mellor who as Broadcasting Minister piloted the new Broadcasting Act through Parliament said the main lesson of the weekend 's events was that in the new more competitive environment commercial television had to be commercial to succeed

He said he hoped satellite television would now be successful but if it were not possible for the new company to continue on B S B satellite it would not escape regulation

Whether it will be suc successful will depend on commercial factors

But there will always have to be a regulatory framework uh around satellite television and the precise form of that regulatory framework is of course that which now has to be reconsidered in the light of these recent developments

The I B A 's Director of Television Mr David Glencross told the same conference the I B A would be holding an urgent meeting with B S B

But first he 'd had to find out who claimed to be speaking on behalf of the company

its executives or the shareholders

It 's one thing for the shareholders of B S B to conclude as they appear to have done that they can no longer support the losses that are being incurred 

It 's quite another for them to imagine that they can transfer or share the contract with whoever they choose

Mr Rupert Murdoch who will own fifty per cent of the merged company is unlikely to be considered an acceptable partner for B S B because of his newspaper interests and his non-European citizenship

The group which has split the governing Janata Dal Party in India has been pressing its bid to take power from Prime Minister V P Singh

The leader of the rebels Mr Chandra Sheka is now attempting to form a government with the support of the Congress Party led by the former Prime Minister Mr Rajiv Gandhi

From Delhi here 's our correspondent Mark Tully

The governing Janata Dal Party split this morning when one group of M Ps reaffirmed their confidence in the Prime Minister Mr Visulav Patal Singh and another elected his arch rival Mr Chandra Sheka as their leader

Mr Chandra Sheka has said he will now hold talks with Rajiv Gandhi 's Congress Party

He appears to have already achieved his two immediate ambitions

To bring down Mr V P Singh the man responsible for his humiliating electoral defeat eleven months ago and to split the Janata Dal

But it will be difficult for Rajiv Gandhi to decide how to take advantage of this

If he supports Mr Chandra Sheka he will be accused of running away from responsibility by not trying to form a government himself

If he forms what would be an unstable government he would probably be unable to stem the current violence in the country or curb inflation fuelled by the Gulf crisis

The former Environment Minister Mr Patrick Nichols has been banned from driving for a year and fined two hundred and fifty pounds

He pleaded guilty to driving with excess alcohol in his blood during last month 's Conservative Party conference 

Cricket

England have salvaged an unlikely draw in their match against Western Australia in Perth

England began their second innings needing three hundred and seventy-three runs to win and rapidly collapsed to ninety for six

But an unbeaten ninety-eight from Robin Smith enabled England to finish on two hundred and twenty-two for nine

The Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd spoke to the C B I conference in Glasgow this morning about Europe

And he tried to smooth over the differences in the Government which had been the subject of so much speculation in recent days and which led to the resignation of the Deputy Prime Minister last week

He said the Government was committed to progress but it had to be measured and step by step

But he also made clear that he saw the hard ecu plan being pushed by Britain as a possible common currency that could in time become a single currency

Our approach concentrates on practical steps designed to promote economic convergence and allows all member states to participate

Setting up a European monetary fund setting up a common currency the hard ecu is we believe the best way of making early progress

In time  if peoples and governments were so to choose a common currency could evolve towards a single currency

But if that happens it would be the result of choice not of imposition

While having made the distinction between an imposed solution and one that evolved among the members of the Community Mr Hurd stressed that he still saw a growing British role in Europe as a vital national interest

We have to make a success of Britain in Europe

I 'm quite clear that our younger generation requires this

I 'm clear from what you and many others have said that the best of our business community require it

And some of us have spent too long on this cause to let it founder

Douglas Hurd

Well just after his speech in Glasgow I spoke to one of the senior businessmen in the audience David Lees who 's the chairman of G K N which does enormous business in Europe of course

I asked him how he interpreted Mr Hurd 's remark about economic and monetary union

The big problem is how do you get from the wide band to the narrow band

Well that 's relatively easy when once inflation converges but the bigger issue is where do you go from there in in phase two

A and certainly our view is that the hard ecu proposals of the Chancellor are extremely helpful in that direction

But you see the Prime Minister said and presumably this is one of the areas of confusion which led to Sir Geoffrey 's resignation the Prime Minister said last Tuesday that she thought for example that as far as individuals were concerned even a successful hard ecu would be something that very few people wanted to use 

Well that is a point of view but it isn't necessarily a business point of view

We see the hard ecu as being extremely useful in the fight against inflation 

We think it would strengthen economic convergence and it would get business used to the use of a common currency during a trial period

So you as businessmen I mean if I can lump you all together rather crudely do want to get to a situation where you 're using the same money to put it bluntly

and having heard Mr Hurd this morning you 're confident that that is the direction he believes we should be going in as well

Well I think we 've got to distinguish between a common currency and a single currency

It 's certainly my own personal view that the move to the hard ecu gets us to the common currency stage and it is possible thereafter to contemplate a single currency which I think has great attractions as an end objective

Do you think that that would be an almost inevitable development

If the hard ecu plan for example were accepted if it developed in the way that John Major and Douglas Hurd say it would develop businessmen began to use it and so on do you think that from there to the single currency would be an easy step and one  which people in this country would want to make by choice

I think it is the ultimate step

I think we 're talking about a step that may not come into play for a a a great many years yet and I think there are a number of examinations economic examinations to be passed first

Do you think that the Government is united enough on this question 

I think the broad principles that government is united on the broad principles

Quite clearly there are different points of view

There 're some wh wh for example on the issue of the single currency wh who feel very strongly that that should not take place

There are others who feel that that it should

At the end of the day that will be a a matter for government a a and no doubt the voting public at large

But I must stress that I I see the single currency as an end objective and a long way away

David Lees of G K N

And in our studio now at the C B I conference in Glasgow is our economics editor Dominic Harrod

Dominic you heard what David Lees said there

He said that business sees the single currency as an objective but a long way away

Having listened to the Foreign Secretary do you think that 's his view too 

I think he is a little bit more cautious perhaps

And I think that one of the reasons why he is cautious is because he is not quite sure how the single currency uh would suit and would sit particularly with the political decisions

I think we still hear an echo in the sorts of things that the Foreign Secretary said of the Prime Minister 's original position at the Madrid summit now what eighteen months or so ago uh where there 's a little bit of worry about if you have a single currency who runs it

That I think is one of the things that they 'll be talking about at these famous intergovernmental conferences beginning around Christmas time

And I think that 's the kind of area where there is uncertainty

But certainly what we 've experienced in the last twenty-four hours or so at the C B I conference in Glasgow has been uh uh moving very much much faster than I 'd expected and I think than others did to the view expressed by industry that a single currency should happen and and there isn't in certainly in the business circles there is not the feeling except among a few uh that it that it should not happen

The question of course is how soon can you get there

The World at One

This is James Naughtie on the day that war began in the Gulf

We 'll have the latest news from the theatre of war where British forces and their allies are now engaged in battle with Iraq in Operation Desert Storm intended to drive the army of Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait

The headlines

The first allied casualties have been reported from the Gulf

Two aircraft involved in the initial strikes against Iraq one British one American are reported to have been lost

The Iraqis claim to have shot down fourteen aircraft

A Saudi oil refinery near the border with Iraq has come under artillery fire

President Bush says the Gulf War is going well and the Prime Minister John Major says he hopes the opening bombardment has convinced President Saddam Hussein that it 's a war he cannot win

The Iraqi leader has broadcast a defiant message on Baghdad radio calling on all Arabs to join the conflict

The news is read by Charlotte Green

With the conflict in the Gulf now more than twelve hours old President Bush has said things are going well and commanders in the area have expressed satisfaction about the conduct of the operation so far

But there have been losses with two planes one British one American shot down in the raids earlier today on Iraqi targets 

Within the past hour the Defence Secretary Mr Tom King has confirmed the loss of an R A F Tornado

In the initial sorties  all our aircraft have returned safely 

But I have to  advise you that during a later sortie  one Tornado suffered an engine fire  and it and its crew are missing 

The Iraqis on the other hand claim to have shot down fourteen allied aircraft over Baghdad and Basra

President Saddam Hussein has maintained his defiant stance denouncing President Bush and forecasting an Iraqi victory 

There 's also a report that Iraqi ground troops have been shelling an oil refinery and populated areas just south of the border between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia

The Americans were said to be mounting a counter-attack 

President Gorbachev has blamed Saddam Hussein for the outbreak of war

He said the hostilities had been provoked by the refusal of the Iraqi leadership to carry out the demands of the world community to pull out of Kuwait 

At home the Prime Minister has been chairing a Cabinet meeting after a night during which he was in constant touch with the White House 

This afternoon he 'll make a statement to the House of Commons

Later he 'll go to Buckingham Palace to bring the Queen up to date on the situation before broadcasting to the nation at nine o'clock tonight 

Our first report is from our defence correspondent Mark Laity who 's in Saudi Arabia monitoring developments

He sent this despatch a short time ago

The allies have been trying to exploit the evident success of their night attack by following up with waves of further air strikes

The allies ' ability to attack powerfully and accurately at night caught the Iraqis at a disadvantage because they lack the same night-fighting capability

and one of the main allied aims was to so weaken the Iraqi air defences that attacks in daylight would not be so risky 

The early evidence suggests the strategy has worked but nevertheless Iraq 's surviving aircraft and huge quantities of guns and missiles will be more effective in daylight

And there are now the first reports of allied casualties albeit small in number

It also looks as if the allies have achieved or are close to achieving total air superiority 

Provided other targets such as ballistic missiles are also dealt with they can then turn their attention to other targets such as the Iraqi army itself trying to weaken it so that it can only offer limited resistance to an allied ground offensive should that be necessary 

The Iraqi military response still seems to be limited although their artillery is said to have been firing at a Saudi oil refinery only to be attacked in turn by U S aircraft and helicopter gunships

There are also reports of a limited amount of air-to-air combat between U S and Iraqi fighters 

British pilots are continuing to carry out bombing missions against Iraqi targets as another of our correspondents in the Gulf Phil Jones reports

Group Captain David Henderson the commander of one detachment of Tornado bombers and Jaguar fighters paid tribute to the outstanding electronic support that his pilots had received in their raids on two Iraqi-held airfields

Armed with a new weapon designed to destroy runways and keep them out of action his Tornadoes began their offensive at two o'clock this morning and it 's still continuing

There had been casualties but he refused to discuss the details saying only that they had been light across the whole multi-national force

He said that the air attack would continue for as long as necessary

His Jaguar fighter formations have still to be used but they 're on immediate standby

According to Group Captain Henderson the effort in the air had been massive and the longer it continued the less likely it was that Saddam Hussein would be capable of retaliating 

It 's been confirmed that one American warplane has been downed in an air battle in the Gulf

The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Senator Sam Nunn told reporters in the last hour that one aircraft had been lost

President Bush is meeting his top advisors at the White House to review the progress of the operation code-named Desert Storm

The President has expressed general optimism about the progress of the war

Here 's our Washington correspondent Jeremy Harris

Mr Bush was up and about long before dawn

During a fleeting visit to the White House briefing room a casually dressed President told correspondents things were still going well with Operation Desert Storm

He said he 'd be meeting Cabinet colleagues including the Secretaries of Defence and State as well as his national security advisor 

Mr Bush is also able to maintain direct contact with the American commander in the Gulf General Schwarzkopf 

Washington has had nothing to say officially about American casualties in the massive aerial bombardment of Iraqi targets a process that could continue for a week or more

However the Pentagon has confirmed the loss of one warplane in combat

The Defence Department have also begun to publicise telephone numbers for families with relatives in the armed forces to contact

And with the outbreak of hostilities the State Department has repeated its warning of possible Iraqi-sponsored terrorist attacks on American targets worldwide 

The Soviet leader Mr Gorbachev has appeared on television to inform the Russian people of the military action against Iraq

He revealed that Washington had informed the Kremlin an hour before the start of the assault

Mr Gorbachev said he 'd relayed the information to the Soviet ambassador in Baghdad and asked him to make a last attempt to persuade Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait

It 's not known whether the message ever reached President Saddam Hussein 

Mr Gorbachev also said he 'd appealed to various countries to keep the conflict localised

His address was broadcast in English on American television 

Mr Gorbachev said the Soviet leadership would do everything to stop the war as soon as possible

But he made it clear he would continue to co-operate with the United Nations 

An American airman flying with the first wave of planes in the attack on Baghdad said there was little response from the Iraqis

Colonel Don Cline of the Twenty-Seventh U S Air Force Tactical Wing attributed much of the apparent success of the operation to efficient intelligence work and preparation







The Iraqis have claimed that fourteen allied planes have been shot down so far

And Baghdad Radio has been broadcasting more defiant words from the Iraqi leader

Our special correspondent in Baghdad Bob Simpson with an air raid siren in the background reports from the Iraqi capital on the latest situation there

After the rigorous and sustained attacks which were driven home here in the early hours of this morning all seems relatively calm now with only the occasional rumble of distant bombing

But there 's an all-pervading dread of what will happen tonight

Details of the damage done by the bombs and missiles last night and this morning is sketchy

The targets were all around Baghdad and many were even over the horizon

There isn't though the massive devastation one might have expected to witness

What damage is obvious appears to be confined to the immediate areas around strategic targets

Some services have been hit

There 's no water or mains electricity in my hotel for example and the telephones all seem to be out of action

There are rumours that an oil refinery and a power station have been hit

Baghdad Radio has reported that nine planes were shot down over the city and another five destroyed as they were attacking Basra

The radio also urged Iraqis to be merciful towards any pilots who were captured

In the past even government ministers have made blood-curdling threats against them

The radio otherwise has broadcast Saddam Hussein in more fervent mood than recently but still defying the forces arranged against him denouncing his attackers as infidels and promising that victory will come for Iraq

That his people believe that after last night is doubtful 

British military sources in Saudi Arabia say Iraqi ground troops have shelled a small oil refinery and tanker depot just south of the Saudi-Kuwaiti border

American forces retaliated

From the Saudi capital Riyadh Jonathan Birchall reports

In what 's the first report of action on the border between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia Iraqi artillery is said to have shelled a small oil refinery and tanker terminal on the Saudi coast

The refinery at Ras al Kapchi is reported to have been slightly damaged

United States aircraft are said to have retaliated with heavily armed A Ten anti-tank planes Cobra helicopters and in close support Harriers of the Marine Corps in action

Ras al Kapchi itself is only a small refinery

A Japanese official here said the only damage was to a single fuel storage tank hit by a shell 

Following the attack on Iraq Saudi Arabia is clearly concerned about the risk of domestic unrest either from some of its own nationals or from Arab or Muslim workers some of whom sympathise with Baghdad

The Interior Ministry has told people to carry on with their work and that attempts to destabilise the country will be severely punished 

British ground forces in the desert have been learning of the allied air raids on Iraq and Kuwait

Our correspondent Joe Paily is with the Seventh Armoured Brigade in Eastern Saudi Arabia

A growling of aircraft in the distance was the only hint during the night that the allied attack had started 

Soldiers of the Seventh Armoured Brigade here in the desert awoke to the news of massive air strikes on Iraqi positions 

The mood was apprehensive but there were positive feelings too as Brigadier Patrick Cordingley explained







British soldiers expect to play a part in the land battle which may lie ahead

For all the allied forces here the long wait is over 

Details of the British involvement in the overnight air attacks have been given during the past hour by the Defence Secretary Mr Tom King

Speaking during a briefing for reporters at the Ministry of Defence in London Mr King spoke of an excellent and encouraging start but he also gave news of the loss of the British Tornado

Our correspondent Roger Hearing reports

Tom King announced the first British losses in the air attacks on Kuwait and Iraq

One Tornado and its crew he said had gone missing following a fire in its engine

It was unclear he said whether the fire had been caused by enemy action or mechanical failure 

But in general the air raids so far had been highly successful

Hundreds of sorties have be already been flown and many more will follow in the hours and days ahead 

We do not yet have any clear full details or analysis of the effects of these first sorties  but the initial impressions indicate that the combined air operations have inflicted significant damage on the targets concerned

The chief of the defence staff and Marshall of the Royal Air Force Sir David Craig said co-operation between the air forces of the five countries involved had worked very well and was a result of careful planning and training

The organisers of Mr John Major 's leadership campaign have claimed he now has the support of more than a hundred and fifty M Ps and is on course for victory

But the figures have been dismissed as bogus and inaccurate by Mr Michael Heseltine 's camp

The three candidates have each won a new influential supporter today

Lord Whitelaw has declared for Mr Hurd the Home Secretary

Mr David Waddington is backing Mr Major

And the Welsh Secretary Mr David Hunt has become the first cabinet minister to support Mr Heseltine

Our political correspondent Robert Orchard assesses the latest campaign developments

This sophisticated leadership campaign intensified this morning with news of extra support for each candidate

Lord Whitelaw the influential Tory elder statesman said Douglas Hurd had great leadership qualities

The Home Secretary David Waddington said he liked the classlessness of John Major

While David Hunt still a Cabinet new boy backed Mr Heseltine as the man with the vigour and energy to win back lost voters

But on T V A M the Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said it would be harder for Mr Heseltine to unite the party after the sadness and indignation over the fall of Mrs Thatcher

And both he and the Chancellor accused Mr Heseltine of being too interventionist in industry of wanting Whitehall to pick winners which wouldn't work

John Major 's team have announced they now have the backing of more than a hundred and fifty Tory M Ps just thirty-seven short of victory on Tuesday

But Mr Heseltine 's campaign manager Sir Neil MacFarlan said these figures were bogus and totally inaccurate

And the Heseltine camp say John Major 's campaign is so identified with Norman Tebbitt and Nicholas Ridley on the Tory right that it would put off many M Ps

The Labour M P Mr Tony Benn is on his way to Jordan on the first part of his journey to Iraq

He hopes to meet President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad to discuss the possibility of a peaceful settlement to the Gulf Crisis and to try to secure the release of some of the British hostages

Mr Benn has denied that his trip would be used by the Iraqis for propaganda

He said if he stayed silent the British government would be able to say the country was united for war 

At least ten people have been killed in three separate attacks in Israel and southern Lebanon

Last night five Arabs in a speedboat died when an Israeli gunboat intercepted their vessel off the south Lebanon coast

This morning an Arab woman carried out a suicide attack on an army patrol in Israel 's security zone in south Lebanon and four Israelis died when a gunman shot at a tourist bus on the border between Israel and Egypt

Egypt 's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs has expressed regret for the incident

Here 's our Jerusalem correspondent Alex Brodie

Four Israelis were killed and twenty-four wounded close to the Egyptian border in southern Israel when a lone gunman opened fire on a bus

These details were given by the Israeli embassy in Cairo

The military in Israel have so far refused to give any details

However it confirms reports of an attack on Israel 's northern border when a woman carrying explosives blew herself up in the path of an Israeli patrol

She died

The Israelis say two of their soldiers were injured in the suicide attack

It was in Israel 's self-declared security zone of southern Lebanon

and it followed a clash at sea off the Lebanese coast the previous night when an Israeli gunboat sank a boat which the Israelis said was on its way to attack Israel

All five occupants were killed

Voting is well under way in Poland 's presidential election the first time the Polish people have been able to vote directly for a president

There are six candidates including the Solidarity leader Mr Lech Walesa and the Prime Minister Mr Tadeus Moshovietski

The first official results will be announced tomorrow 

A police helicopter has joined the search for two young brothers who disappeared from their home in Shropshire on Friday evening

Police have asked people living in the area to check garden sheds and other outbuildings in case the boys have sought shelter from the cold weather

From Shrewsbury Anne Thomas reports

It 's nearly two days since nine-year-old Neil Keane and his brother twelve-year-old Ian disappeared from their home in Telford

Police are today following up information from one of the boys ' friends who says nine-year-old Neil told him last week that he was going to run away from home

It 's now known they took a rucksack of clothes with them

But police say they have no money and it 's thought they might be sleeping rough

An extensive search is being carried out today involving a police helicopter and dog handlers

It 's concentrating on a former railway line and a scrapyard near the boys ' home

Police are also carrying out house to house enquiries

The boys had never run away from home before and police are very concerned for their safety

Sussex police are appealing for witnesses to a collision between two cars on the A Two Five Nine near Worthing last night which left four people dead and five injured

Two of those hurt are said to be in a serious condition

The accident between a Ford Cortina and a Vauxhall Nova happened at about eleven forty-five last night at Angmering on the coast road which was closed for four hours

The identities of those who died haven't been released 

Corrie Corfield 

The cold war era then is drawing to a close

It was always rather hard to believe that three men aspiring to the most important job in the land could compete without a drop of political blood being spilled

The unity-minded candidates themselves mind you are still behaving in some measure as if they were involved in a gentlemanly duel where you shake hands with your opponent before dispatching him and never utter an unkind word about him in public

But some of their supporters with fewer scruples are now putting live bullets in the breach

and at the same time the last of the big guns are being rolled into position ready for a final assault

This morning Lord Whitelaw the man on whom Mrs Thatcher relied for so long as a trusty lieutenant revealed his own preference to succeed her

Well I have decided for a long time uh and the answer is I am very keen indeed to see Douglas Hurd as the next leader of the Conservative Party and the next Prime Minister

Why

Uh because he has had a considerable experience the most experience of any of the candidates in very high office

I saw him at work when I was in the Cabinet both in Northern Ireland where I had been before and of course at the Home Office where I had also been

And in both cases I thought he did the job extremely well and I admired very much what he was doing

Since then he 's been Foreign Secretary and he 's been shown in all the dealings over the Gulf and in the Middle East and the rest to have a very safe pair of hands

Now you 've made your decision today

You say you you 'd made up your mind some time ago

Why have you waited till now when Douglas Hurd seems to need all the help he can get

Well I am rather diffident as a member of the House of Lords  who 's not got a vote in trumpeting about uh telling people about my views when in fact uh the people who 've got the votes are the Members of Parliament of the House of Commons

When I saw that some other members of the House of Lords such as Lord Carrington had taken a view I thought it was up to me to make my view clear too so that those people in the House of Commons and apparently you cos you 're interviewing me now would like to know what my views are

That 's why I decided it was the right time to do it

Mr Hurd is presenting himself as the main candidate to achieve the unity of the party

Do you think he would do that better than the others than say Mr Heseltine

I think he would be extremely good leader of a cabinet

I think he 's much the best person to unite the party 

Lord Whitelaw

Douglas Hurd will doubtless be grateful for that endorsement not least because of the pressure he must be feeling this morning

The opinion polls are united on one thing at least

Both Mr Hurd 's opponents would provide the Conservative Party with a bigger electoral boost than he would

And for a party approaching a general election that must be a somewhat important consideration

In the welter of claims and counter claims about the numbers of M Ps signed up by each camp Mr Hurd 's team has been distinctly coy

But we asked Dr John Curtis a psephologist who lectures at Strathclyde University for his assessment of the Foreign Secretary 's prospects in Tuesday 's second ballot

Mr Hurd 's chances are looking increasingly weak

He uh evidently is uh probably third amongst M Ps even at the moment and today 's polls suggest that he 's he 's not going to ha add much electoral appeal to the Conservatives

indeed he 's probably a negative

So I think his position is looking very weak this morning indeed 

In order for him to proceed to the third round what will he have to achieve in the second bearing in mind he 's obviously not going to win it

I think he 's got to first of all have the votes of at least a hundred M Ps an absolute minimum and really probably about a hundred and twenty

And secondly he must not be too far off the second person if he doesn't manage to get second himself

If he 's way behind the second person if he has a weak vote less than three figures then he 's not going to be able to put himself forward as a credible compromise candidate on the third ballot

Although technically of course he could do so

couldn't he

He could still go through to the third ballot

He he can still go through assuming of course that John Major or Michael Heseltine don't succeed in getting the margin at a hundred and eighty-seven votes on the first ballot

I think perhaps one of the questions in the next forty-eight hours is whether or not John Major 's uh steamroller can go on fast enough to get to the magic a hundred and eighty-seven on the first ballot or not

Dr John Curtis

Well one of the indisputable elements of the Thatcher era was the importance of image in the make-up of a prime minister

Could a change of image help Douglas Hurd make up some ground in the race to become one

Winston Fletcher a former adviser to the S D P believes Mr Hurd needs a new approach

He has decided that the important thing in the first instance is to unite the Tories

And his image that he 's portraying is that of a warm lovable teddy bear that everyone in the party can feel affectionate towards

and that may just win him through the next few days

but in the long term he 's going to need a much more positive image than that

The fact is that the party would unite behind a teenage mutant ninja turtle if they were convinced that the turtle would beat  Neil Kinnock

And he 's going to have to convince the party uh not just that he 's warm and lovable and can unite them but that that he can beat Neil Kinnock

And for that his image is less than perfect at the moment

Winston Fletcher

Well earlier this morning I spoke to Douglas Hurd and I suggested first that the Sunday papers this morning must have made depressing reading

I 'm not at all depressed

The big change has been that whereas uh a few days ago it seemed that Michael Heseltine uh was the only person ahead in the polls now the polls sh show quite clearly that all three of us could beat Labour

There 's a very big change for the better

But it still places you very clearly in third place behind the others the least likely the least attractive to the electorate and therefore perhaps to M Ps as well

I think what it shows is that there 's an the the Labour support in the country is very soft

The next election will depend on not on opinion polls taken yesterday

It will depend on how successful we are as a government in getting ourselves together stopping this this scratching and bickering and dealing with the problems which are going to face us next year

That 's what the next election will be about

Good evening

There are six and a half hours left in which to pursue a diplomatic solution to the Gulf crisis

but scarcely anyone involved thinks it 's achievable

Once the deadline of midnight New York time has passed is war the only option

Here in New York the United Nations Security Council is trying to agree on the text of a last minute appeal to Iraq

In the judgement of observers here the effort is not expected to change anything 

In Paris Francine Stock examines the thinking behind the last minute French initiative and wonders what they hope to gain from it 

After what one M P called their most important debate since the last world war the House of Commons voted half an hour ago to support the government 's handling of the Gulf crisis

Fifty-seven voted against

We continue that debate in the studio with three senior privy counsellors Sir Geoffrey Howe Sir David Steel and Denis Healey 

And Newsnight visits the front line where the last civilians are fleeing as the military move in 

There was a last spasm of optimism for a few hours today that the world might find a way of settling the Gulf crisis by diplomacy

It proved unfounded

And tonight the French Prime Minister his initiative snubbed said the time had come to use force to get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait 

The rejection of the last minute French initiative came four hours ago after which King Hussein of Jordan told his people the region was staring into an abyss and a very destructive war was about to begin

The French initiative had done the thing which both Britain and the United States had explicitly and repeatedly rejected and linked the questions of Kuwait and Palestine

But it wasn't enough to satisfy the Iraqis

Their Information Minister Latif Jassim was unmoved









The French initiative threw the United Nations Security Council into confusion precisely because it had seemed to offer Saddam Hussein some of what he wanted

It was a six point plan

There 'd be a final appeal for peace to Iraq

Iraq would then make a full-scale withdrawal from Kuwait

The U N would monitor the withdrawal and deploy a peace-keeping force

It included a guarantee that Iraq wouldn't be attacked

The plan allowed for further negotiations for a peaceful solution to the Gulf crisis

The sixth proposal was the most controversial committing the U N Security Council to an international conference on regional problems including Palestine

Throughout the day members of the Security Council have been in one huddle after another trying to agree on whether at midnight tonight diplomacy is officially declared dead

Charles Wheeler has spent the day in New York 

Only one of the fifteen member nations of the Security Council has a clear unambiguous position in this last ditch attempt to keep the diplomatic process going

That 's the United States

Washington 's view is negative

It is that diplomacy is over that the United Nations ' Secretary General 's failed mission to Baghdad was the final act

and the Security Council should not now be muddying the waters

Britain agrees with this but is reluctant to be seen to be slamming any doors

And with the Soviet Union 's support Britain has produced a draft statement in the name of the President of the Security Council that offends nobody and tells the world that the Council is still working for peace 

It was the French who broke ranks with a draft statement that in effect proposed linkage between an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and the promise of a Middle East peace conference on the Palestine question

That was too much for the Americans whose ambassador Thomas Pickering spent the day with a mobile phone glued to his ear in continuous consultation with his masters in Washington 

It was Britain 's ambassador Sir David Hannay who took on the thankless job of explaining why Washington and London would have nothing to do with the proposal from Paris

Ministers in London have considered the whole question of an appeal

And their view is that to be effective it needs to be rapid clear unambiguous

And that means not encumbering it with a lot of detail which could confuse the situation weaken the impact of the deadline and genuinely generally uh diffuse uh the impact

As for the French they abandoned their bid when it became clear that any statement requiring the unanimous support of the Council was bound to fail 

As the crowds outside the United Nations headquarters demonstrate against war there is a growing conviction among delegates here that even if the midnight deadline is not immediately followed by fighting the diplomatic process has run its course

But the sense of hopelessness has not entirely silenced half a dozen of the smaller countries that is the non-permanent members of the Security Council

Countries like India whose ambassador I talked to today







Even though 

Well Charles Wheeler is uh in the U N studio in New York and he is able to join us there uh from there live now

Charles uh do you have any indication of what sort of initiative the Indians and others may be hoping to achieve

No Jeremy they aren't really hoping

They 've given up hope

I mean this is really a charade

It 's a sort of game

it 's uh shadow dancing

A lot of countries half a dozen who were not members of the Security Council when the Israeli 's key resolutions were passed who 'd just become members are determined to try and do something

but they all know there is nothing at this stage they can do

Uh the Americans are determined to keep these consultations these so-called consultations going at least until midnight and by then it will really be too late

Or that in any case is the American view and the British undoubtedly are on the American side

And I think the French are coming around too now just saying there 's nothing they can do either

And the Russians are sitting somewhere

They too want to be seen to be going through the motions of trying to do something but knowing that it 's too late

Uhm if one was looking for uhm a word to sum up the mood then in the U N tonight uh what would it be 

For all the usual cliches sombre frightened depressed uh I can't think of any new words

I 've been using them all in the last three days and honestly nothing has changed

How close did the Security Council come to fracturing over the uh French initiative

It is fractured

Uh there 're some five or six countries that would 've liked to 've supported it but they 're all realists

To get a resolution through or even a statement in the name of the President of the Council the agreement on the words has to be unanimous

There was no hope ever of any uninamity any unanimity when it came to any mention of linkage or anything like linkage by another name

So there was never any hope that the Security Council could agree on this

The Americans were adamant

The British were adamant

It was hopeless

So that 's why I am calling it shadow boxing why I 'm calling it charades

There never was any hope but you can't just if you 're a member of the Security Council a member of the United Nations you cannot be seen to have packed up closed shop gone home uh twelve hours before the deadline

Uh there is an expectation that uh Xavier Perez de Cuellar is about to is going to make some statement about uh about now

Do you have any indication of what he can possibly say in that statement then

All he 's been saying today is I 'm not a member of the Security Council

Don't ask me

So I think uh Perez de Cuellar has probably been prevailed on to uh to to come out with some kind of platitude that will uh give all these reporters who were sitting around here all day waiting for something to happen something to report

But quite honestly I can't see that Perez de Cuellar or anybody else uh can come up with anything at this late hour

Charles Wheeler thank you 

Well the French attempt to broker a settlement at the last minute met with scarcely concealed fury from the Foreign Office and the American State Department

They were angry not only at the explicit linkage between the invasion of Kuwait and a possible conference on Palestine but also at the fact that despite French claims to the contrary they 'd been bounced into it without prior warning

When he 'd gathered his breath John Major said the French plan failed the test both of compliance with U N resolutions and of whether it was likely to achieve its objective

In the event it also failed to arouse a glimmer of interest in Baghdad

Francine Stock in Paris watched this last throw 

Last night Parisians came to pray

At Notre Dame the Archbishop called on the international community to oppose the law of blood

Elsewhere in the city their government put forward much the same message in diplomatic vernacular by means of a peace initiative 

This morning despite rebuffs from the United States and Britain the government appeared bullish

It stood of course fully behind the U N resolutions

but at the same time President Mitterrand was determined in the few hours before the deadline to travel that extra diplomatic kilometre for peace 























By midday it was clear that Foreign Minister Dumas wasn't welcome in Baghdad although politicians were still arguing the case for a longer term solution to the Gulf crisis than military conflict could provide 







But the fact is you 're part of an alliance

and yet you are acting unilaterally

Now surely you have to make up your minds whether you 're in the alliance and you accept it or you 're not



Tomorrow the National Assembly is likely to vote that French troops deployed in the Gulf should fight if hostilities begin

This evening Prime Minister Rocard addressed the socialist parliamentary group as the life ebbed from the French peace initiative

Then the coup de grace

Even the Iraqis rejected it 

Michel Rocard told the meeting that France had done everything in its power to avoid war

but there 'd been no response not the slightest sign he said from Iraq

and all else having failed the moment for force had alas arrived

Well within the hour his defence minister the man who 'd sued most vociferously for peace was girding his loins for battle

This evening French police were out in force at key points around the city

They were on the alert for anti-war demonstrations

But also as one policeman said they were ready for the dawn deadline and any possible terrorist attack 

The Iraqi rejection of the French initiative came in an interview with the B B C 's foreign affairs editor John Simpson

And Saddam Hussein himself in a statement confirmed that there would be no negotiations and that Iraq is embarking on a jihad a holy war

The author Roald Dahl has died in hospital in Oxford at the age of seventy-four

He was a prolific writer who was best known for his adult horror stories and for his books for children 

Nearly thirty years after he wrote his first best selling children 's book Roald Dahl 's remarkable writing is more popular than ever

It started with James and the Giant Peach

Another eighteen were to follow

Among them The B F G and the now legendary Charlie and the Chocolate Factory

Dahl once attributed his talent to a bump on the head in an air-crash in World War Two



Dahl 's books often portrayed children battling against evil adults

Last year alone they sold more than two million

Yet despite their popularity many parents who read the books regretted the decision to buy them

They were sometimes said to be bizarre grotesque even cruel 

He 's we felt that he was speaking to the children

and if they could get through to his characters and the story that he wished to tell he didn't really mind at all what adults felt about them

It was the children he wanted to reach

As an adult author Dahl 's fame was to come much later when his Tales of the Unexpected were transferred to television

Yet it will be as a children 's writer he 'll be remembered

His lasting legacy includes another two books still to be published

Roald Dahl who 's died at the age of seventy-four 

Britain 's junior doctors have complained again that the long hours they work are a danger to patients

And they say they 're prepared to take industrial action to back their demands for shorter hours

A report next 

Plus a North Sea submarine sinks another trawler

The Minister says there will be an enquiry 

And help 's arriving to relieve another siege of Leningrad

That 's in a couple of minutes

A survey of junior hospital doctors shows many are in favour of taking industrial action over the long hours they have to work

More than half the country 's junior doctors took part in the British Medical Association survey

Of those almost forty-nine per cent said they 'd opt for providing an emergency only service in order to win a shorter working week

Our home affairs correspondent Libby Weiner has been to the Bristol Maternity Hospital to see a junior doctor work a shift lasting thirty-two hours

It 's been a busy week on the special care baby unit for Dr Fiona Finley

She 's already worked five days but instead of a weekend off she 'll be doing a thirty-two hour shift 

Steve Jones the doctor she 'll take over from has worked a hundred and four hours this week and is due back on Sunday night 

Eight thirty Saturday morning

Dr Finley begins the shift she does every third weekend 

Twenty babies have been born overnight and she has to check they 're all healthy 

Her work 's regularly interrupted

She 's the only junior doctor on call

Her mum could go home and have it checked by the midwife at home on Monday

At the weekend she has to do all the blood tests herself

By six o'clock she 's hardly had a break but she 's still got another twenty-four hours to go

Now there 's a staffing problem

The doctor due to take over on Sunday is sick and the registrar can't find anyone else

I mean Fiona 's out of the question

She 's she would already di have done thirty-two hours

Nim is on the next night and Christine 's on holiday

Not knowing if she 'll have to stay on Dr Finley is called away to attend a Caesarean operation

It 's an emergency 

The doctors are having difficulty removing the baby

They decide to use forceps

Dr Finley worried that the baby is suffocating calls in the registrar

She doesn't even have time to change her clothes 

But after a few anxious moments the baby is breathing 

It 's a girl Hannah Louise

And the waiting 's over for her dad 









When the baby came out it was in it was in  condition

Does that get your adrenalin going something like that

It does

Yes

You 've woken up now

Yes 

By midnight Dr Finley 's attended to five deliveries all of which were causing concern 

As she 's finally getting to bed an hour later she 's bleeped again

But this time it 's a false alarm 

On the special care baby unit the nurses unlike the doctors have changed shift for the night 

Three o'clock

and Doctor Finley is up again after just an hour and a half 's sleep 

A premature baby is having breathing difficulties and she has to measure the oxygen in its blood 

It 's this kind of routine work where she says her concentration is most affected 

Sometimes you don't go to bed at all

But three hours or so 's a reasonably typical amount

Is that enough to be fully rested 

Well when I go home today I 'll  go to bed more or less immediately 

Seven o'clock Sunday morning and the ward is beginning to wake up

Dr Finley 's back on duty

She 's been woken four times in the night and the longest sleep she had was an hour and a half 

There 's just time for a cup of coffee with the senior doctors on duty before Dr Finley begins her morning checks of the babies born overnight 

There 'd been a total of twenty including the emergency Caesarean which she attended 

Mid-afternoon and she still doesn't know whether she 'll have to do another night shift 

But by five o'clock a doctor has been found to replace her 

It 's now thirty-two hours since she began her shift

And like all junior doctors her pay for each hour 's weekend work has been two pounds and fourteen pence

There 's to be an enquiry into the deaths of four fishermen whose boat sank after its nets were caught by a nuclear powered submarine

The Armed Officers Minister Archy Hamilton called it a freak accident

He said there were no plans to stop submarines operating off the west coast of Scotland where the fishing boat Antares went down near the Isle of Arran yesterday morning 

H M S Trenchant snagged a trawl net off the Isle of Arran yesterday

The submarine surfaced but found no trace of the fishing vessel which had already sunk

A search by boats and planes revealed the wreckage of the Antares on the sea bed 

The boat was similar to this one

Its four crew are presumed dead

At her home port of Caridale today there was deep shock

The families just want the bodies recovered

Uh we realise now  it 's bodies 

Even last night one or two were hoping that maybe  somewhere somebody was safe 

In the past decade dozens of fishing boat accidents have been blamed on submarine activity in the Irish Sea area

Not all have been proven

In nineteen eighty-eight the navy admitted four incidents with fishing nets and damage to two yachts

In eighty-nine they admitted six net incidents but there were no casualties

The navy says yesterday 's was their first incident this year

The really sad thing about it is that that that the men who fish in the Clyde and the navy have a fairly well developed liaison system designed precisely to avoid what has happened here

and yet it has happened

And we we have to get to the bottom of that 

At Westminster today the Government announced an enquiry and offered condolences to the families of the fishermen

The crew of Trenchant and the entire submarine community are also I know shocked and deeply saddened 

In the fishing communities of the Clyde there is some anger that such accidents can happen 

I would like all submarine activity in the Clyde to stop until we know the outcome of that enquiry

Otherwise there could be another incident exactly like the Antares with more deaths because we don't know how to stop this kind of thing happening 

The government won't stop submarine activities but hopes that fitting trawl nets with bleepers in future could enable submarines to avoid them 

The I R A have tried to blow up an army checkpoint with the biggest bomb ever used in a terrorist attack in Northern Ireland

Three and a half thousand pounds of explosives were packed into a hijacked van

and a man was forced at gun point to drive it to the border crossing point at Anagmartin in County Fermanagh

The detonator exploded

but the main bomb failed to go off

and no one was hurt 

President Mikhail Gorbachev has been formally voted sweeping powers to sort out the country 's political and economic chaos

And the Supreme Soviet say he 's got just two weeks to draw up a detailed plan of action

Some deputies have accused Mr Gorbachev of trying to set up a dictatorship

He says the country faces paralysis unless a solution is found quickly 

Sunrise over Leningrad 's docks brought relief to Russia 's proud second city 

This shipment of aid five thousand food parcels from Germany the gift for a people reduced to begging abroad to feed themselves as a bleak winter sets in 

Leningrad 's harbour is once again providing a lifeline for a city which only fifty years ago faced starvation during its wartime blockade

Hundreds of thousands died then and that memory haunts the elderly 

The shops are empty

Rationing 's imminent

And there 's a real fear that starvation will be a reality once more









But now there 's charity for a people who feel their own government 's failed them

Food clothing just basics but enough to help a Russian family through the winter 

Ludmilla and Konstantin Varinova have eight children and until today no certainty that they 'd be able to feed them beyond Christmas 







For the children there 's innocent excitement

For the parents genuine relief

With America Germany and the E E C pledging more aid there 's now hope from abroad for a people losing hope at home

The Conservative leadership race is wide open tonight

An I T N poll shows that although Mr Heseltine is the most popular with the voters any of the three contenders could beat Labour at the next general election

Mr Major and Mr Hurd began campaigning in earnest today

Both have said they 'd have Mr Heseltine in their cabinet

An enquiry 's begun into the sinking of a trawler by a nuclear sub off the Scottish coast and the author Roald Dahl has died at the age of seventy-four 

Finally Mr Hurd may not be the bookmakers ' favourite to win the leadership race

but ten years ago he thought the odds rather longer than they are tonight

Corals make Mr Major favourite at eleven to ten with Mr Heseltine second at five to four

Mr Hurd is trailing with odds of seven to two

But when he was a Foreign Office Minister he put his chances of being Prime Minister at ten thousand  to one

I don't see myself actually  doing that particular job

so I think uh ten thousand to one is about right

But then that was way back when

From Julia and from me goodnight

The Ministry of Defence has called on two thousand five hundred naval reservists to volunteer for duty because of the Gulf crisis

Official letters have been sent out to the Royal Fleet Reserve

There 's said to be a shortage of engineers and communications medical and supply officers

It 's thought most of the volunteers would serve in Britain helping to release other personnel

Earlier two hundred and fifty members of the Territorial Army reported for duty in Glasgow after volunteering for the Gulf

They 're among the first medical reservists to report for active duty 

The Foreign Office has advised British dependants in Jordan and Yemen to leave the two countries well before January the fifteenth the deadline set for Iraq 's withdrawal from Kuwait

The advice was broadcast by the B B C 's World Service

King Hussein of Jordan arrived in Britain two hours ago

The European Community has appealed for a truce in the fighting between the government and rebels in Somalia

Around five hundred Western citizens are still in the capital Mogadishu

That 's the news summary

There 's a gale warning

Attention

all shipping especially in sea areas Fisher and German Bight

The Meteorological Office issued the following gale warning to shipping at one six one five G M T today Wednesday

Fisher German Bight south-westerly severe gale force nine

now decreased gale force eight

increasing severe gale force nine soon

And that 's the end of the gale warning

Two and a half thousand naval reservists have now been asked to volunteer for duty during the Gulf crisis

And the Foreign Office today advised British dependants in Jordan and Yemen to leave the area well before the January fifteenth deadline after which the United Nations has authorised the use of force to get the Iraqis out of Kuwait

The United States has issued similar advice to their their citizens in the area

Today too the German Foreign Minister said that the European Community should fulfil its responsibility and talk to Iraq about settling the crisis without a war 

E C foreign ministers will meet on Friday for emergency talks

More on that later

First though the call for naval volunteers

Captain Richard Sharp editor of Jane 's Fighting Ships is on the line

We heard in the news summary just now Captain Sharp that the navy say they 're short of uh engineers and communications medical and supply personnel

Uh th th the volunteer reservists if they do volunteer they won't be taken straight out to the Gulf in those roles

will they 

No

As I understand it uh these people will be mainly employed in the United Kingdom taking the role of billets which or or filling the billets which have been gapped because people have had to go out  to take up posts like for instance in the new headquarters in Riyadh

Uh

are you surprised at this uhm

I know it 's not a call up

but this call for volunteers

Or does everybody know the Royal Navy 's rather short of people anyway

No I don't think so

I think all three services have been cut down to the point where there is no slack

There 's no spare capacity for this sort of operation

So if additional people are required they 've got to be called from the reserves

I think it 's worth saying that these are fleet reservists which are servicemen who have been regulars recently rather than the R N R which are of course the sort of weekend uhm naval people who 'll mostly mine uhm man minesweepers and tasks like that

And these fleet reservists

if they 're in the end called up if not enough of them volunteer they 'll have to go will they

Yes

Uh again as I understand it they want about five hundred from the two thousand five hundred they 've asked

And I would be very surprised if they don't get that number uh from people who 've recently been serving in the navy

So th they 're aiming high 

Well I think they 've done much as the Army did

They 've asked uh they 've sent out letters to far more people than they need hoping that they will get the required numbers

Captain Sharp thank you for joining us on P M

The news that the Foreign Office was advising British dependants in Jordan and Yemen to leave well before January the fifteenth was broadcast on the B B C World Service earlier today

B B C World Service 

Here 's a message from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London

It has the following advice for British communities in Jordan and Yemen 











I asked the Jordanian Minister of Information Mr Ibrahim Izedin for his reaction to the British Foreign Office advice to British citizens









Do you have any idea yet how many people that would involve



Mr Izedin do you think it 's necessary for them to leave







Can I ask you Mr Izedin about King Hussein 's visit

He 's arriving in Britain today

I believe he 's touring other capital cities in Europe

Does he come here with any new initiative 













But the E E C is saying that they are only going to reiterate what has already been said and that is that the Iraqis must pull out of Kuwait

They 're not saying they 're going to come up with any new ideas













The Jordanian Minister of Information Mr Ibrahim Izedin

In Cairo today foreign ministers from Egypt Syria and Libya met to discuss the possibility of an Arab summit this coming Friday between the leaders of their three countries

They met with the Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak

And according to the Libyan leader a summit would take place in the Libyan capital Tripoli 

I asked Patrick Seal a writer and expert on Arab affairs about the importance of such a summit if it goes ahead

It 's one of a s whole series of diplomatic moves which are taking place now which are all aimed at averting war

and of which of course the most important is the likely visit to the region of Secretary James Baker which many people see as a signal to the Iraqis to invite him to Baghdad

And so all sorts of people are trying to get in on the act

Now what we are now seeing as well is that the Arabs are trying to get in on the act and are trying to acquire some leverage as it were over these issues of war and peace

Uh haven't they left it a bit late 

Well the Arabs have I think been a little bit slow with the sole exception of Syria of President Assad of Syria

They 've been a bi a bit slow at understanding how dangerous and potentially catastrophic a war would be to their interests

It would shatter the Arab world enfeeble it  in particular vis-&agrave;-vis both Iran and Israel

They suddenly see it as a run up to another nineteen sixty-seven which of course was the great big set-back in modern Arab history when Israel emerged as a sort of imperial power and occupied large tracts of Arab territory which it s of course it still is it still holds

But ca could they really come up now with anything new

I mean we 've already heard the words of uhm Saddam Hussein about Hosni Mubarak in the last few days

So it doesn't seem as if much love is lost between them

Well what is clear you see uh is that Saddam Hussein is not going to pull out unconditionally

He would rather face war than simply uh have to back down face a humiliating climb down

He wants some limited gains

Now the world is puzzling about what how these gains can be offered and what sort of gains 

Patrick Seal

And listening with us here in the studio is our diplomatic correspondent Paul Reynolds

Uhm

Paul first of all the Foreign Office warning to dependants British dependants in Jordan and Yemen

They say it 's just precautionary 

But is it revealing

Yes

It is

And it 's all about risk

Uh those two countries there 's been a lot of popular sentiment in favour of Saddam Hussein

And uh the Foreign Office has reckoned that there might well be animosity towards uh British and other nationals especially if they 're of those countries taking part in any hostilities which involve Iraq

There hasn't been a lot of animosity even towards British nationals in Iraq itself

They 're staying

Well war hasn't started yet

Uh no well that 's the Arab world

I mean the Arab world will be very very hospitable

But of course uh foreign governments uh warning their citizens have to take wider things into ac into account

Uh now the other the other matter the crucial matter this Friday

There 's not only the possibility of an Arab summit

The E E C foreign ministers are definitely meeting

A are they having a a a panic meeting and are they divided

Because there 's the German foreign minister saying that we must talk

We must avoid war

Well I think there will be a decision to have a contact with Tariq Aziz

There 's a very interesting behind the scenes discussion wrangling if you like going on about how that should be done

The British are very much against an emissary going to Baghdad

And I don't think uh one will go

I don't think you could have have that

So the argument is is now rev revolving about ha how and who he should see

Should he see the troika the past present and immediate future presidents

The British are against that because that would bring the Italians in and they 're felt to be a weak link

And uh so it 's the latest idea is to have Tariq Aziz come to Europe perhaps next week and meet all twelve foreign ministers

This would bring in uh everybody with an interest in the area and several without a direct interest

And that seems to be the most likely outcome

Paul thank you very much

Our diplomatic correspondent Paul Reynolds

Well despite the international political condemnation of Saddam Hussein there 's been so far very little sign of any organised political opposition to his regime from those Iraqis who 've fled the country

However a coalition of Iraqi opposition groups has now come together to form the Iraqi National Joint Action Committee

The Kurdish Democratic Party is one of its members

France and Germany have urged the European Community to forge a common defence policy at the first meeting of E C foreign ministers since the outbreak of the Gulf War

The German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher said that the war showed the need to make security part and parcel of a joint Community foreign policy

However the plan got a lukewarm reception from some countries including Britain

The Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said that the Gulf War had exposed deep divisions and differences between member states on key issues

At the same meeting the E C foreign ministers agreed to lift sanctions against South Africa as soon as President De Klerk starts fulfilling his pledge to repeal the apartheid laws

Our political correspondent Eleanor Goodman at I T N reports 

The European Community 's difficulties in agreeing how to respond to the Gulf War has added to the problems of foreign ministers trying to agree a formula for political union

For while the British believe that the Gulf has reinforced their view that the way ahead must be through improved cooperation between individual national governments the Germans argue that on the contrary it showed that such negotiations always reduce initiatives in the field of foreign affairs to the lowest common denominator 

As ministers went in it was clear that all regarded this issue as central 









Ministers chatted affably before today 's meeting

But as the E E C President Jacques Delors has admitted the Community has not acquitted itself well over Iraq with the Belgians refusing to supply ammunition to the British the French and the Germans backing a last minute diplomatic initiative and then the Germans only belatedly making a substantial contribution to the war effort 

Privately I think that the majority of the European leaders and the diplomats believe that the Gulf crisis has shown that the Community can no longer afford not to have the authority to decide uh to act and speak with one voice in an area like this

Many of them feel that they 've been sucked step by step into a situation they don't they do not fully control and the consequences of a war which they fear may leave the Middle East in a more troubled state than we found it

And for all of those reasons they say never again

We want the Community to have much more authority to speak with a single voice and to take collective action in these crucial matters that affect all our interests

The British agreed today that a European foreign policy was a necessity not a luxury

But Douglas Hurd argued that the best way of achieving such a policy was through closer cooperation of national governments through existing bodies like the Council of Ministers rather than by giving the Commission new powers to initiate policy

The new structures it was said wouldn't themselves conceal policy differences

But the French insisted that the war had not weakened the will of the twelve to put in their place a common foreign and defence policy

Together with the Germans they proposed developing a British plan how to use the western European union as the basis of a European defence policy and less acceptably to the British giving foreign ministers new powers to implement defence policy through majority voting

What the majority seem to want is that the heads of government the prime ministers ' meeting and the regular summits of the Community should lay down certain areas of common collective foreign policy-making

They would set out what these policy areas would be and then the foreign ministers of the twelve would implement those policies on the basis of majority voting

Now the British will not like that uh but they are I understand preparing some alternative proposals themselves

And once again we 'll have a situation I think where the majority will set the pace and the British will slowly but eventually follow

The meeting did agree though that any moves to forge a common defence policy should not be legally binding

The constraints on member governments would be purely political so in practice probably wouldn't prevent individual governments going it alone as they did in the Gulf

Afterwards Douglas Hurd said he didn't go along with those who thought the whole idea of European cooperation a farce but that he had stressed there had to be consensus

We 're not going to get a  progress on this just by altering the nature of our machinery 

The defects evident from the Gulf crisis were not caused by absence of machinery or the breakdown in machinery 

They were more basic than that

They dealt with substance

Uh so that uh I was clear so that we needed to proceed in these matters by consensus

But the message of today 's meeting was that the majority of European countries still have much more ambitious plans for political union than Britain is prepared to contemplate

Our political editor Eleanor Goodman 

Well now we 're joined from Westminster by the former Cabinet Minister Nicholas Ridley

Mr Ridley do you sense that the war is changing some political attitudes towards Europe down there at Westminster 

Yes I think it is

I I don't think it 's the most  uh uh important element in the debate about political union and economic and monetary union

But it just seems to have come along at this time

And it 's an example of the uh hopelessness of the Europeans when faced with a crisis which is nothing to do with Europe but is outside the area of Europe because of course traditionally they have always been concerned with what happens within the Continent and left what happens outside the Continent to others including ourselves

Uh that I think is uh uh certainly uhm a new factor

But it 's of course one which doesn't alter the fundamental objections to political and economic and monetary union which uh have always been there

But uh Mr Genscher today was saying that actually what 's happened over the Gulf as far as Europe 's concerned only illustrates  too clearly that there has to be a common foreign policy and probably a common defensive policy as well

Yes

But uh look

if there had been a common foreign and a common defence policy before the Gulf crisis and during the Gulf War it would 've been that Europe would 've kept right out of it had nothing to do with it

and we would 've been constrained and prevented from helping the Americans uh and from doing what we know to be right in dealing with Saddam Hussein in

uh Iraq

Uh now if that is going to be the result and we would by majority voted voting have been voted right out of our policy then nothing of that sort uh is acceptable to the British 

But I wonder Mr

Mr Ridley where do you define the difference between what appears to have been a very collective European view when it came to the United Nations ' resolutions which did after all include the endorsement of force and the apparent difference of opinion we have over the use of force within Europe

Well there were three stages

The first stage was when uh before war broke out when the French se aided and abetted by the Germans had a last minute secret attempt to sort out uhm peace with uh Iraq behind the backs of their allies and the rest of the Community

John Major was there that very morning and he and he was never even told about it

Bu bu but Mr Ridley

Secondly the second stage was when the war started a and the French have made a a a half-hearted contribution with forces

But they have not put those forces under the Allied Command

And we have therefore only two countries ourselves and the French who 've made any sizeable effort at all to assist in the war

Then there 's the question of paying for it

And we 've seen the shambles that they all got into over that as well

So I don't think they have behaved well at any stage frankly

But Mr Ridley I am sure certainly the French would take grave obs exception to the way in which you 've described their contribution not least because it appears to have been their pilots who 've taken out the brunt of these chemical weapons plants as we saw last night 

Uh I mean they they would certainly argue they 're playing a very full part

The Germans are paying a great deal of money uh

And we who happen to be in a better position than the others to be able to send any troops have sent some troops 

Well I don't think that uh follows at all

I think we 've sent far more troops than any other European nation

And I I don't think that it is helpful to have uh the French not being part of the unified command because that is the only way that you can integrate the efforts of all the allies as indeed every other member of the allied force is integrated into the same command structure

But Mr Ridley when you press officials here particularly in the Foreign Office about how disquieted they are about the German contribution or indeed the French they actually say they 're not very worried about either issue

and indeed they 're quite happy that at the moment the is the there 's a very collective European performance here

Well that only uh I think is a good argument for not pressing officials

You 're talking surely you should be talking to the politicians not to the officials

Uh I I would like to hear more of those officials

I would think those officials were uh had some ulterior motive

I can't think what it might be

But uh I am speaking what most people in the street in Britain are saying that why do we have to carry the heat and burden of the day uh

and why do they then want us to get into a political union which would in fact effectively have prevented us from doing what we call our duty

You you You 're acting 

But you see what German diplomats that one talks to tell you is that they haven't actually been pressed very hard by the Ministry of Defence for for funds

They haven't been pressed very hard by the Foreign Office either and and that this is an issue which has been whipped up for internal domestic uhm considerations

Well that may be their view of it

But uh it it 's not my view of it is all I can say

Uh uh I do think I 'd like to see the Germans making  immediate moves to change their constitution so that they can take part in the policing operations out of the area of NATO

Uh I have seen no sign of that yet so far

Uh I would like to see them uh helping with logistics of all sorts

I was disappointed that the Belgians felt they shouldn't supply ammunition to us

There 's a whole series of incidents of this sort which I think has made uh the British feel that this is no sort of a group for them to want to join a political union particularly as they are going to be coerced by it

I agree entirely with Douglas Hurd that we would like to uh coordinate foreign policy but it must not be coercive

The World This Weekend

This is Nick Clarke

And the main news today is that the huge Allied land offensive to liberate Kuwait is well under way 

The Prime Minister has said it 's a massive encounter that will not be finished until the Iraqis have been driven out of Kuwait 

Few details have emerged from the battle front but reports speak of large numbers of Iraqi prisoners

Baghdad says it is containing the attacks

It 's urging its troops on to victory or death

From Moscow there 's been regret that the Soviet peace effort did not succeed 

And in today 's programme we 'll be hearing from political leaders at home including the Defence Secretary Tom King and the Labour leader Neil Kinnock

We 'll also have reaction to events in the Gulf from the Soviet Union Jordan Israel and the United States 

The massive land battle to liberate Kuwait is now twelve hours old

It 's taking place behind a screen of secrecy which the Americans say is necessary to protect Allied lives

But it 's reported that thousands of troops supported by tanks have advanced into Kuwait and southern Iraq

The message which started the ground assault on the thirty-ninth day of the Gulf War came around one o'clock this morning eight hours after the expiry of the Allied ultimatum to Saddam Hussein issued by President Bush yesterday 

The Prime Minister John Major speaking to reporters outside Chequers this morning said it was a massive encounter which would not be finished until the Iraqis were driven out of Kuwait

I very much appreciate the diplomatic efforts that have been put in hand over the last few days to try and avoid this particular conflict

But they have failed 

And they have failed because at no time were the Iraqi leadership prepared to accept the Security Council resolutions in full

At no time were they prepared to do so

We have also seen in the last few days that there was neither time nor reason to delay the land battle any longer

No reason

because the Security Council resolutions were not going to be met

And no time

because of what is now happening in Kuwait City 

Uh there are now something over two hundred oil wells that have been wantonly set alight on the direct instructions of the Iraqi leadership

That number is rising hour by hour

Uh the Iraqis are engaged upon the systematic destruction of Kuwait City

We have repeated reports of young men and women being rounded up and executed in Kuwait City

Uh

murdered perhaps would be a more apt word for what is going on there

And we also have reports of large numbers of Kuwaitis being herded together on trucks and taken out of Kuwait to Iraq presumably to be used as a bargaining counter in some discussions at the end of the conflict 

Uh

I think it is clear therefore that the nature of the regime with which we are dealing is not a regime whose word you can rely upon or with whom you can deal in the normal manner

The land campaign has therefore begun 

I spoke at length yesterday afternoon not only to the leaders of a number of uh members of the Allied coalition but also to the commander of our forces in the Middle East General de la Billi&egrave;re 

Uh he was confident of what was to come

He was well prepared and assured me that the troops were well prepared

He is also well aware of the risks and the dangers that will need to be overcome in the next few days

Uh I know you will not expect me to give you any indication at this early stage of how the conflict is going

I cannot do so

It would not be in the interests of our troops to do so and they of course must be our prime concern

As soon as it is possible to say something more concrete about that then of course we will do so

Uh if I may I would like to add one final word to the families of those men who are engaged in this conflict in the Gulf 

It will not I believe be a long conflict but it may be a fierce one 

There is no doubt in my mind that it is an absolutely justifiable conflict and that we will win it

As soon as that is confirmed we will bring home the men who have been engaged in it at the earliest possible time

Saddam Hussein Mr Major went on was arrogant and unrealistic

In the Prime Minister 's words he is going to lose and lose big

I am very sorry that it has come to this

Uh a tremendous amount of effort has gone in over many months by a large number of people to ensure that we didn't come to this particular conflict

So I am saddened that it has done so

But I must say I am absolutely convinced that there is no choice and that it is right

If the Iraqis were to succeed if they were to get away with what they have sought to do over the last few months then I think that would be intolerable not just for Kuwait but for the rest of the world

So I think there is an inevitability about what is happening at the moment

And I 'm absolutely clear in my mind that it will end successfully

The Prime Minister

Details of the ground offensive are sketchy though we hope to hear from the Defence Secretary Tom King later in the programme

With what he 's been able to learn of the land battle so far here 's our defence correspondent Mark Laity in Riyadh

The Allied news blackout means there 's virtually no reliable information on the progress of the Allied ground campaign

What seems clear is that the Allies launched major assaults on the Iraqi fortifications in southern Kuwait and also to the west along the Iraq-Saudi border

A French light armoured division was one of the forces to make a thrust into Iraq and was said to be making fast progress north

The British First Armoured Division also crossed the border but was not involved in the early exchanges with the Iraqis

There 've also been reports of American armoured forces and marines striking into both Iraq and Kuwait

A Saudi spokesman said the campaign was proceeding successfully and as planned

That battle plan remains unknown

One option is to launch an outflanking manoeuvre to the west of Kuwait to surround Iraqi forces while other attacks go in across the Kuwaiti border supported by amphibious landings which also seem to be underway

What 's certain is that the Allies will be flying as many air combat missions as possible in order to support the ground forces in what the commanders hope will be a fast and violent assault that will overwhelm the Iraqis who 've already been battered from the air for five weeks

One source said that one of the biggest Allied problems so far was coping with captured and surrendering Iraqis although such troops will be of lower quality than those likely to be encountered further north

Unconfirmed reports from Saudi Arabia claim Allied troops are already inside Kuwait City

Official sources close to the Kuwaiti government in exile say residents have contacted them saying troops parachuted into Kuwait shortly after the ground battle began

Andrew Tye reports from north-eastern Saudi Arabia

There 's been no independent confirmation of the reports which have been received in Saudi Arabia via the Kuwaiti exiles ' clandestine communications network

It 's being claimed that Saudi Arabian troops are in their country 's embassy in Kuwait City which is on the coast

The same informants told sources here that Allied troops have been seen in a number of suburbs of the capital

Dr Hassinal Sinad of the Kuwait Information Ministry said he was hearing good news

He said he was personally confident in the accuracy of the initial reports although he stressed the information was still sketchy

Dr Sinad said it indicated Iraqi resistance in the city might be crumbling

And he said he believed Iraqis were surrendering in large numbers

The initial thrust into Iraqi-held territory was made by Western forces but Arab members of the coalition are also expected to be heavily involved in the ground war

Justin Webb is with Egyptian troops on the front line in northern Saudi Arabia

As dawn broke this morning Egyptian troops were preparing to play their part in the final battle for Kuwait

They had already made breaches in the defensive wall of sand they 'd built in front of them ready for tanks and infantrymen to stream through when the order came

One platoon commander told me he expected that order soon once the Americans and British had pierced Iraqi defensive positions

For the time being though the Egyptian forces have been content to wait their turn

They fired rockets and artillery last night

but where I was they made no move to advance

As they wait to join the battle the morale among Egyptians seems extremely high

The ordinary soldiers like their Western allies saying they want to push on and end the war as quickly as possible 

From the latest on the ground we turn now to diplomacy

The Soviet Union has expressed regret that the coalition forces began the land war without allowing more time for peace negotiations

President Gorbachev has been trying to achieve a diplomatic solution to the war up until the last moment

Here 's our Moscow correspondent Bridget Kendall

It was already clear yesterday from Soviet official comment that Moscow was losing hope it could persuade the United States and its allies to hold off a ground war for much longer

But the Soviet President nonetheless had continued his campaign of high-level diplomatic activity

Today the Soviet government issued a formal expression of regret that what was termed a most realistic chance to secure a peaceful outcome had been missed

The differences between the formulas accepted by Iraq and the proposals put forward by the Alliance were not so great claimed the statement

And it said a resolution could have been reached by the U N Security Council in a day or two

The Soviet leadership is still maintaining it 's not too late to continue diplomatic efforts

And it now looks likely that President Gorbachev will still continue to try to put public pressure on Washington and its allies to come to a negotiated settlement

Well I 'm joined now in the studio by our diplomatic correspondent Paul Reynolds 

Paul we heard there about the Soviet Union 's regrets that longer hadn't been given for the peace process to work

Was there any  realistic prospect ever for it working

No

I don't think so

and I think this idea that Mr Gorbachev wants the Americans to negotiate at this stage is completely unrealistic 

The war will be prosecuted until it is uh has achieved its ends 

I think what 's interesting also about the Soviet statement  is that it isn't stronger

Uh

it has expressed regret

but it hasn't expressed any great anger 

and I think the S Soviet Union is therefore sa sending out a signal to the west that it while it disagrees uh about the the failure to reach a peaceful settlement in this dispute  it doesn't want its overall relations with United States in particular to be badly affected

Have we heard yet from other important players in this diplomatic game for instance the Chinese

The Chinese have also expressed their regrets 

As you know they 've taken a more distant role in this

but their the word regret seems to be the most favourite diplomatic word knocking around rather than anger  except in one or two Arab countries where the Jordanians as you would expect have called on uh God to protect Iraq and help it repel the aggressor

What about other Arab nations particularly those within the coalition

Is there any danger that this action will force them apart

Far from it

I think that they 're uh right up there

We 've heard the Egyptian troops uh preparing to enter combat 

the Saudi Arabians are all for it

Uh

no

they 've been rock-solid from the start

and there 's no sign that they are going to break away now

And any movement at all from the United Nations

Must it simply sit Perez de Cuellar and the rest

and wait

and see what happens

I 'm afraid so

At this stage the peaceful diplomatic efforts have ended 

and the decision is now one of arms

B B C News at eight o'clock

This is Jackie Long

The headlines this morning

Iraq has launched its second missile attack on Israel

The Israeli Health Minister says it 's now almost inevitable that his country will retaliate 

There 's been intensive bombing in Baghdad overnight 

British pilots speak of their part in Operation Desert Storm

And in America the State Department says it 's been warned of a possible terrorist attack on military installations in Bangkok 

The news in detail

The war in the Gulf has taken a serious new turn

Iraq has fired more missiles at Israel

There were several explosions in Tel Aviv from where a correspondent from the American C N N television network was reporting at the time 

A long night of tension caused by three false alarms had just ended when warning sirens went off all over Israel for a fourth time 

People put on their gas masks and ran for shelter in sealed rooms

It was five thirty our time  seven thirty in the morning in Israel

A short time later several explosions were heard in Tel Aviv the city which bore the brunt of the first missile attack during Thursday night

Roger Heering has this report 

There have been reports of several explosions in Tel Aviv and possibly in Jerusalem  although a B B C correspondent in Jerusalem said he heard no explosions there 

An army spokesman said the country had again come under scud missile attack from Iraq  but refused to say which areas had been hit 

All citizens were instructed to put on their gas masks and go into sealed rooms as a protection against chemical weapon attack  although they were later told they could take off their masks  and the army now says the missiles had conventional warheads 

In Washington the Pentagon confirmed there 'd been renewed attacks against Israel  and three missiles had been launched from Iraq 

Israeli air raid alarms had already sounded three times during the night

The earlier ones had proved to be false alarms

The last attack by Iraqi Scud missiles on Israel took place on Thursday night injuring at least seven people 

The Israeli Health Minister   on hearing the news of the attacks said that his country would almost inevitably retaliate

The B B C 's diplomatic correspondent Paul Reynolds considers the political and military ramifications of such action

With yesterday 's attack tremendous pressure was put on the Israeli government to exercise restraint 

It emerged however that the word restraint used by London and Washington did not necessarily mean taking no action 

A limited response against military targets could be acceptable to them and to the main Arab members of the coalition Saudi Arabia and Egypt  who are really more interested at this stage in crushing Saddam Hussein than worrying about Israel 

However what the coalition does not want is a major Israeli strike against civilian targets  which the allied air forces have been careful to avoid

President Bush who 's spending the weekend at Camp David was woken up to be told the news of the attack on Tel Aviv

From Washington Jeremy Harris reports 

White House officials say Mr Bush who 's spending the weekend at the presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland  was woken by his National Security Adviser General Brent Schocroft  and briefed on the latest developments in Israel 

Pentagon officials say three missile launches were detected in western Iraq not long before the explosions were reported in Tel Aviv

Before leaving for Camp David Mr Bush telephoned the Israeli Prime Minister Mr Shamir to express his personal outrage at the first attack on Israel 

Washington has appealed for restraint from Israel for fear of a split in the international coalition against Iraq 

President Bush promised the biggest search and destroy mission ever to eliminate Iraqi missiles targeted on Israel 

In America the State Department says they 've been warned of the possibility of a terrorist attack in Bangkok  against American Israeli British and Australian installations 

A spokesman described it as a credible threat and said that it was believed to be related to the Gulf war 

The allied air forces have continued to bombard key military targets in Iraq and Kuwait during the night

It 's thought most Iraqi airfields have now been knocked out

but the mobile Scud missile launchers are proving more difficult to find 

The coalition forces have continued their sorties on the Iraqi capital Baghdad 

And a few minutes ago the B B C 's correspondent in Baghdad Bob Simpson managed to file this report

There were raids on the city again last night

not as concentrated as on the two previous nights

but impressive nevertheless 

Last evening two Cruise missiles could easily be seen almost drifting across the skyline to plummet into a large building on the outskirts of Baghdad 

Seconds later there was an enormous explosion 

At dawn this morning the building was seen to be damaged and there 's been no power since 

There was intense anti-aircraft fire in the darkness about three hours later 

but nothing close by our hotel was hit

On the horizon though the white light of explosions was reflected off the low cloud  many miles away

The government headquarters in the Baltic republic of Estonia has been barricaded in an attempt to prevent possible action by the Soviet military 

In the Latvian capital Riga key buildings have been blocked off since the beginning of the week  because of the conflict between the Soviet leadership and the pro-independence republics

The Latvian Prime Minister has accused the Soviet Interior Ministry troops in the republic of acting as a bandit force in the pay of the local Communist Party 

From Riga here 's the B B C 's correspondent Tim Hewell 

Estonia has until now been the calmest of the three Baltic republics 

But with a coordinating committee of pro-Moscow organisations  now calling for the dissolution of parliament  the authorities believe the threat of a military intervention similar to that in Lithuania has become too real to ignore 

They say an illegal radio station  apparently broadcasting from inside a military base  is issuing regular appeals for the overthrow of the government 

Meanwhile in Latvia the military authorities make no secret of their political preferences 

General Vladimir Serafanov of the Baltic command told a press conference in Riga  that servicemen sympathise more with the self-proclaimed Committee of National Salvation than with the elected Latvian government 

Eastern Airlines one of the biggest American carriers is going out of business

The company began grounding its planes last night

The airline had been in financial trouble for some time as the B B C 's North America business correspondent Richard Quest reports

Eastern Airlines has been operating under the supervision of the courts after a crippling strike forced the carrier into bankruptcy in nineteen eighty-nine 

Since then the sixty-two-year-old airline has tried to rebuild its business  but in the end the sheer weight of one billion dollars in debt coupled with rising fuel prices meant Eastern simply ran out of cash 

Eastern will now park its a hundred and sixty planes and suspend its eight hundred flights a day

It 's told its eighteen thousand employees not to report for work 

Although one U S airline has already said it will honour Eastern 's tickets on a standby basis  it 's not immediately clear what will happen to any stranded passengers 

At home Hertfordshire County Council says twenty teaching jobs will be cut in order to save over four hundred and fifty thousand pounds 

The Council is making the savings to finance school budgets and to pay for the National Curriculum

This report from Sarah Tomkys

The new County Education Officer Heather Dukenny maintains there 's been a minimal reduction in the budget which was necessary to meet the requirements of the County Council and she says there 's now a chance to re-allocate money to areas that badly need it

There are some things on which we 'll be spending more money next year  although we 've had to to reduce other areas in order to make that possible

However the Labour spokesperson for education on the County Council Eiral McNally says the authority can ill afford to make the cuts when training levels for young people in this country are so poor

She says she 'll be fighting the measures all the way and hopes some Conservatives will join her

Well I do think that there are members of the Conservative group who realise that their educational responsibilities

The Tory leadership on the whole are  panicking because of the poll tax

It 's not yet known where the jobs will be cut

Anglian Water is going to increase its water services charges by more than fifteen per cent in the coming year

The company says the level of increase reflects the cost of financing the first instalment of their four billion pound development plan

This report from Paula McCann

That 's the news

A look again at the main story this morning

Iraq has launched its second missile attack on Israel 

The Israeli Health Minister says it 's now almost inevitable that his country will retaliate 

There 's been intensive bombing in Baghdad overnight 

And British pilots have been speaking of their part in Operation Desert Storm

B B C Radio Bedfordshire News

It 's eleven minutes past eight

In the Gulf Iraq has launched another missile against Tel Aviv 

It came after the Israeli people had spent a sleepless night responding to a number of air raid warnings 

There have been a number of casualties but there are no reports of anybody being killed 

For the latest information here 's Alex Brodie in Jerusalem

The second missile attack on Israel came after a night of false alarms during which the population had donned gas masks and taken refuge in sealed rooms three times 

The real attack came at about seven fifteen in the morning 

The army will only confirm that missiles have fallen in Israel

So as not to aid the Iraqis they will not say where they 've fallen or how many

However they say all the missiles were carrying conventional warheads

It was not a chemical attack 

And initial reports of casualties speak of only ten lightly injured

One minute after the sirens sounded a witness heard two explosions north-west of Jerusalem  and that could be in the Israeli-occupied West Bank

The first official comment from the Israeli government on the likely response to this second attack has come from the country 's Deputy Foreign Minister Mr Jehoo 

He said that the Israelis did not want to become part of the war  but they had to do what was necessary to protect their country

The British armed forces minister Archy Hamilton  said that he had the greatest possible sympathy with the Israelis following what he described as completely random attacks 

But he said that retaliation would be embarrassing to the alliance

Mr Hamilton said that the Israelis ' objective  was to protect their own country

And the way that that will be done of course is finding  these mobile Scud launchers  and taking them out

And I really do believe that we are doing everything possible uhm to actually do that and to achieve that military objective

And I have certain doubts in my mind as to whether the Israelis could actually add to that military objective

I don't think that by sending in  Israeli aircraft that that we could do the job better 

Iraq 's ambassador to Paris Dr  has given his explanation as to why Iraq has launched missiles against Israel

The ambassador said the allied bombardment was causing civilian casualties 

But he said that Iraq had fought a war for eight years against Iran and it could withstand the allied attacks

And President Bush who 's spending the weekend at Camp David was woken up to be told the news of the attack on Tel Aviv

From Washington here 's Jeremy Harris

It 's thought that most of the Iraqi airfields have now been destroyed but the Scud missile launchers  are proving a problem

There have been reports of considerable retaliatory fire

The B B C 's Defence correspondent Mark Laity now reports from Dahrain

For the allied air forces it 's been another night of intense activity including attacks on any mobile Scud ballistic missile sites which are discovered 

However while they 're a very high priority only a small proportion of the total missions being flown are devoted to the hunt for them

The rest of the aircraft are still hitting targets according to the carefully worked out plan for Operation Desert Storm 

Now with daylight other aircraft unable to operate at night will have started their first missions

and there 's a powerful air assault going on against Iraqi army targets in the Kuwait area 

Allied commanders are pleased with progress

but this process will have to go on for a considerable time to dismantle a military machine the size of Iraq 's

And news just in

According to the B B C 's John Simpson who is in Baghdad  all journalists are being asked to leave Iraq

We 'll have more details on that shortly 

Meanwhile a senior Saudi military spokesman has said that Iraq 's chemical weapons ' capacity has been severely damaged

Even from the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh Jonathan Birchall now reports

They were wearing ski-masks and dark clothing and are thought to have escaped in a red car

Two of the customers twenty-three-year-old David Brindle and forty-seven-year-old Stanley Silk both from Walworth died at King 's College Hospital where one of the injured is in intensive care

Two others are serious but stable at Guy 's and the fifth 's been discharged

A column of crack Iraqi tanks are heading for a confrontation with British troops

Fourteen thousand Iraqi soldiers have surrendered and the allies are poised to retake Kuwait City

First the latest on the train situation in London

British Rail closed all the mainline stations two hours ago

Liverpool St has just been reopened but apart from that there are no trains into central London

Capital 's Caroline Atkinson is at Euston Station

A week after the I R A killed one man by bombing Victoria Station security alerts have shut all British Rail mainline terminals in the capital this morning

Thousands of commuters have been evacuated from platforms as the police launch a full-scale search

As a result all underground stations with connections to British Rail are also shut

At this stage there 's no word on how long they 'll stay closed

Caroline Atkinson Capital Reports at Euston Station

In the Gulf a column of crack Iraqi tanks are heading for a confrontation with British troops

The Republican Guard are moving towards the First Armoured Division

With the latest from the Gulf Peter Murphy

Up till now most of Iraq 's elite Republican Guard has stayed dug in in the south of the country

They 're the best trained and equipped of Saddam Hussein 's forces and allied commanders have always warned they 'll be tough opposition

With British French and American troops all heading towards their positions some at least are coming out to fight

A convoy of eighty or more tanks has been spotted by allied pilots and it 's reported to be moving south towards coalition forces

In the first twenty-four hours of the ground offensive the biggest problem was dealing with fourteen thousand prisoners of war

In the next twenty-four hours the real battle for Kuwait could be under way

Allied commanders say their casualties have been remarkably light

But some troops have been wounded and there are reports of a number of deaths

Iraqi defences still pose a danger to advancing allied troops

One column hit mines with an armoured division being blown up

All the soldiers inside survived but one of them says they were very badly shaken up

U S marines are poised to retake Kuwait City

Some reports say that battle could be underway by lunchtime

Military experts are warning the allies may face the elite Republican Guard there as well

Pentagon officials say we shouldn't assume the land battle will continue with so few casualties

Some of the heaviest fighting is expected later today

And officials say the battle could take a number of weeks

But the former European Commander of Allied Forces General Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley is confident the war will be short

If there is a continued engagement with the Republican Guard at some stage it could be drawn out

But I will go out on a limb now and say it isn't going to be months

it isn't going to be many weeks

I believe it is a matter of days

U S Secretary of State James Baker says the American peace offer is still on the table

Mr Baker said Saddam Hussein can end the fighting at any time by agreeing to leave Kuwait unconditionally

But he 's admitting America will be unhappy if he stays in power

And to repeat the news about the trains

All London 's mainline stations are still closed except Liverpool St which has been reopened

Tubes and trains are working there but there are no trains going into anywhere else in central London and there are no tubes stopping at those stations either

As soon as there 's any change we 'll let you know

American military officials say it 's not true that they blundered and killed hundreds of civilians in Baghdad

The Iraqis say up to six hundred people died when American missiles hit an air raid shelter in a residential area

Tonight Defence Secretary Dick Cheney admitted the target was hit deliberately but he says it was a military bunker being used as one of Saddam Hussein 's command centres

Mr Cheney says two bombs were dropped on it and they hit with great precision

And he says if civilians did die he 's sorry





Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown says that civilian deaths are regrettable but he says it would be wrong to condemn the U S military commanders for what appears to have been an error

It is not as some of us have perhaps more comfortably believed a transcontinental video game in which nobody gets hurt

This was clearly a mistake

It 's not part of the policy

And these mistakes happen in war

Of course if there are lessons to be learnt we should be learning them

But it would be wrong for politicians to second-guess the military who are taking the tough decisions to win this war from four thousand miles away

German police say the American Embassy in Bonn has been fired on by unknown attackers

It 's not clear if there 's a Gulf connection

Former Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley has called for further cuts in interest rates on top of today 's half a per cent reduction

The move came just hours after a group of leading economists wrote to The Times demanding a relaxation of the anti-inflation strategy

Mr Ridley told the Commons they should pen more letters

Maybe it is that uh if six of the best economists write to The Times we get a half per cent off the interest rate 

in which case I will encourage those six economists to write again on another three days

I should think three or four more letters like that would get us about uh where we should probably be

In her traditional speech at the State Opening the Queen said the government proposed to introduce fifteen new bills

That 's fewer than in any session since Mrs Thatcher came to power eleven years ago

Five of the bills are aimed at improving efficiency and safety of transport

Other major legislation will concern sentencing policy in the courts and action against the misuse and trafficking of drugs in what the Government calls its continuing fight against crime while there 'll also be a bill to try to improve the enforcement of child maintenance orders as part of the policy to strengthen family responsibility

The Queen also outlined the government 's commitment to free Britons trapped in Iraq 

My government will maintain their efforts to secure the release of all Britons held hostage or detained  in Kuwait Iraq Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East 

My government will continue to work for long-term peace in the Middle East  including a settlement of the Palestinian problem

A man has been arrested after firing two shots only two hundred yards away from President Gorbachev in Red Square

The President was with other Soviet leaders reviewing the Revolution Day march-past

There 's no indication as to whether the shots were aimed at the Soviet leader

Kevin Connolly reports

The Revolution Day parade was drawing to a close when a man in the crowd lining Red Square fired two shots

They were heard clearly on the far side of the square

The Soviet police have mounted a high-profile security operation in an attempt to reduce the risk that the parade might be disrupted by radical demonstrators

A group of officers near the man less than two hundred yards from the reviewing stand immediately arrested him and dragged him away 

Security officials have given no further details

And for the moment it 's not clear whether the shooting amounts to an attempt to assassinate the Soviet leader

Two people have been found dead on the M Twenty-Five in Hertfordshire

The jury has retired to consider its verdict in the Terry Marsh trial

The former world boxing champion is accused of trying to kill his ex-manager Frank Warren who was shot in east London last year

From the Old Bailey Matt Peacock reports

The Crown 's case against Mr Marsh is that the boxer had an overwhelming motive to carry out the crime as he sank into a sea of financial problems 

The defence though point to the lack of scientific evidence against Mr Marsh as being good reason to find the boxer not guilty 

In his summing up yesterday the judge Mr Justice Fennell Q C warned the jury not to treat the case as a whodunnit

Their task was to decide whether Mr Marsh was guilty or not rather than guess at who carried out the crime

Thousands of military reservists have been called up in the United States

The American Secretary of State says the Gulf crisis is entering a new phase

Lord Carrington tells us he believes war is now inevitable

The Prime Minister has been seeing senior advisers to discuss the repercussions of Sir Geoffrey Howe 's resignation

Lord Hailsham and a leading Tory backbencher tell us what they believe is the state of their party 's leadership and the chances of a contest for it

The Appeal Court has increased the sentence on a driver who killed a teenager while nearly three times over the limit 

Also tonight where will the Sky B S B merger leave British satellite broadcasting 

And what seems like the certain collapse of India 's government

That 's after tonight 's news bulletin which is read by Andrew Crawford 

The United States is preparing to mobilise major combat units from the reserves to send to the Gulf

They are expected to be part of a contingent of up to one hundred thousand which the administration is planning to add to its larger force already in position

From Washington here 's our correspondent David MacNeill

The Pentagon has called up more than thirty thousand reservists since the crisis began but most of them have been support units doctors cargo handlers mechanics

Now it 's about to mobilise major combat units to send to the Gulf

Last month the Defence Secretary Mr Cheney said it was conceivable that a further one hundred thousand American soldiers could be sent to the region and it 's believed that the reserve units would be part of that additional force

Pentagon officials say no final decision has been reached on which units are to be sent  or how many reservists are to be called up

The first combat units from the reserves could be sent early next year  after they 've undergone intensive training exercises including desert warfare techniques

The American Secretary of State Mr James Baker who 's on a tour of Middle Eastern and European countries has been told by the deposed Emir of Kuwait that America and the Allies should force the Iraqis out of his country as soon as possible

Mr Baker speaking later to reporters in Saudi Arabia  explained how he thought the Gulf situation would be settled

The Iraqis are claiming that war planes based in Saudi Arabia have violated their airspace for the second time in twenty-four hours

A foreign ministry spokesman said four unidentified aircraft have been involved in the incident 

An emergency meeting of European Community foreign ministers has been held in Rome tonight to discuss how to prevent private initiatives to secure the release of hostages from Iraq

Eight days ago the heads of government agreed that such moves should be discouraged 

but shortly afterwards the former West German Chancellor Mr Willie Brandt announced that he was going to Iraq arousing strong objections from several E C countries 

Ten wives of British hostages held in Iraq have said they intend to fly to Baghdad later this week to ask President Saddam Hussein to free their husbands

The women say they 'll be paying their own way to Baghdad  and have organised the trip with the cooperation of the Iraqi Embassy in London 

The Prime Minister is tonight in Geneva where she is attending a conference on global warming

She flew there after spending much of the day consulting senior colleagues about the impact of the resignation of Sir Geoffrey Howe and the personal criticism of her by Mr Michael Heseltine

Among those she spoke to were Lord Whitelaw the Party Chairman Mr Kenneth Baker and the Chief Whip Mr Timothy Renton 

Our political correspondent Robert Orchard assesses Mrs Thatcher 's position and the mood of her party

Mrs Thatcher 's advisers say

she 's determined not to be knocked off course by the current Tory turmoil

and her nerve may be steadied after advice today from her former right hand man Lord Whitelaw  who joined the Prime Minister her Party Chairman and her Chief Whip for lunch

Afterwards Lord Whitelaw played down talk of the crisis for Mrs Thatcher

but the Prime Minister will now know bluntly that many M Ps are worried  even if most still oppose a leadership challenge 

And the signs are that dissident backbenchers will still seek to mount a challenge with Mr Heseltine waiting in the wings if the stalking horse gathered enough support

The Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd would then be under strong pressure to oppose Mr Heseltine if the Prime Minister withdrew but he was insisting in Glasgow today that he still thought a leadership challenge unlikely

Mr Hurd was in Glasgow to address the Annual Conference of the C B I

His principal theme was Britain 's place in Europe and he argued that it was possible to protect our interests without protesting about threats to national sovereignty

He told his audience that a common currency could evolve into a single currency but only as a result of the choice of governments and peoples and not by imposition 

Agriculture and trade ministers of the E C countries are engaged in their eighth attempt to break their deadlock over cutting farm subsidies

They 've been under severe pressure to reach a deal so that a new international agreement on liberalizing world trade can be concluded next month 

The French and the Germans have been resisting proposals from the E C Commission for a thirty per cent cut in subsidies which itself is far smaller than the seventy-five per cent reduction demanded by the United States

Tonight in Brussels the E C Commission put forward new suggestions offering assurances on compensation for affected farmers

Britain 's minister Mr John Gummer said he was hopeful that his German counterpart made no comment 

The Court of Appeal is to seek information from the Police Complaints Authority which might help determine whether a pattern of corruption exists in cases involving the now disbanded West Midlands Serious Crime Squad

The Lord Chief Justice Lord Lane ordered the enquiries during a case in which a man serving fourteen years for armed robbery is appealing against conviction

His counsel argued that West Midlands detectives fabricated his confession

Our home affairs correspondent says the decision was unexpected and could have a profound impact on up to fifteen other cases involving allegations against the squad 

In another ruling the Appeal Court has increased the prison sentence imposed on a drunken driver who killed a seventeen-year-old girl when he was nearly three times over the legal alcohol limit

Lord Lane sitting with two other judges ruled that eight months in prison and two years ' disqualification was too lenient and he increased the sentence on Roy Lambert a hotelier from Cullenton in Devon to two years 

Mr Les Crewes whose daughter Joanne died when Lambert 's Daimler crashed into a sports car last May said he had no sympathy for the man behind the wheel

The co-founder of the campaign against drink and driving Mr John Knight said he hoped it would lead to tougher sentences in the future

A survey by six teachers ' unions suggests that staff vacancies at schools in England and Wales have increased by twenty-five per cent since last year

The unions say there are ten thousand unfilled posts with primary schools and language departments worst affected

The figures have been described as alarmist by the new Education Secretary Mr Kenneth Clarke

He said the unions had included vacancies covered by temporary arrangements

The true number of vacant posts was one thousand four hundred 

A clear-up operation is under way in Pembroke Dock in Dyffed after a barge carrying fuel overturned spilling a hundred tons of oil some of which has washed up on beaches five miles from the Milford Haven estuary

The firm has launched a full investigation

Andrew Crawford

Today the Pentagon as you as you heard I 'm sorry said it would call up tens of thousands of American reservists for possible service in the Gulf

And officials indicated that a hundred thousand or even more extra U S troops could well be sent to join the vast expeditionary force that 's already there

This comes just a day before Americans go to the polls in their mid-term congressional elections

But it also comes as the U S Secretary of State James Baker is himself in the Gulf finding out just how much support there is in the Arab world for military action to end the crisis

Now how much is this all part of the general psychological pressure being put on Saddam Hussein and the attempts to convince him that he has no way out except to withdraw from Kuwait

Or is it yet another step in what President Mitterrand has called in classic Gallic style the logic of war

Today I talked to the former Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington who subsequently sat at the centre of the West defensive alliance as Secretary General of NATO

Does he accept that logic that there is now bound to be war

Lord Carrington 

Well if the Gulf war is approaching it does so at a most inconvenient time in British politics centred as they are at the moment on the now linked questions of European unity and Mrs Thatcher 's leadership

Sir Geoffrey Howe 's resignation letter was not exactly a manifesto against the Prime Minister but its four pages certainly laid down some explicit differences with her

Michael Heseltine 's constituency letter published on Saturday came nearer to being a leadership manifesto

And those with an ear for these things could say that Mr Douglas Hurd 's speech to the C B I yesterday was yet another statement of principles nearer to Sir Geoffrey Howe than to some of the Prime Minister 's more severe remarks about Europe in the House last week

Well tonight I talked to that elder statesman of Mrs Thatcher 's first two governments Lord Hailsham 

I suggested that the Conservative cabinet and the party in parliament had got themselves into a considerable mess over this whole European issue  and it was not just a matter of presentation

Lord Hailsham

Well then I spoke to one of the backbench conservative M Ps who 's something of a sceptic on the issue of European unity Richard Shepherd 

With these various and competing statements on European policy coming from senior party figures from Sir Geoffrey Howe Michael Heseltine and now the Foreign Secretary did Mr Shepherd feel that the Prime Minister herself had given conflicting messages to the House of Commons on Tuesday

The Conservative M P Richard Shepherd 

The announcement that British satellite broadcasting is to merge with Rupert Murdoch 's Sky Television came out of the blue last Friday to what is usually a gossipy industry

There 'd been no trace of a leak while many days of complicated negotiations were completed 

What these have produced is this

Instead of two services each with its own satellite broadcasting on no less than nine rival channels and both losing enormous amounts of money there will now after the coming rationalisation be just one service five channels 

Initially this would have to come from both of the satellites to accommodate subscribers who have already installed equipment but eventually this too would shrink with all transmissions being concentrated on Sky 's Astra satellite 

Today the Independent Broadcasting Authority which licences B S B 's present service and the Office of Fair Trading they both announced investigations into the merger

There are important questions as to whether the new arrangements breach B S B 's licence from the I B A and also whether there are contraventions of the new Broadcasting Act

Martin McColl reports on where all this may leave the future of satellite broadcasting in Britain

Good evening

Squadron after squadron of Iraq 's best jets are flying to the safety of Iran

British military sources say more than a hundred Iraqi planes have already crossed the border but they don't know why

They 're said to be Saddam Hussein 's latest fighter bombers and transport aircraft which may have been carrying ground crews ammunition and spares

Iran has said again that the planes will be impounded until the end of the war

The defence ministry here has called it a desperate and cynical ploy to preserve his airforce

The allies say they 're approaching total air supremacy

They flew two thousand more sorties today

The R A F Tornadoes hit the Iraqi army fuel supplies

One allied plane was lost an American Marine Harrier

More Scud missile attacks tonight at Tel Aviv and Riyadh

Nobody 's hurt

Iraq 's given the U N figures of civilian casualties

three hundred and twenty dead and four hundred wounded so far it says

The Gulf oil-slick now covers three hundred and fifty square miles

But the Americans think their bombing stopped more oil being pumped out

And Britain 's been adding up the cost of war two billion pounds to deploy the forces a hundred million pounds of equipment lost or fired at the enemy and running costs of three and a half million pounds a day

Allied commanders still don't know why the best of Iraq 's airforce has flown to Iran

Washington says eighty Iraqi aircraft have sought sanctuary there sixty fighter bombers and twenty transports

But London says the total number of planes is more than a hundred

Both have been assured by Teheran that the jets will play no further part in the war

Allied commanders say their precision bombing raids have cut the flow of oil to the slick threatening the Gulf

but the Saudi government says

nearly two million tons of crude have already been pumped into the sea spreading over three hundred and fifty square miles

The slick is being carried south by the tidal flow of Gulf waters fifteen miles a day off the Saudi coast

As it drifts inshore it 'll threaten the desalination plants at  and then at  which provides eighty per cent of Riyadh 's fresh water and where the petrochemical industry could also be damaged

It 's thought the slick will get there within four days

The island state of Bahrain is trying to protect its desalination plant at Sitra from pollution which would reach there in ten days time

The slick has already drifted more than sixty miles from its source at 

Tomorrow it will be off  on the Saudi coast likely to swamp existing pollution from the spillage at  where storage tanks were damaged by earlier shelling

Here the Environment Secretary Michael Heseltine has said that Britain will play a full part in dealing with the spillage in the Gulf which he described as an abomination

He told M Ps that the R A F was airlifting ninety tons of equipment to help the international effort and more would be available if needed

Iraq has renewed its Scud missile attacks on Israel and Saudi Arabia tonight

A Scud launched at Israel apparently landed short of Tel Aviv

There are no reports of any casualties

Earlier the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir warned Saddam Hussein that if he launches a chemical attack on Israel he will put himself and his country in great danger

But Mr Shamir said Israel would act in coordination with the United States

The Scud attack against the Saudi capital Riyadh was the sixth since the war started

The single missile exploded in the air after being intercepted by American Patriot missiles

There are no reports of casualties 

President Bush and President Gorbachev have postponed next month 's summit in Moscow partly because of the Gulf war

Earlier President Bush said the United States is fighting a just war against Saddam Hussein 's regime

He said he didn't want to destroy Iraq

Here the Labour leader Neil Kinnock has tonight ordered his party 's transport spokesman John Prescott not to make any more public comments about the Gulf War

Mr Prescott who 's been critical of Labour 's Gulf policy has agreed only to transport matters

Our political correspondent Nicholas Jones reports

The Iraqis have allowed around nine hundred people mainly Jordanians to cross the border into Jordan

They 're the first large group to leave since the border at  was closed last Tuesday but relief organisations estimate that another thousand refugees are still stranded on the Iraqi side

Iraq is claiming tonight that there 's been a marked increase in the number of civilian casualties caused by the allied bombing raids

It says three hundred and twenty civilians have been killed and more than four hundred injured

The details have been put in writing to the U N

Our Foreign Affairs correspondent Brian Hanrahan reports

A British military spokesman in the Gulf has said that Britain 's Tornado warplanes are now attacking Iraq 's fuel supplies

Tornado crews have also been supporting Saudi bombing missions to knock out surface-to-air missile sites and airfields

The R A F has now flown a total of one thousand and fifty-three sorties

Allied ground troops are being hampered by bad weather as they move towards battle positions close to the border with Kuwait

Rain has turned parts of the Saudi desert into a quagmire

To Iraq itself now

And in Baghdad President Saddam Hussein made a radio broadcast announcing the start of the ground offensive

In a defiant speech full of florid language and references to the Koran  Saddam castigated President Bush King Fahad and the rest of the Allies and urged his soldiers to fight and show no mercy in order to achieve the victory of victories

The unyielding rhetoric which has continued to issue from Baghdad this morning has been echoed by Iraq 's representatives overseas including the country 's ambassador to Tokyo Dr Rashid Arisai

Iraq 's version of events so far came in a statement this morning broadcast on Baghdad Radio 

It confirmed that the land battle had begun at one o'clock in the morning our time and it claimed Iraq had been successful in blocking the Allied advance 

Our correspondent Tim Llewellyn who is in Baghdad compiled this report under Iraqi restrictions

In a detailed communiqu&eacute; the first since the ground war officially commenced last night  Iraq said

the enemy  the Allies to us  had launched an evil aggression against six Iraqi divisions Fourteen Eighteen Twenty-nine Eight Twenty-six and Forty-five and also against marine forces on Filacca Island which is about forty miles east of Kuwait City in the Gulf 

The Iraqis said they had held off all of those attacks and were still in control of the island 

They said the Allies had attacked outer perimeter defences inside Kuwait and positions inside those peripheries 

The enemy they said were contained

they were wading in their own blood and the situation generally was the best that could be imagined 

The Iraqis also said that Egyptian forces were taking part in the ground attack against Iraqis 

A regrettable and shameful act said a spokesman Arabs fighting side by side with foreigners against a fellow Arab nation 

The mood here in Baghdad is still one of subdued caution  with many people feeling they 've been forced unnecessarily into a dreadful war whose consequences are unknown 

They feel  rightly or wrongly that the United States pushed them to this stage  setting impossible peace conditions 

And President Saddam Hussein 's rallying speech this morning on Baghdad Radio was aimed at that feeling  knowing that all Iraqis are aware that there 's nothing left to do now but fight and survive the best they can 

Now reaction to the start of the ground war here at home

Up and down the country Sunday morning worshippers have been praying for the safety of those involved in the war

The mood was perhaps summed up by the Very Reverend Peter Berry Archdeacon of Aston who was speaking at Saint Philip 's Cathedral in Birmingham

And what of British political reaction to the start of the ground war

The Labour leader Neil Kinnock has been in Westminster this morning and he gave his reaction to our political correspondent Stephen Richards

The reaction I think like everyone else is to hope that it 's a very quick conflict although there can't be any certainty about that and to think of our forces particularly and coal coalition forces in general and hope that they can come uh as safe home as possible with the minimum amount of casualties

Uhm that 's the only way in which to regard what I think has been understood to be ultimately an inevitable  development in the course of this crisis

You say inevitable

But all day yesterday there were reports that uh Iraq were willing to accept the Soviet peace initiative if not the Washington ultimatum

D' you think more time should have been given to explore that possibility before launching the land war

I think it could be said at any stage that more time and more efforts to find new developments upon the variety of peace plans put forward uh could have been used

What we do know however is that even as Taliq Aziz was engaging in negotiations in Moscow and even as President Gorbachev was to his great credit striving to provide a way in which this crisis could be resolved without further conflict  Saddam Hussein was sending in Scuds uh

he was igniting the Kuwaiti oilfields and according to all reports uh he was uh allowing his troops or ordering his troops  uh to exterminate that 's the only word for it even more Kuwaiti civilians

And in those circumstances it 's very difficult to see how there could have been a completely secure basis  uh for resolving this crisis without some further development of the conflict at some stage

And uh one would like as indeed everybody would like there to have been another way out of it

I think that Saddam Hussein virtually blocked off all the other means of resolving it

At the start of the conflict you said

more time should have been given to sanctions

but you 're not now saying that more time should have been given to pursue those diplomatic initiatives

I think throughout that the main argument for first of all not resorting to war and then secondly of conducting the war in a way that would induce the greatest possible prospect  uh of the earliest possible peaceful settlement has been to do with trying to ensure a post-crisis stability that would be enduring

And uh I think that a lot of Saddam Hussein 's strategy has been a deliberate contrivance against that outcome

So it 's made the uh choices very constricted and made the development of a peace strategy extremely difficult 

And we could argue forever about uh the length of time that should have been permitted for this alternative or that alternative

and I can sincerely say that I think that there was a very good argument of trying for longer

That 's the argument I 've put before

But the fact remains we have been faced since the middle of January with war

We are faced now with a ground conflict

And the best thing that can be secured now is the swiftest possible end to that conflict with the minimum number of casualties  and then the most rapid and strongest move to political and diplomatic efforts to achieve a durable peace and stability in the region

The Law Commission 's proposals on divorce reform have been published  including the idea of a one-year cooling off period 

The Lord Chancellor Lord Mackay tells us he welcomes the proposals  but voluntary conciliation services say they need more money  to make them work

Shops and garages have been given the go-ahead to charge higher prices to customers using credit cards than to those offering cash 

The Consumer Association fears it will lead to profiteering but the Consumer and Corporate Affairs Minister argues that it will be good for the customer 

British and Irish nurses at a Baghdad hospital have stopped work in protest at not being allowed to leave Iraq 

And later in the programme should the families of hostages take up Saddam Hussein 's offer to go to Iraq at Christmas 

The wife of a hostage says yes 

A senior Conservative tells us it would give the wrong message to Saddam Hussein

The official law reforming body in England and Wales the Law Commission  has published its long-awaited proposals for a radical reform of the divorce law 

As expected it 's recommending a minimum twelve-month period of reflection before divorces are granted  and the abolition of the fault grounds for divorce  such as adultery and unreasonable behaviour 

It also suggests that a court should have the power to prevent divorce in cases of extreme hardship 

Our legal affairs correspondent Jane Peel  has been studying the proposals

The Law Commission recommends that in future anyone who 's not in a violent relationship will have to prove the marriage has broken down  by spending at least a year considering and reflecting on the decision to split up 

During that period the couple would have to seek agreement on the future of their children  money and property 

The courts would encourage but not force them to visit counselling or conciliation services 

If there 's no agreement after a year the courts may postpone the divorce  or in rare cases where it would cause grave financial hardship  refuse to grant it at all 

The report which is accompanied by a draft bill says these new proposals will make divorce fairer and less humiliating  for husbands wives and their children

The Treasury and the Bank of England have acted to quash speculation about another imminent cut in interest rates 

In an unusual move  they 've both issued statements saying the cost of borrowing will stay at fourteen per cent until it 's safe to make a reduction 

Speculation about another cut in interest rates has been fuelled by the C B I report on Tuesday  which said industry was in the middle of a recession 

The government has given the go-ahead for shops and garages to charge higher prices to customers using credit cards  than to those offering cash 

The Corporate Affairs Minister Mr John Redwood says the new arrangements will be in place by March next year 

Our business affairs correspondent Peter Smith reports

This decision has been inevitable since the credit card company Visa failed in the High Court to block the Government from going along with a recommendation from the Monopolies Commission 

It 'll mean traders will be able to offer a discount for cash  or alternatively charge extra to customers using credit cards 

Until now the card companies have been able to impose a rule preventing shops from discriminating between sales in cash or plastic  forcing them to charge all the same price

It 's likely to make little difference to the big retail chains  who can negotiate cheap terms with the card companies 

But small shops who have to pay up to five per cent on credit card sales  are likely to introduce two-tier pricing and many petrol stations may do the same

The Foreign Office has rejected a call by the families of British hostages in Lebanon  for the restoration of diplomatic ties with Syria 

Relations were broken off by Britain four years ago after the Syrians were accused of being involved in a terrorist plot to blow up an Israeli airliner at Heathrow Airport 

This morning the Archbishop of Canterbury 's spokesman Mr John Little  said the Government should start talking to Syria as a move towards freeing the hostages 

However a Foreign Office spokesman said that while Britain wanted to normalize relations  serious obstacles still stood in the way 

Staff at an Irish-run hospital in the Iraqi capital Baghdad have stopped work  in protest over the continuing refusal of the authorities to allow them to leave 

Among them are the only foreign women still held in Iraq against their will 

From Baghdad Bob Simpson reports

Between fifteen and twenty nurses and junior doctors whose formal work contracts have expired have stopped working voluntarily at the  hospital in Baghdad 

It 's run by a subsidiary of Aer Lingus the Irish state airline under an agreement with the Iraqi ministry of health

The protesters who come from Ireland and the United Kingdom  say the company isn't doing enough to get them out of the country 

And the women in particular are aggrieved that they are the only foreign women not to be allowed to leave by the Iraqi government

A spokesman for the hospital management company in Baghdad  insisted that they were doing all they could to get their employees out of the country

There has been little reaction among expatriates here to the Iraqis ' offer to let hostages ' relatives into the country at Christmas 

It 's being dismissed as a cynical public relations exercise

Customs officers are questioning twenty-three Irishmen in connection with an alleged two million pound V A T fraud which it 's expected could be linked to the I R A 

The men were arrested yesterday in raids on more than a hundred pubs clubs and cafes in London Leeds and Norwich 

David Willis reports

For two years customs officers have been working on an undercover investigation code named Operation Jade 

At the centre of their enquiries has been an alleged V A T fraud involving gaming machines at pubs clubs and cafes throughout the U K 

There they found slot machines which as well as being used normally could be switched to pay out sums up to a thousand pounds 

Such machines are usually only found in casinos 

Today customs sources confirmed that much of the money raised from these machines was almost certainly passed on to the I R A 

They 've seized documents and more than two hundred gaming machines  and say they expect to charge some of the men being held  later today

A Scotland Yard disciplinary tribunal has recommended that seven police officers  who while off duty were involved in an attack on a man in a pub three years ago should be sacked 

The officers who have all been suspended since the attack  were found guilty of discreditable conduct

In the incident Mr Gary Stretch had his ear partially severed and has since had to give up work 

The tribunal 's report will now be considered by the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Peter Imbert

If he approves the recommendation  it will be one of the most severe disciplinary measures carried out in the metropolitan force in recent years

The Law Commission 's long-awaited report on divorce recommends a simpler system and a system designed to cut down the bitterness and the trauma when a couple decide that they must part 

Its intention is partly to minimise some of the damage and of course that damage is often done to the children of a broken marriage

It 's a human rather than a political problem 

So David Robertson got the recollections of one such child Rachel Pearce who 's now seventeen and whose parents divorced when she was eight

A story which could no doubt be told by many children 

So what has the Law Commission tried to do 

I asked Professor Brenda Hoggett who 's one of the authors of the report

It 's taking us we hope towards a better and more honest and more humane system of divorce law

Without making divorce necessarily easier in all cases

No i it would not make divorce generally either easier or more difficult 

It would make it quite different and in our view better

But the key it seems to me is that  the the grounds for divorce are going to be simplified

That is right 

The present ground for divorce is that the marriage has irretrievably broken down 

But that can be proved in one of five ways 

three of which involve proving fault  which in practice is quite easy to do because the other person can't really challenge it

And in any case it does nothing to help the parties ' relationship or to mend the marriage 

We are proposing that in the future  irretrievable breakdown should be shown by the lapse of a minimum period of twelve months  during which the couple would be expected to consider what arrangements should be made uh in the event of their actually being divorced

So there are two uh points which spring from that

One is that for example adultery as grounds for divorce goes

That is right

And secondly there is a lot of emphasis on the whole question of conciliation after it has been agreed by the parties that they want to part 

There is an emphasis on sorting out the practical consequences  what it will mean for the couple their children their home their property their money what they 're all going to live on  before rather than after they get divorced 

Unfortunately at present a lot of that is sorted out afterwards not before 

One of our principal concerns was to minimise the harm that the children can suffer both while the divorce is happening and in the future 

They suffer  very much if they lose touch with one of their parents 

uh

and they need to feel that both of their parents are still involved in their upbringing if at all possible

So some of the quickie divorces so-called that now happen would actually be stretched out by the procedures that you 're advocating

That 's right 

Uh

but of course during that stretching out it is hoped that the arrangements that will be necessary if it happens will have taken place whereas at present you can get a quickie divorce and then fight about the consequences for years afterwards

Professor Brenda Hoggett one of the authors of the Law Commission report

Well the Lord Chancellor Lord Mackay of Clashfern will be responsible for introducing any divorce reform bill to Parliament 

He 'll be listening of course to the views of interested parties and M Ps before he drafts a bill 

but he has already welcomed the two main planks of the Law Commission 's proposals  the need for more conciliation for those who are contemplating divorce and the abolition of the requirement to cite adultery or unreasonable behaviour as grounds for divorce

He told our legal affairs correspondent Jane Peel why he supported the proposals

The Lord Chancellor

So what of the conciliators and the various organisations which offer such a service

Do they think they can continue  without more financial backing

I asked the conciliation director at the National Family Conciliation Council  Thelma Fisher

Thelma Fisher who 's the conciliation director of the National Family Conciliation Council 

The Foreign Office has reacted angrily to Saddam Hussein 's suggestion that hostages ' families may be welcome to make Christmas and New Year visits to their families in Iraq 

It 's seen by the government here and indeed in Washington as a propaganda ploy playing on the sentiments of the families

But it 's equally clear that some people may be anxious to take advantage of any offer that comes along 

I spoke this morning to Mrs Gillie Battersby whose husband Blue  was in Kuwait at the time of the invasion and who she now believes is being held at a military installation somewhere in Iraq 

She told me that she still feels as inclined to return there  now as she did last month when she undertook a visit on her own initiative  to see her husband

Margaret Thatcher is resigning as leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister 

Before leaving Number Ten to see the Queen she told her Cabinet  it 's a funny old world 

The Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd will now stand in the second ballot

The Chancellor John Major also enters the leadership fray for what they both call a friendly contest 

Michael Heseltine pays tribute to Mrs Thatcher 's remarkable premiership 

Labour 's leader Neil Kinnock calls the resignution resignation very good news and demands an immediate general election 

Good afternoon 

At seven thirty this morning it 's understood Margaret Thatcher made up her mind and at nine o'clock when senior ministers gathered around her at Number Ten she told them what she 'd do

She 'd remain Prime Minister only until Conservatives had elected a new party leader

She 'd already informed the Queen by telephone that she wouldn't contest the second ballot next Tuesday 

Mrs Thatcher said it was rather a funny old world when she 'd won three elections for the Conservatives

and she still believed she had the overwhelming support of Tories across the country

The reason for the Prime Minister 's resignation she said was to enable Cabinet colleagues to enter the ballot 

Soon after eleven came the news that two senior ministers Douglas Hurd and John Major had joined the race

Including Michael Heseltine there 'll now be three candidates for Mrs Thatcher 's job 

Our first report is from our political correspondent Lance Price who 's been in Downing Street all morning 

The first to hear of Mrs Thatcher 's decision was her parliamentary private secretary Peter Morrison

He arrived at Downing Street at seven thirty this morning shortly followed by John Wakeham who only yesterday was appointed her campaign manager 

By this time the Palace had been informed of her decision but as Cabinet ministers started arriving for their nine o'clock meeting it was clear that most were still in the dark

Mrs Thatcher saw most of her Cabinet individually last night

The majority told her that while they would continue to support her they didn't think she could win 

Many urged her to open the way for other members of the Cabinet to put themselves forward

She told them it was a funny old world

She 'd won three general elections had the overwhelming support of the party and the country and of a majority of M Ps  but her future was still in doubt 

Douglas Hurd was already known to want her to withdraw and as soon as the Cabinet was together she told them that that was her decision

She read out her prepared statement that she was going in the interests of party unity and to improve the prospects of a general election victory 

She thanked her colleagues for their support and said she hoped that one of their number would succeed her

As soon as the meeting broke up the party chairman gave his reaction

This is a typically brave and selfless decision by the Prime Minister

Uh

once again Margaret Thatcher has put her country 's and party 's interests before personal considerations

This will allow the Party to elect a new leader who will unite the Party and build upon her immense successes

If I could add just a personal note

I am very saddened indeed that our greatest peace-time Prime Minister has left Government

Uh she is an outstanding leader not only of our country and of the world

And I do not believe we will see her like again 

Flowers continued to arrive at Downing Street this morning

Whether in support or hasty commiseration wasn't clear

But one of her closest Cabinet allies expressed his personal disappointment

Cabinet ministers had stayed behind after their officials left to discuss who might stand

There was a clear desire that whatever else happened the Party must come together

The uncertainty about who would stand continued right up to the twelve o'clock deadline 

There was talk that Norman Tebbit was considering his position

But he decided against  leaving no candidate from the traditional right of the party in the field 

So when nominations closed just over an hour ago it was a three-horse race

Mr Heseltine will face the Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and the Chancellor Mr Major in the second ballot on Tuesday

And that raises the prospect of a third ballot a week today if no candidate gets an overall majority 

Mrs Thatcher left Downing Street for the Palace just after half past twelve having sent personal messages to President Bush President Gorbachev and other world leaders

She 's still Prime Minister ready to defend the Government at question time and in the no confidence debate this afternoon

But Mrs Thatcher will return to the Palace next week to surrender her seals of office and end her eleven and a half years as Her Majesty 's Prime Minister

Mr Hurd was proposed for the party leadership by the Environment Secretary Chris Patten and was seconded by Tom King the Defence Secretary

A short time ago he came out of the Foreign Office to announce his candidacy

He acknowledged that he 'll be in competition with his friend and strong colleague John Major but he had this to say about his own bid for the leadership

Prime Minister announced a very sad decision this morning

I believe the overriding need now is for the Conservative Party to find a leader  who can unite it  in handling present problems and in winning the next general election 

That 's the message coming in from Conservatives in all parts of the party all parts of the country

Division can spell disaster

I believe that I can do that and that is why I 'm putting my name forward

I can believe that I can unite the Party in handling present problems and in winning the next general election

Michael Heseltine 's first response after hearing the news of Mrs Thatcher 's withdrawal was to pay tribute to her leadership

He said she 'd made a remarkable contribution to Britain 's history

He was speaking at an acorn-planting ceremony and added that nothing could be more indicative of his attitude to the permanence of the Conservative Party 

Michael Heseltine heard the news of the Prime Minister 's resignation as he was driving to London Zoo for a long standing engagement to join school children planting acorns

He delayed his arrival for fifteen minutes to prepare his reaction 

May I  say at once that this brings to an end a quite remarkable premiership 

She has made a remarkable contribution to Britain 's history and has led this country with great distinction in the nineteen eighties 

The  resignation about which we 've just heard now opens the way for an election for the vacancy of leader of the Conservative Party which will enable others to come forward

I very much welcome that

I would expect my own name to be  still there as it has already been nominated

And we will then find a way of uniting the Conservative Party and of going on to win the next general election

As he left cutting short his visit he refused to answer any questions or give any hint as to how his campaign tactics will have to change now that it 's no longer a straight fight between between himself and Mrs Thatcher

But he kept his other scheduled appointment of the morning despite the turmoil within the Tory Party and attended the memorial service at Westminster Abbey for Lady Hume 

Mrs Thatcher had decided not to go to the service

She was represented by her husband Denis and her parliamentary private secretary Peter Morrison the first of her advisers to hear of her resignation decision 

The leading figures of Mrs Thatcher 's eleven and a half years in power were there Lord Whitelaw Kenneth Baker and Sir Geoffrey Howe whose resignation and speech in the Commons led Mr Heseltine to challenge for the leadership and which ultimately forced her to stand down

The news of Mrs Thatcher 's decision spread rapidly around Westminster

It aroused surprise among most M Ps and some sadness among many

Longer serving Conservative backbenchers mourn the end of an era while others pay tribute to the woman who 'd led them for their entire political career 

And the headlines this week 

Mrs Thatcher 's surprise decision to go shocked many Conservatives caused delight to the opposition  and brought tributes to her from both sides 

At a final international conference she signed documents that officially ended the Cold War 

And the plight of a community of whales no longer threatened by the harpoon gun  but being wiped out by the careless pollution of their sea 







Michael Heseltine today at his Oxfordshire mansion with the family has planned this campaign with meticulous precision 

With his opponents suggesting that they were starting to squeeze his vote  Mr Heseltine 's camp have disclosed the big-name backers 

They say Nigel Lawson who resigned as chancellor last year  and Sir Geoffrey Howe whose resignation speech is seen by many  as the spark for the whole contest  are now going to rally to the Heseltine banner 

Until now both men have studiously avoided saying who they 'd be supporting 

Mr Heseltine is buoyant

I 'm  more confident by the phone call 

Getting better and better

The only time the chancellor is normally seen walking in St James 's Park is on budget day  but with the leadership election only three days away a candidate has to use assiduously every photo opportunity at his disposal 

Mr Major 's campaign team believe their man is out in front and are confident they 're only a few steps away from number ten 

His campaign was boosted today with another cabinet endorsement  this time the social services secretary Tony Newton

I think he 's got the right combination of qualities to make him the best choice  for being the next Prime Minister and then for leading the party to win the next general election 

He 's got great ability

he 's got great determination and I think he 's got a very wide understanding of all sorts of people and issues

But Douglas Hurd was today able to announce Peter Brooke as another big-name backer for him 

Supporters say their man is running neck-and-neck with Michael Heseltine 

That seems to suggest though that they too acknowledge Mr Major has become the man to beat

But Douglas Hurd is still playing to win the battle for number ten 

Friends say it will be on the third ballot  and in a sideswipe at the other campaigns one aide said we 're not a Liberal Party committee rooms giving minute by minute body counts

One of the papers today said uh my campaign was a tortoise compared to a hare

You do need to remember who won that particular race

And opinion polls to be published in some of tomorrow 's papers seem to suggest that among the electorate at large  Michael Heseltine has the greatest voter appeal  but Labour say they don't care who wins

Whoever emerges as Tory leader  the problems of the economy recession inflation mounting unemployment  deficits on our trade all those problems will still be there 

and once this uh shambles in the Tory party is resolved people will realise that nothing much has changed 

That 's why we are confident Labour can win

We believe there should be an election 

Let us put it to the people

For Mrs Thatcher though a final weekend above the shop 

Today suitcases arrived so that she could start to pack 

On Monday the removal men arrive

On Tuesday she could be gone  making way for a new occupant

The story which dominated the week was the one that dominated the last decade Mrs Thatcher  and it brought some of the most remarkable events that have been seen in British politics 

She 'd have won the first ballot for leader outright if two M Ps had voted the other way

Her first impulse was to fight on 

So was her second  but the tide of support and of history ebbed

Mrs Thatcher 's fight was staged as she attended the conference in Paris that ended the Cold War 

Leaders from thirty-four nations saw NATO and the Warsaw Pact sign a treaty for the biggest arms cut so far 

They also signed a charter for a new Europe of democracy prosperity and security

Britain is to send another fourteen thousand troops to the Gulf  bringing the British force to more than thirty thousand

The Defence Secretary Tom King said it was a message to Iraq that there is a military option 

President Bush spent the week meeting world leaders to discuss the next moves in the Gulf crisis

Simon Jones the four-year-old boy who 'd been missing for eight weeks was found safe and well 

He was found in a men 's hostel in Hemel Hempstead  just yards from home and from where he vanished 

Peter May who 's twenty-five and lives in the town was later charged with abduction and indecency

George Bush in his inauguration speech said A president is neither prince nor Pope 

It was his way of saying that his approach to the job was not going to be grandiose or imperious

But of course the American people who love British Royals perhaps more than the Britons do  rather want that kind of figure and in the main they don't mind paying for it 

At least they get to see some of what their money buys 

Get there early enough

and you can queue up and get a tour round the White House

Well bits of it anyway

Try doing that with Buckingham Palace 

But those Presidents who in the past have tried to behave like the common man  have actually paid for it

In eighteen twenty nine Andrew Jackson invited everyone back to his place for a drink after he was sworn in as President  and for his trouble was nearly smothered by drunken boisterous admirers

And Jimmy Carter followed the example of his predecessor Thomas Jefferson  who walked to his inauguration ceremony to emphasise the simplicity of republican government 

and look what happened to Jimmy Carter

Americans may say they 'd like the idea of a simple President leading a simple life without all the trappings and paraphernalia of a world leader but frankly that 's nonsense 

They want their President to have all the latest toys the multi-million pound Jumbo jet  the bomb- and bullet-proof limousines  everything the other world leaders have but more so  because this is America

Sure it costs a lot but that doesn't matter

Anyway that George Bush is a nice guy  and he was born rich so he is used to that sort of thing 

And whatever opulence and excess to tax payer is stumping up forward this President  it is still peanuts if you 'll pardon the expression Jimmy compared with the previous incumbent

The excesses of the Reagan years have been gone into at length elsewhere so you don't need me to repeat them 

But when George Bush took over America was slipping into a recession 

It just didn't look good to be living it up at tax payers ' expense and there 'd been criticism that the Reagan administration had been  insensitive to propriety to coin a coy phrase

So with George in the top seat things were going to be different

The buzz phrase in Washington became  ethical standards

The media intensified its scrutiny of public officials and the President obviously was above such scrutiny on the he costs a lot but he 's worth it basis and he does pay income tax

his tax returns made public every year and it 's heavily scrutinised 

And he has investments but they are in a blind trust while he remains in office 

However those close to the President found they did have to justify the amount they were costing the taxpayer and one  Mr Bush 's right hand man White House chief of staff John Sinunu was found to have been acting as if he was the president or even the vice president when it came to travel matters

Mr Sinunu was discovered to have been ordering up government aircraft to fly him to the dentist  or on skiing holidays or to political fund raising events for the Republican party 

He has now finally been persuaded to adopt a low profile on such matters  in order to save his job

But such reporting is by no means over as we saw with this item on C B S television news earlier this week

The explanation given was that the transportation secretary had to be completely familiar with the kind of conditions pilots encounter in their daily work

On that basis perhaps Mr Skinner will soon be learning how to drive buses lorries and trains at the taxpayers ' expense

Somehow I doubt it

Not as glamorous as executive jets 

But don't expect Sam Skinner to lose his job any more than John Sinunu did 

People in power expect and get perks and who pays 

We do 

That 's inside America

On paper President Gorbachev is not expensive to run  at least as his salary is concerned 

He earns less than the most successful pop stars and might be far better running a cooperative restaurant than a country

But there are plenty of overheads  not to mention behind backs and under foot

Security costs are high 

though compared with President Bush or John Major  they 're probably not astronomical either

For example there 're ten plane crews on constant standby rota ready to fly the Soviet leader anywhere in the world 

These men are highly paid and dedicated 

In a recent interview one of them declared it 's easier to become a cosmonaut than a pilot for a presidential plane

Security is much trickier and therefore more costly these days  because the population isn't kept under the same tight surveillance of yesteryear

The whole security system was changed when Gorbachev came to power 

The so-called ninth department of the K G B was shaken up 

For a start in the Brezhnev Andropov era everyone knew the places

the General Secretary lived on Katuluski Prospect  not far from the foreign compound

Routinely the roads were blocked off as the convoys of sleek black cars  crept majestically down the wide freeway almost straight to the Kremlin door 

That was the journey the leader took

Gorbachev apparently lived in a three storey house near the Kremlin in the Lenin Hills when he first came to power 

But as we now know from the photographs he has a stunning Dacha or country house some twenty minutes ' drive from the centre 

Routinely traffic is stopped as the Gorbachev convoy of four Zils roars by 

He changes the vehicle he rides in but there 's always one known as the hedgehog because it has so many aerials protruding from it 

Russian president Boris Yeltsin who 's been in more near misses than any other

Brezhnev loved fast cars and as the roads were always cleared this was no problem 

One militia man used to this blur of black metal on his beat one day decided to see just how fast the cars were going 

He raised his speed gun and was immediately shot dead

Although the Queen is regularly touted as the world 's richest woman  the Emperor of Japan is not to be seen on the list of the world 's richest men or people  at least not until a long way down

The big difference between Britain 's royal family and the imperial family of Japan is that the latter don't own any land 

If it did the Emperor would probably be the richest man in the world  because the two hundred acres the Imperial Palace and its grounds occupy in the centre of Tokyo must easily be the most valuable tract of undeveloped land in the world 

The land however belongs to the state 

Mind you the state 's very generous because in a city where rents are very high the Royal family gets this pad rent-free 

And the government thanks to the tax payers it represents of course coughs up a lot for various imperial ceremonies and functions 

Last year 's enthronement for example cost something like thirty-two million pounds 

And fifteen million pounds worth of ferro-concrete is currently being constructed to provide the Emperor and his wife with a new home 

At the moment they live in the house they were in when he was Crown Prince 

The building in which the previous emperor Hirohito lived  is used only for official engagements 

When the emperor 's younger son got married a year ago television was allowed in to see his new home 

It seemed to be rather like a three bedroom semi-detached but with obviously a lot of money spent on the interior design 

This couple receive about a hundred and sixty thousand pounds a year between them for their personal use 

One of the many reasons the heir to the throne is having trouble finding a bride is that his relatively austere lifestyle puts off the rich eligible women who know they 'll have much more fun away from the imperial family 

The members of the family lead a very different lifestyle from Britain 's royals 

They 're expected to do far less in terms of public engagements  and yet are much more restricted in what they can do and where they can go

Their lives are largely run by the mysterious men in the imperial household agency  which holds the family 's purse strings 

Prince Charles reportedly once made a comment about the Japanese royal family being nothing more than puppets and prisoners in their own country 

When Hirohito died his estate was estimated to be worth less than ten million pounds

Emperor Akihito inherited about four and a half million pounds from his father  but had to pay about two million of that in inheritance tax 

and under a new law the tax paid on it had to be displayed publicly 

When they heard about this imperialists were outraged saying it was a disgrace to the Emperor 

One protester locked himself in a room at the tax office dealing with the assessment  and fired a random shot before surrendering to police 

Because tax officials were wary of similar protests  they decided to display the tax assessment on a desk in a private conference room guarded by police instead of on a bulletin board as usual 

Theoretically this was still public because any member of the public could still request to see it 

But since the day of the display wasn't publicised no one did 

But the law was upheld so everyone was happy 

So if it 's not really worth trying to get born into the imperial family what about entering Japanese politics

Well this invigorating area you know is positively awash with cash and lucrative shareholdings as the sporadic financial scandals show 

And whereas Britain 's Prime Ministers generally wait until after they 've left office before they capitalise on their name and earn tidy sums giving speeches and opening supermarkets and the like  in Japan they can do it on the side while in office 

For the record the Prime Minister 's official salary currently stands at twenty-five million yen or about a hundred and ten thousand pounds 

Japanese firms would also save part of an employee 's salary for a two-part bonus to be paid in the summer and at the end of the year 

The government is no different

and somehow the powers that be have decided Prime Minister Kaifu 's summer bonus should be two million yen or about eight and a half thousand pounds

Germany did away with its monarchy in November nineteen eighteen 

Well it didn't so much abolish the Royal Court

rather the Kaiser and the princes stood down

and as their credibility was at an all-time low  there was little if any resistance 

It 's difficult to say whether the Germans would want them back

On the one hand it 's a modern country with an elected head of state  but at the same time the Germans crave for pageantry and glamour of royalty and one notices here that counts and countesses of territories lost at the end of the last century  still hold on to their titles

But it doesn't bring much only a title because Germany 's head of state is an elected official

There have been six federal presidents since the birth of the modern federal German state and none has been as popular as Richard von Weizs&aumlaut;cker the present president 

He took on the job back in nineteen eighty-four and was duly re-elected for a second five-year term in nineteen eighty-nine 

There 's even been talk of changing the constitution which allows only two terms as federal president so von Weizs&aumlaut;cker could remain in the top job

But he says he 's had enough

Ten years as the top man in the country is enough for anyone 

He 's elected by a special constitutional body made up of M Ps known as the federal convention

It comes together solely for the purpose of electing the president  and it 's parliament who decides how much money the presidential office receives

There 's a great deal of work to be done

The president accredits and receives ambassadors appoints and dismisses judges and can pardon convicted criminals 

He makes frequent trips abroad drumming up business for German firms and smoothing the feathers of Germany 's enemies 

But what has made Richard von Weizs&aumlaut;cker popular among Germans is his high moral standing  sort of the Vaclav Havel of Germany

So with such a popular man at the helm his budget goes through the Bundestag virtually on a nod 

It costs ten million pounds annually to keep his office and two palatial residences operating

and their remuneration for twenty-four hour a day devotion to the fatherland  one hundred and twenty thousand pounds a year 

That 's some ten thousand pounds a month  but with the modern German state comes the modern tax collector and even the president of high moral standing or not is not exempt from paying tax 

And there are few tax dodges and tax allowances for the man

After all he has few outgoings

Travel meals accommodation and security costs are all picked up by the state

Ships still ride the tides of the Thames

but most go no further today than the modern port of Tilbury near the Thames estuary in Essex 

Further upriver is desolation 

There 's been some revival in barge traffic with the rebuilding of the old docklands upriver

Sand and gravel 's towed on the floodtide to the Canary Wharf development on the Isle of Dogs 

A fifth of London 's rubbish goes downstream in barges to be buried in Essex 

But to those who knew the river in its heyday it 's dead 

It 's now once again a natural feature of London 's urban landscape 

The world renown of the Thames was always quite out of scale with its natural grandeur 

Compared with the Nile or the Amazon or the Mississippi it 's a mere sea creek 

It 's famous because in the Victorian era the greatest city in the world grew up on its banks 

The first London was just a colonial outpost of the Roman empire 

The Romans crossed the Channel landed in Kent and marched north to the river Thames 

They built a wooden bridge across it here just below modern London Bridge when the river was much wider lapping Lower Thames Street 

Roman Londinium had a thriving port but it didn't last 

When the Romans retreated in four hundred A D their port and their town disappeared 

The Saxons had a port upstream but the Thames tides carried no significant trade for five hundred years 

It was five hundred years after that in the Elizabethan era that the river took on a real economic importance for London and England 

The great natural force of the tides carried ships far inland on the flood and out on the ebb 

This linked London with growing industrial centres in other parts of the country 

Coastal shipping gave England an industrial lead 

Before good roads or railways landlocked European cities were left behind as London grew  overtaking Paris in size in seventeen fifty

Historian Robin Craig

The lorries of the river the most local of the ships in the coasting trade were the Thames sailing barges 

Their special spritsail rigging was designed so they could be worked by just two men 

The form of the Thames barge evolved in the early nineteenth century replacing an earlier more primitive kind of sailing vessel 

This kept down costs and made it a competitive form of transport well into the twentieth century 

One of the last surviving of the old barge skippers is Dan Wills from Gravesend 

Some of the larger barges were sea-going vessels like the Lady Daphne 

Though they seem quaint now the sailing barges had tremendous economic importance in the past 

No great city could grow without building materials food and fuel

On its tidal estuary linked to all other parts of Britain by the sea London began to take the lead 

Its most significant cargo when it began to emerge as a world city was coal 

Coal was first in great demand in the fifteenth century

It couldn't be carried efficiently overland 

London 's coal came down the East coast from Newcastle and was known as sea coal 

By the eighteenth century the trade in sea coal to London was the single most important employer of shipping 

Captain Cook learnt his seamanship on this route and his first explorer ship was a Whitby collier renamed The Endeavour 

A Whitby collier also gave its name to a Thames-side pub 

London 's dependence on sea-borne coal continued into the age of electricity 

The first power stations were built along the Thames so that river water could be used as a coolant 

This is Battersea power station under construction in the nineteen thirties its chimneys towering above the river 

Because power stations were built on the Thames the most efficient way of delivering the millions of tons of coal they devoured was by ship 

The men who manned the colliers were the unsung unglamorous heroes of the London river 

Kevin Greenwell a liner steward did a stint on the Thames coal boats 

Collier skipper Albert Dale 

The coal trade provided a great deal of work for Londoners

It was one of the most lucrative cargoes on the Thames 

Lighterman and tug skipper Bob Harris 

The coal trade and nearly all of the coasting trade has gone from the Thames 

All the power stations the gas works and the factories have closed down 

The ships that had carried a more adventurous and exotic trade and which brought great wealth to London are now museum pieces beached like the Cutty Sark on the shores of the capital 's history 

London was the centre of England 's foreign shipping

It was here that the great charter companies were established from the sixteenth century onwards 

Royalty with political power and the City with economic power gambled on the risky business of sending ships to the far corners of the world to bring back valuable goods 

London became the largest city in Europe in the days of the square-rigger 

Few now can remember life under sail 

Robert Williamson sailed from the West India Docks before nineteen fourteen 

The deep-sea sailing ships brought back goods which were stored in London 

By the nineteenth century it had become the warehouse of the world 

Its spices and other valuable cargoes from the empire were resold in Europe 

The Port of London was more than just a port

It was an emporium in which the world 's goods were valued and auctioned 

Thousands of Londoners made a living from this trade 

Even a schoolboy like Bill Brown could find work as a paper boy selling to ships ' crews from all over the world 

Trade on the Thames remained lively until after the Second World War 

It disappeared rapidly from the nineteen seventies when the old river port which had sustained London for centuries died 

Why that port disappeared is another chapter in the history of the river 

Not much remains but the sand and gravel barges helping to build a monument to the wealth the river had created on the Isle of Dogs 

A few craft have been preserved for the amusement of the new inhabitants of London 's riverside 

The Lady Daphne is now a pleasure boat hired out for executive trips down the empty river 

We 're beginning a new series of Nature with a programme about children 

The children of the nineteen nineties will be the biggest generation ever 

One and a half billion babies will be born over the next ten years 

That 's twice the present population of Africa 

How will they cope with the environmental problems that we have created 

Do we

or will they have the power to make the changes for the better 

Later in the programme we 'll be reporting from a world summit meeting about just those questions 

Chitchats or action 

More from New York later 

Here the Government has recognised that schoolteachers will have to educate children about the environment if future generations are to solve global problems 

From September lessons on the environment will be compulsory in England and Wales an essential part of the National Curriculum 

For a preview of what 's in store we 've come to a school where environmental education is already on the timetable 

In fact these twelve-year-olds probably know a great deal more about the earth 's problems than most adults 

Environmental education has been part of the timetable at  school in Aberystwyth for years now 

From September it 'll be compulsory at all primary and secondary schools  more than twenty-five thousand of them 

Environmental lessons will be incorporated into a new national geography syllabus 

Kay Edwards helped design the new course 

The children are encouraged to look at both sides of the argument 

Class Two has to weigh environmental costs  against economic benefits 

In this case destruction of the rainforests is not just an ecological disaster 

it 's also a way of coping with Brazil 's poverty 

In written work and discussion the children learn that trees are cleared to raise cattle and grow crops 

It may be bad for the earth 's climate  but in the short term it 's good for Brazil 's economy 

Planting trees in Wales can be as controversial as chopping them down in Brazil 

Rows of regimented conifers are not always a welcome addition to the landscape 

Class Two are here to assess their impact 

By any measure they 're already developing an understanding of the environment 

Children learn about environmental problems here 

In other countries they die from them 

Children are the most vulnerable group for some obvious  some complicated reasons

They 're small 

They 're weak

They need food more regularly 

They 're more careless 

The most common killer of children in some countries is diarrhoea  mainly from polluted water 

Diarrhoea kills seven thousand children under the age of five every day 

The stinking slums which surround the first city of the third world are fertile breeding grounds for the water-borne bacteria which cause diarrhoea and death to so many thousands of children 

The poor areas of Mexico City are awash with polluted water 

Open sewers run through the streets irresistible playgrounds for the young 

The combination of natural curiosity and lack of immunity means a child is ten times more likely to develop diarrhoea than an adult 

Mexico City is the most populous city on earth 

The growing numbers put an unbearable strain on the city 's natural resources 

The most precious of those resources is water 

The city has no river and must bear the heavy cost of pumping water in and sewage out over the surrounding mountains 

As many as a million children are born into Mexico 's slums every year 

Their homes do-it-yourself shacks put up without any planning have none of the basic services 

Water the most basic of all is the biggest problem 

Here as in so many parts of the third world running water is a luxury 

clean water rarer still 

Three out of five homes have it on tap 

But only one in five has it free from pollution 

Mexico 's struggled with the problem for generations 

But there 's now a strong sense that the next generation deserves better 

There 's no quick fix to the city 's environmental problems  but there is a simple cheap cure for its most common child-killer 

Diarrhoea kills children by making them dehydrated 

The United Nations children 's organisation UNICEF is sponsoring a worldwide programme which could save them 

In Mexico 's biggest children 's hospital mothers are being taught the technique of oral rehydration 

A simple solution of glucose sodium and potassium replaces the fluids lost during an attack of diarrhoea 

The British medical journal The Lancet has described oral rehydration as potentially the most important medical advance of the century 

It 's been available now for two decades yet in that time a hundred million children have died from diarrhoea 

But the nineteen nineties won't offer medical answers to all the consequences of the earth 's environmental problems 

Atmospheric pollution is the other big child-killer

It causes respiratory complaints and across the world accounts for a quarter of deaths among the under-fives 

In Mexico City motor vehicles three million of them produce eighty per cent of the contamination in the air 

It 's thought that the perpetual blanket of thick smog which smothers the city kills forty-five thousand babies and toddlers every year 

Whatever the source of air pollution the young are always the most vulnerable 

The world stands poised on the brink of its biggest ever baby boom  one and a half billion births over the next decade 

In Mexico alone there 'll be nearly two million new mouths to feed every year 

The country 's president told me this was a cause both for concern and optimism 

Children aren't only the victims of environmental problems 

they can also be a focus for change 

The United Nations in New York recently staged a world summit for children 

The president of Mexico organised it after a long campaign by hundreds of children 's groups 

We sent a team of young reporters  from the Early Times newspaper 

That 's it for this week 

I 'll leave you with the final message that was given to the world leaders at that summit 

It came from the United Nations children 's organisation  a direct appeal to those leaders to concentrate on the generations to come

In the past musicians could copy the sound and style of another group or even take the occasional musical idea

but with a sampler today 's musicians can make a literal copy of someone else 's work  and add it to their own 

For some this so-called age of plunder is a dream come true  instant access to that guitar lick or drum pattern it would take years to learn to play 

But for others it 's a nightmare as they find their work being used without permission 

But how did this situation come about 

How have samplers evolved 

Who is sampling who

And ultimately is it legal 

Prior to the arrival of digital technology there was only one machine that could accurately re-create the sound of real instruments on a keyboard 

Invented in the late sixties the melotron used a complicated system of loop tape recordings to achieve an effect similar to sampling 

It proved particularly popular with progressive rock groups like The Moody Blues who made use of it on their famous track Nights in White Satin 

Genesis also favoured the melotron 's unique sound  and they featured it heavily on many of their classic early seventies albums 

Tony Banks Genesis 's keyboard player recalls using the machine



In nineteen seventy-five Gabriel left Genesis to pursue a solo career and greater musical freedom 

With his interest in unusual sounds and instruments he naturally followed developments in music technology 

and in nineteen seventy-nine he became one of the privileged few to see a demonstration model of the world 's first commercially available digital sampler the Fairlite Computer Musical Instrument 

One of his collaborators at the time was cousin Stephen Payne a keyboard player and expert in sound synthesis 

He also saw the Fairlite C M I in action

Did it excite him

Despite the enormous price tag on the machine Gabriel decided to invest in one and it was first used briefly on the album Peter Gabriel Three 

However it wasn't until his fourth album that the instrument 's capabilities were more fully explored 

Producer Trevor Horne was also amongst the first to invest in a Fairlite and together with J J Dix Alec Gary Langhan and Anne Dudley  he formed the group The Art of Noise 

Their early singles Close to the Edit Beat Box and Moments in Love and their debut album Who 's Afraid of The Art of Noise are milestones in sample-based music 

Anne Dudley remembers her first encounter with the instrument

With the Fairlite the Art of Noise were able to fulfil the futurist dream by making music from any sounds they could record including slamming doors  and a car 's starter motor 

By the mid-eighties samplers had established their ability to generate copies of real instruments or sounds from nature 

But only the occasional orchestra stand had actually been stolen from an already recorded source 

It took hip-hop to popularize the idea of quoting significant parts from other records especially so-called cut up records like Grandmaster Flash 's Adventures on the Wheels of Steel which were composed entirely from existing vinyl 

In the U K Bill Drummond former manager of Echo and the Bunnymen joined forces with colleague Jimmy Caughtie to make a series of hip-hop-inspired audio collage records 

They formed a group called The Jams but are perhaps better known today as the K L F responsible for the hits What Time Is and Three A M Eternal 

Drummond recalls his initial inspiration

The Jam 's first single All You Need Is Love utilising samples from The Beatles Sam Fox and The Sound of Music to make a statement about the current AIDS crisis 

And in terms of audio collage it was undoubtedly a groundbreaking record 

It also clearly flouted copyright law and in its original form no label or distributor would agree to touch it 

Were Drummond and Caughtie surprised by the reaction to the record

Undoubtedly dance music has taken sampling on board far faster than any other musical genre

Dave Durrell manages many of Britain 's top re-mixes and is a D J and re-mixer himself

Does he consider sampling to have been an important innovation

Having faced litigation does Durrell now believe there should be restrictions on the use of sampling

So what exactly is the current legal position on sampling

Andrew Jenkins head of Polydor 's U K legal department

So who actually decides whether a sample can be used or not

Does Jenkins believe there is sufficient legislation at present to deal with sampling cases

Christians in Albania have been guaranteed the right to preach their religion  according to a new draft constitution published recently 

New clauses in the constitution also say that the state observes the freedom of religious faith  but some ob observers have said that it could just be a ploy by the government to increase their support  in next month 's elections 

Pro-life groups have been angered this week by attempts to push through the introduction of a new abortion pill 

The Medicines Control Agency is trying to fast-track the controversial pill  which works by blocking the action of a hormone progesterone  which is vital to maintain pregnancy 

But Catherine Fran&ccedille;ois of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children  has expressed grave doubts about the pill 

Proper testing hasn't been carried out she says  and there could be an increased risk of cancer 

Miss Fran&ccedille;ois who has labelled the pill a human pesticide is urging Christians to voice their opposition to the drug 

Two and a half million Bibles and Bible portions have been supplied to the Soviet Union and eastern European countries during nineteen ninety 

Fifty-six per cent of the Bibles were supplied to the Soviet Union followed by Rumania who received sixteen per cent 

But according to the United Bible Societies these figures don't tell the whole story  as some countries imported paper  on which to print their own Bibles 

The Evangelical Alliance Relief Fund is set to benefit from the recycling of office waste 

A company based in Bath has agreed to donate one pound fifty for every spent toner cartridge received  from a wide range of photocopiers and laser printers 

The company reckons that a hundred thousand cartridges are discarded every month so the potential income for TEAR Fund could be considerable 

TEAR Fund says that each toner cartridge recycled represents a week 's food for a child in a Third World country 

And finally today marks the beginning of a week of Christian unity  so it 's an opportunity for Christians everywhere to at least unite in prayer for a speedy end to the war in the Gulf

The Villa Somalia which was Siad Barre 's official residence in Mogadishu still lies abandoned  guarded by a handful of young men from the United Somali Congress the rebel force which took control of Mogadishu at the end of January 

But it was in one of the office buildings that I discovered the letters  thousands of them  addressed to His Excellency President Mohammed Siad Barre but all unopened 

I picked up one from Britain 

It had been posted in September nineteen eighty-eight and was signed by a retired schoolteacher from Guildford in Surrey  writing on behalf of Amnesty International to plead for the release of a blind Somali preacher who 'd been imprisoned for his religious beliefs 

The mass of similar letters from all parts of the world were a stark reminder of Somalia 's appalling human rights record under Siad Barre  although on my return from Mogadishu last week Amnesty confirmed that the preacher for whom it had campaigned had actually been released some time in nineteen eighty-nine 

The flood of letters must have had some impact after all 

Siad Barre is still thought to be in the south-west of the country having sought refuge among the members of his minority Marahan clan

His near presence is an obstacle to political reconciliation 

Although Somalis are determined that he should never be allowed to stage a comeback  troops still loyal to the former leader have been active in southern Somalia  and appear to have drawn wider support  using the money and arms with which they escaped from Mogadishu in January 

Last week in the company of two other journalists I ventured into the Somali countryside to investigate the continuing conflict 

Transport and fuel are a problem  but with the help of the entrepreneurial Somalis who prey on foreign visitors at Mogadishu 's  Hotel we were eventually able to hire a vehicle and two gunmen for protection 

Unfortunately it turned out to be a lumbering camper van probably looted last year from a fleeing expatriate family who once used it for weekends away 

It was an incongruous sight on the sandy roads south toward Gismaio as we met U S C fighters in their cut-down Land Rovers with machine guns and bazookas mounted on the back 

Dressed in civilian clothes they gave the impression of being members of a rabble army 

And when we asked for a demonstration of their heaviest gun it took them ten minutes to fire it 

There were signs of skirmishing on the roadside  the occasional corpse  and a large number of wrecked vehicles which had been stripped bare 

But for the time being at least it seemed the U S C had without difficulty driven the opposition south in some haste 

Back in Mogadishu Somalia 's acting president Ali Madi told us that if Siad Barre and his supporters could be chased out of the country  everything would be all right 

Somalis share one language one religion and one culture he said but Siad Barre is still dividing our people

Once he 's gone we can solve all our political differences

Ali Madi is an unlikely person to be holding the reins of power 

He 's a fifty-two-year-old businessman and hotelier  who helped to finance the United Somali Congress when it was first established in Rome 

As we sat in Ali Madi 's house  freshly decorated and lavishly refurnished after being looted in January  the acting president expressed his disappointment that so many in the international community had apparently turned their backs on Somalia 

Only Egypt has so far recognised the caretaker government and reopened its Embassy in Mogadishu 

Humanitarian aid has been slow in coming  and now many in the capital are beginning to starve 

Only a handful of international relief agencies are currently working in the country 

The failure of the caretaker government to convene a national reconciliation conference  fears over security and the lack of communications with the outside world  have left Somalia isolated 

Walking in the streets of the once picturesque old quarter of Mogadishu near the deserted British Embassy  I came across Brian Bowden  a British water engineer who 's lived in Somalia for thirty-three years 

Until the evacuation of the British Embassy in January he 'd been working for the Overseas Development Agency in charge of a tse-tse fly monitoring project 

Mr Bowden has a Somali wife and hasn't been out of the country since nineteen sixty-eight 

He chose to stay on in Mogadishu through the height of the fighting in January and says it 's high time that a British Government representative came back to Mogadishu if only to look at the situation 

In the meantime Mr Bowden is trying to clean up the British Embassy wrecked by the looters of Mogadishu  who left behind only a mountain of official papers and documents 

If the international community is to return much may depend on the moves made by the Italian Government  despite a somewhat ambivalent relationship between Italy and Somalia 

Some say that Italy as a former colonial power has a moral obligation to lead the way and help the Somalis in their hour of need  but others argue that the Italians propped up Siad Barre 's repressive regime for too long  and should now stay away 

But what Somalia needs above all else is peace between its own people who remain divided by clan loyalties 

The U S C quietly admits that some form of foreign mediation may now be the only answer

The North Pole is no ordinary explorers ' obsession

It 's a moving target 

To reach it on foot you must navigate hundreds of miles across a perishing sub-zero landscape of blizzards open water crevasses and drifting ice 

Beneath it an ocean ten thousand feet deep that will kill you in minutes if the ice gives way 

Ever since Robert Peary reached the North Pole in nineteen hundred and nine explorers have been fascinated by the challenge

Many have tried

Few have succeeded and no-one has yet made it without the support of dogs vehicles or aircraft to carry supplies 

British explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes reached both Poles with support in a transglobe expedition of nineteen eighty-one 

He became convinced he could reach the North Pole unaided 

He 's tried three times

And each time failed 

To reach the North Pole unsupported means dragging three hundred pounds of food fuel and other supplies for more than fifty days through the most hostile conditions on earth 

In March nineteen ninety taking advantage of glasnost Fiennes and his partner Dr Michael Stroud set out for the Pole from the Soviet Arctic

But this time it was a race

In Northern Canada three Norwegians are launching their attempt to get there first 

This is the story of an epic struggle between two teams of men determined to make history

Instead it ends in bitter controversy 

A re-run of the race to the South Pole eighty years ago between Scott and Amundsen  this time to conquer the world 's last great Polar challenge 

Red Square in the heart of Moscow 

Two years ago a sight like this would 've been unthinkable 

Past the queues of tourists outside Lenin 's tomb strides a British explorer with a string of military adventures behind him most of them aimed at the defeat of Communism 

Former S A S officer Sir Ranulph Fiennes along with Dr Michael Stroud and Lawrence and Morag Howell are working with Soviet comrades to attempt an unsupported trek to the North Pole 

The hardware of the Cold War years is now put to a different use 

Soviet military transport and access to forward bases of the Soviet Army on the remote Arctic fringes are essential to Fiennes ' game plan of attacking the Pole from the northernmost pinnacle of Soviet Russia 

Fiennes and Stroud take off in an Antinov Twelve military transport for the fourteen hour journey to the northernmost tip of the Soviet Union 

Their destination the island of  part of Severnaya Zemlya literally North Land not discovered until nineteen twelve and the last place on earth to be mapped 

As they edge closer to the Arctic Ran and Mike must wonder if the Soviet Union offers them a greater chance of success than their three previous attempts from Canada 

This is how Fiennes and Stroud first met in nineteen eighty-six 

Stroud had flown out to Canada from England after Fiennes radioed for a partner to join him on his first effort to reach the Pole unsupported 

They 've never improved on the distance covered on that first expedition 

As supplies are unloaded there 's a chance to meet expedition organiser Dimitri Sparo 

And with temperatures at minus forty celsius at this lonely Russian airbase there 's a chance to reflect on the enormity of the human task that lies ahead 

One thousand miles across the Arctic Ocean in Northern Canada three Norwegians Berger Ausland Ger Rondbe and Erling Kager get ready to mount their challenge to reach the Pole unaided 

The Canadian team has already set off but they 'll give up after less than a week 

These three however are convinced they can finish the job 

In nineteen hundred and twelve while the Russians were still surveying their own northernmost land mass the race was on to reach the South Pole and Norwegian Raoul Amundsen got there ahead of Englishman Captain Scott

Scott and his team perished on the way home 

But in Britain Amundsen never enjoyed the recognition he undoubtedly deserved

Scott meanwhile became a national hero 

Amundsen believed his success was due to the long experience of Norwegian explorers in the harsh conditions of the polar regions 

Seventy-eight years later Fiennes ' Norwegian rivals have cast themselves in the role of Amundsen seeing their race to the North Pole as a rematch 

They chose to start their daunting trek from the Canadian Arctic

Training first at Ikalowit they 'll fly north toward Hunt Island

Though the pack ice is tougher the route is shorter by a hundred and twenty miles 

In desolate wastes like these everything depends on painstaking preparation of clothing and equipment 

A lightweight radio has saved the Norwegians more than twenty pounds

It 's just a fifth the weight of the equipment carried by Fiennes

Instead of contact with a base camp the Norwegian team will use a preset frequency to contact airliners flying overhead using a ski as the antenna 

At the British team 's Soviet base camp Ran and Mike Stroud complete their final preparations  ahead of them six hundred miles of drifting ice 

Their choice of a longer route is based on calculations that the ice will drift in their favour with prevailing winds carrying them northwards 

Ran and Mike will have to pull their life-supporting supplies behind them over some of the world 's most dangerous terrain 

Temperatures will drop below minus forty celsius

Winds will reach gale force 

And since goggles will mist up in the freezing snow blizzards could render them half blind 

Everything they carry will have to earn its keep

Most vital food and fuel 

To save weight Ran and Mike plan to survive on the bare minimum of food intake for such a demanding journey five thousand calories a day dropping to four and a half thousand calories when the sleds grow lighter  a complex arithmetic of survival that is yet to stand the test 

This back-breaking regime is what an unsupported trek is about and why no-one has yet made it unaided to the North Pole 

In Canada the Norwegians have no doubts about their chances

Their route is shorter and their rations better

Seventy days of fuel and upwards of six thousand precious calories a day and all three are superior skiers with long experience of tough arctic conditions 

Dimitri has also strongly advised the British pair that weather conditions are not right 

But on March the seventh Fiennes and Stroud decide to set off for the Pole 

The sleds are loaded aboard a Soviet helicopter that 'll fly them north to Cape Artichevsky an old forward bomber base from the darkest days of the Cold War and the last piece of land before the Arctic Ocean 

This is the last time Ran and Mike will see their Soviet colleagues until the long trek is over 

Now it 's down to hard work human daring  and luck 

It 's a bizarre picture of politics turned on its head 

Two British sleds rumble down a frozen runway built for Soviet bombers to launch attacks against U S targets in the fifties 

Today 's mission has a more benign objective 

The British trek is sponsored mile by mile to raise money for the Multiple Sclerosis Society 

Ran and Mike have enough food and fuel for forty-five days and more than five hundred miles to the North Pole with no outside support 

Yet even with support no other team has ever done it in less than fifty-five days 

If they 're to succeed the two men will need to make unprecedented progress  dragging their three hundred pound sleds and a tiny video camera for more than ten hours a day through some of the worst conditions on the planet 

With the British Polar team now one day ahead of them the Norwegians fly to remote Ward Hunt Island the last outpost of land in Northern Canada  and the place Ranulph Fiennes launched his last three unsuccessful attempts to reach the Pole unaided 

The plane lands on a snow-swept ice shelf and the team readies itself for departure 

When the plane takes off again the nearest civilisation will be seven hundred miles away their small V H F radio the only link with the outside world 

Ahead of them a no-man's-land of deep crevasses and ice boulders forty feet high 

Survival and success now depends depend on the simplest details

How deep is the snow

Will the sleds perform as planned

Will their equipment do the job

It won't be long before the team hit a snag and with sixty more days ahead of them even Berger 's natural optimism wanes 

The Norwegians find it tough going through the thick jungle of ice 

The temperature drops to minus sixty 

In conditions like this eighty years ago Peary had cut off seven of his frostbitten toes with a knife 

Ran and Mike meanwhile are finding good surfaces and have pushed on hard for the first two days 

Even Ran 's radio operator Flo finds his sceptical Russian colleagues are impressed with the mileage already covered 

But even when things are going well in conditions like this the slightest event can spell big trouble 

For the Norwegians too it 'll be hard going 

Huge pressure ridges and drift snow block their path 

Even meticulous planning can't protect them from unforeseen events like a broken ski shoe  a minor piece of bad luck that could prove disastrous 

But Berger is a master of self-help and innovation 

Every night they pitch camp precariously in the snow-covered wilderness sleeping fitfully on dangerous shifting pack ice that shrieks as it moves 

There 's the ever-present fear that the ice will shear off dragging you down into the open chasm beneath you 

Getting up each morning in sub-zero temperatures after a few hours ' broken sleep calls for colossal willpower 

The body has just begun to thaw from the previous day

Now it 's back to the ten hour grind through the Arctic wilds 

At daybreak everything has to be dried

Any moisture left on clothes or bedding will freeze permanently adding extra weight and making sleep more difficult the following night 

Their high energy daily diet is always the same  porridge mixed with fat sugar and high fat chocolate with freeze-dried meat and rice or potatoes for dinner 

Even then it 's a welcome chance to warm freezing hands over a steaming bowl of food 

This daily routine would break even the most hardy Inuit 

As you move you sweat

When you stop to rest the sweat freezes 

Such was the pervasive sense of hunger that Berger Ausland 's diary became filled with crazy recipes as he fantasized about pork roasts spaghetti 

At an age when they might want to take things easy  many women like sixty-three-year-old Eileen Allen are running around after older relatives 

When there is caring to be done the main burden almost always falls on one woman in the family 

Because one of her sisters lives a hundred odd miles away and the other can't drive Eileen has more than her fair share 

As well as her eighty-six-year-old mother-in-law there are her cousins  three stalwart sisters octogenarians all 

Edna is eighty-six and a former gym mistress 

She 's now virtually housebound 

Nellie who 's eighty-four is the only sister who never married 

She lives in a residential home where she used to be a parlour maid 

The baby is eighty  fit as a fiddle until recently when she developed a dodgy leg 

This is Cousin Renee who is not to be confused with Auntie Renee 

And this is Ivy the matriarch 

Eileen has lived all her life in Rotherham Yorkshire 

Six years ago she stopped teaching and retired with her husband Ernest to a bungalow high on a hill in a genteel part of town 

I have spent a quarter of a century among parish councils which have by the way nothing to do with the church but are concerned with village government 

It landed me in some small adventures such as no reasonable Anglo-Prussian might expect 

I got into this because cerebro-spinal meningitis put me out of action for six months in nineteen fifty-two  and as few barristers ' practices can stand that sort of interruption I applied for a job 

The national association of parish now local councils needed a national secretary

It looked interesting even if underpaid 

The interviewing committee of twelve seemed a rum lot 

An admiral was in the chair and there was a weather-beaten lady and in those beardless times a fiercely bearded egghead

It took some while but I managed to make them laugh and came away with the impression that it was in the bag 

As usual in such matters I was wrong

They offered it to someone else but he changed his mind so they had to make do with me 

The outgoing incumbent regaled me with horror stories

There was too much work

there was no money

members were deserting

everybody hated us 

The worse it seemed the more cheerful I felt

Something obviously needed to be done 

She was going to a nice comfortable job in Sarawak

I was casting caution to the winds

At the start I used to get two or three abusive letters a week

Hooray 

The very day I sat down at my new desk I had my first experience of local government negotiation at a shouting match with the associations representing the counties and districts 

We had tabled a policy document a harmless little thing

it was mostly about public benches and footpaths and wastepaper baskets  but going by the uproar it might have been the surrealist and communist manifestos rolled into a U D I 

These people plainly detested us but the very fact that we were in the same room with them added significance 

There were at that time two local government factions 

on the one hand the boroughs wanted to abolish the system and replace it with a uniform network of boroughs  on the other the counties and districts wanted to keep the system and tidy it up at the edges 

The latter feared the boroughs because of their masses of urban voters and were looking for allies

That was why weak as we were they had invited us in 

Actually in the mutual admiration society of local government the hatred or indifference of the public was overlooked

The borough electors for example actually knew nothing of the issues  and as the voting turnout showed cared even less

It was not nominal electoral mass but political contacts which gave clout

In this the parishes were deficient but could compete

I set out to fill the gap 

Politicians were not then esteemed and many people of distinction got career satisfaction in other fields such as law or philanthropy

We 'd already attracted one or two including William Third Lord Merther and Richard Fort Tory M P for Clitheroe 

Their intervention was timely for in the general movement of events we had to make a quick public impact while the association was still on an uneven keel 

We could never be news of the sort beloved by the national media but I could write for local and specialist journals for I have something so far unsaid  uh and besides I needed the money 

I made friends with English and European local government periodicals

indeed because I spoke German and French I was once commissioned by two deadly rivals to cover a ten-day conference in Brussels each by their own correspondent

and each congratulated me on how much better their reports were than the other 's 

Specialist journalism and lobbying put us into natural contact with the two groups important to us the civil servants and the legislators 

The thin end of our parliamentary wedge was the anomalous in fact often daft condition of parish law  which had been made intermittently since eighteen twelve by parliaments where in truth the concerns of small bodies such as ours had been far below the horizon of the good the great and the very bad 

The result had been laughably maddening 

One group of examples will suffice 

To provide a shelter a parish council had to be given the power by a simple majority of an electors ' meeting and then raise half the money by an appeal 

A two-thirds majority but no appeal was needed for a lamp post in a street  but for a lamp post in an open space it could manage without the meeting or the appeal but had to seek the power from the county council 

Our parliamentary build-up made it feasible to promote legislation and the consequent need to brief members with civil servants resulted in they and I actually learning something about parishes 

We also obviously had to try and educate our people but where to begin 

In my first year I was away forty weekends teaching 

I once ran a joint session for parish councillors and schoolchildren 

One of the difficulties was that there was no reliable book on the subject 

I now ran into a long-lost publishing friend who invited me to write a book

It seemed a splendid way of getting my ideas straight 

so I wrote Local Council Administration which has lately been republished 

My theory was that the councils would read it and write me less often for advice 

In fact they simply asked harder questions 

One by-product of this essentially rural work was that with the late Robert Ayckman I became and remain a waterways revivalist

I even organised a mass meeting of M Ps about it 

Another was that in nineteen fifty-five I was asked to serve on the Royal Commission on Common Lands under Sir Ivor Jennings 

Royal commissions are a dormant if not extinct breed 

They labour long and by the time they finish the circumstances or emotions which called them forth may have disappeared 

The pre-nineteen fourteen Canal Commission 's admirable report was wholly ignored 

And then Lord Rothschild said that royal commissions cost a million pounds each and everybody let out a loud whistle 

Ours did not cost that

We were unpaid we had a staff of four and our expenses were reimbursed on so low a scale that we could just afford to lunch together in a second class restaurant near Baker Street 

I can think of two other reasons for their eclipse 

one is that modern bureaucracy is so vast and expensive that governments have to keep it at work and do what royal commissions did before 

If this is so I would have thought that temporary even expensive commissions would be cheaper 

The second reason is that if commission reports were as cavalierly treated as they are nobody worth having will serve on them 

But in nineteen fifty-five all this was in the future 

Our commission first met in one of those beautiful Regents Park terrace houses 

We were a mixed lot

Jennings was fresh from drafting the constitution of Malaysia 

The only colleague whom I knew already was the social and physical geographer Doctor Dudley Stamp who like myself had long been on the Council for the Protection of Rural England 

One of the mass demands much voiced by the Labour Party was the use of the countryside for recreation 

Commons are common only to certain individuals who happen to share rights in the land in common with some other individuals 

The popular fallacy that they were common to all was one factor which created the Jennings Commission  and we had to take the demand seriously 

These lands over a million acres of them were derelict because everybody had forgotten who had what rights or duties over them 

It seemed dog-in-the-mangerish to keep strangers out when no one apparently bothered with them 

And besides it was said that there was a huge miserable urban proletariat with nowhere to go 

This picture was hotly criticised 

The amenity lobby contended that if you let loose hoards of trippers on these scattered properties their numbers and vulgarity would erode and destroy them and so defeat the very purpose of letting them in 

Both sides were wrong 

The urban proles were car-borne or on the Costa Brava 

Then the ecologists said that they contained rare plants and fauna many close to extinction 

We had Professor Alan Roberts and Colonel Floyd distinguished rural scientists to cope with this 

Sir Alan Lubbock a friend of the Sitwells saw the world from a literary and aesthetic point of view 

Trevor Emms the Duke of Norfolk 's agent and Sir Leslie Scott a land commissioner were level-headed men with a lifetime of land management behind them 

None of these accepted extremist arguments at their face value 

Nor was history forgotten 

Commons are mostly the residue of a pre-Norman manorial system  and so we had Doctor William Hoskins the historian 

In this talented group I was obviously the odd man out 

I was less endowed and with my German background my experience was peculiar 

They were mostly in their fifties and sixties

I was thirty-seven 

My only contemporary was George Wild the Commission 's energetic and able secretary 

He was a recent example of the long line of literate golden-style civil servants to whom the English nation and its language owe so much 

We advertised ourselves and then met two days a week 

Pressure groups idealists lords of manors commoners cranks government departments public industries sent us memoranda which varied from weighty documents with many appendices to a few sentences scribbled on cheap notepaper 

One noticeable feature was that so many eager witnesses repeated each other yet believed that no-one else had said it 

There was for example that witty jingle to which we had to pay becoming attention whenever it was quoted 



We travelled far and wide

The Corporation of London took us to Epping Forest in a splendid motorcade  and after showing us round that interesting territory with its deer its cattle customs and its woods entertained us at a hunting lodge

There were three huge fireplaces that blazed with logs against the winter cold  and a delicious meal served by liveried foresters wearing heather-brown bowler hats 

That 's the way to treat a Royal Commission 

Elsewhere our reception might be less elaborate 

Once we arrived in a battered bus at a village pub on the confines of Yorkshire and Westmoreland 

The commoners a rascally looking lot were standing about in their overcoats 

They wanted us to make them the private owners of the huge nearby common 

We explained as we 'd already done by letter that we could only inquire and recommend 

This seemed to annoy them 

We had they hinted been wasting their time 

We asked for the documents which they had mentioned

Documents

what documents

What they wanted was  and so on 

After three years George presented the draft report for our approval 

We had a friendly press conference and dispersed 

None of us were sanguine

we knew too much about the government regime for that  and when seven years later the Commons Registration Act was passed ostensibly on the basis of our report  the government of the day got it wrong 

Would you like to know how 

Commons are our last uncommitted land resource 

We devised ways of ensuring that they remained uncommitted yet put to environmentally-satisfying use 

These ways were left out of the act with the result that astute gravel merchants and estate developers exploit loopholes in the law to discommon and ravage 

I believe that I 'm the last survivor of the commission 

I trust that I 'm not a lone voice 

The celebrations have been extensive and impressive and taken together constitute an enormous outpouring of affection and admiration for both the author and her creation whose appeal is as fresh and undimmed now as it was when he first burst upon an unsuspecting world in nineteen nineteen 

Richmal Crompton succeeded in mastering the short story form and in thirty-eight volumes over fifty years she developed a distinctive and self-contained universe through which to comment on society the family childhood and human nature 

Her work is best described as social comedy and she occupies a position socially and culturally that is midway between P G Wodehouse and Frank Richards 

The Wodehouse world encompassed West End clubland and the country house weekend

The Richards world centred on the timeless ritualised life of the boys ' public school

Miss Crompton 's world was essentially suburbia the world that she observed from the windows of The Glebe Bromley the house she built from the profits generated by her famous creation 

There was a commuting father who was something in the city a placid mother who when she was not darning participated in all the social rituals of suburbia  and a comfortable house The Hollies serviced in prewar years by two maids a cook and a gardener but reduced after the war like many a middle-class household to a daily help

Round the corner were The Lilacs The Laurels The Firs The Laburnums and Beech View

Every aspect of this world is faithfully documented in Mary Cadogan 's authoritative William Companion 

But the three worlds overlap 

All three are located in the mythified undifferentiated home counties and feature a common cast of supporting characters choleric retired generals do-gooding vicars absent-minded professors domineering cooks and assorted spinsters with bees in their bonnets and bats in their belfries the dog-loving the boy-hating the busybody the scatterbrain the short-sighted the long-winded 

But there is more 

Like Bertie Wooster William is troubled by aunts 

He also has to put up with a soppy elder brother Robert who is forever mooning about some girl or other and a sister Ethel who has all the brisk no-nonsense superiority of a true Wodehouse gel

Similarly William is the leader of an archetypal boy gang the Outlaws Ginger Douglas Henry and Jumble the dog serving perhaps as a junior version of Harry Wharton and the Famous Five of Greyfriars though William operates almost totally outside school 

The stories frequently deploy those old standbys of comedy the misunderstanding the coincidence and mistaken identity

But they unfold against the lovingly evoked suburban world of regular meals and formal visits garden f&ecircumflex;tes and flower shows good works and improving activities

The world of William is above all a world of societies in which the middle classes expend their energies their enthusiasms and their spare time ranging from the amateur dramatic society to the archaeological society from the brass rubbing club to the flower-arranging club from the League of Nations Society to the League of Perfect Health 

They 're all observed with an amused affection by Miss Crompton but she extracts endless and rather more merciless fun at the expense of faddists cranks proselytising enthusiasts who allow their hobbies to take them over and who seek to convert the rest of society to their beliefs

So the wilder fringes of such groups as vegetarians bird lovers spiritualists total abstainers literary bohemians self-sufficiency advocates and fresh air fiends all suffer from the fascinated attention of William 

People often think of the world of William as being a timeless inter-war period

But while William and his family never changed their environment did and Miss Crompton faithfully reflected the cultural changes over the fifty years of her writing life 

William lived on to the age of television moon rockets and pop-singers

But one of the most fertile sources of inspiration was the Second World War

To read the wartime Williams is to be transported back to the suburban home front but a home front observed from the child 's eye view just as John Boorman observed it in his autobiographical film Hope and Glory 

For the Outlaws the war is fun a glorious adventure providing new heroes and new experiences

Evacuation for instance is seen in Miss Crompton 's words as a matter of games entertainment unlimited food of unusual kinds and a glorious crumbling of the whole fabric of discipline

William as anxious as anyone to do his bit creates predictable mayhem against a convincing background of digging for victory holidays at home salvage collection the Spitfire Fund clothing coupons evacuees the blackout A R P land girls the Home Guard and the Brains Trust all the reference points of a past era perfectly preserved for posterity as they were occurring 

Ethel joins the A T S Mrs Brown is in her element with make do and mend and suburbia rallies round diverting its energies to the national effort 

But at the centre of Miss Crompton 's universe stands William himself inspired in part perhaps by Booth Tarkington 's Penrod in part by Miss Crompton 's brother Jack and later her nephew Tommy and in part by her own understanding of the child mentality

She gave her own summing up of his character in an article written in nineteen sixty-two





























Miss Crompton 's psychological observation is acute and this coupled with her infallible comic sense her fertile invention and her precise use of language enabled her to explore this multifaceted character for fifty years

Writing originally for an adult magazine she soon also captured a devoted youthful following both male and female

Children recognised in William either a kindred soul or a wish fulfilment figure

Parents could relate strongly to the mayhem and embarrassment caused

But above all to civilised society as a whole William represented the ultimate free spirit

His preferred occupations pirate smuggler highwayman red Indian his gang the Outlaws his natural habitat the woods the fields the lanes the old barn are all part of the same deep-rooted nostalgia for pre-industrial pre-adult innocence which has inspired the centuries-old idealizations of Robin Hood and Dick Turpin

It is the life of freedom freedom from restraint and responsibility from the humdrum cares of everyday life and from the darker drives and psychological complexities of adulthood

But most of all living for the moment enjoying life to the full under the greenwood tree or out on the open road 

Miss Crompton summed it up effortlessly and economically when she wrote  What 'll we do this morning said Ginger





The whole world lay before them 

or even more succinctly 

Everything had gone wrong today

everything might go wrong tomorrow 

but bullseyes still remained 

William 's basic philosophy is outlined in his essay What 's Wrong with Civilisation from a newly edited collection of his philosophical musings in the Happy Magazine



William 's recipe for happiness is thus to live in a cave rather than a house to catch and cook and eat your own food not to worry about the polite rigmarole of good manners or washing your hands before meals or eating with a knife and fork or wearing a collar and tie and certainly not wasting the best years of your life in school learning things that wouldn't be any use to me even if I did learn them when I might be going out with a club dressed in skins and fighting everyone I met and chasing prehistoric animals over rocks 

And as for modern inventions William thought them vastly overrated

Printing because it produced books you were made to read

telephones which enabled people to ring up and complain to your father about your behaviour

and photography which involves you being scrubbed and dressed up and forced to smile inanely 

He lived his philosophy to the full in his defiance of all the rules of good appearance and good behaviour

Truculent is an adjective frequently applied to William 

Miss Crompton was well served by Thomas Henry who illustrated thirty-three of the books before his death in nineteen sixty-two

He created the visual image of William as indelibly as Sidney Paget did that of Sherlock Holmes or C H Chapman that of the other William William George Bunter the fat owl of the Greyfriars Remove

Tousled hair hands in pockets shoelaces undone socks hanging down tie askew collar sticking up face grubby blazer crumpled cap on the back of head William was a walking defiance of all the canons of tidiness the despair of mothers and teachers everywhere 

This was matched by his hostility to school and his contempt for book learning which was very low on his order of priorities

When during the war they heard of the Beveridge Report William and his chums drew up the Outlaws ' Report which fully expressed their world view

A six point plan which involved having as much holidays as school no afternoon school sixpence a week pocket money no Latin French or arithmetic unlimited free supplies of ice cream bananas and cream buns no punishments and staying up as late as you like

The anti-intellectualism gave rise to plenty of the schoolboy howlers that William Brown shared with William Bunter and which gave their creators such amusement William for instance insisting that Guy Fawkes tried to blow up the Crystal Palace

But when he did fasten on a piece of historical information this could form the basis of an entire story as in the cumulatively hilarious tale of William and the Outlaws deciding to live like St Francis and the Franciscans

They call themselves Williamcans don dressing gowns call each other St William St Ginger St Douglas and St Henry and try to preach to Brother Cows and Sister Hens before disillusionment sets in 

But this demonstrates conclusively that William 's actions always have their own internal logic and were often governed by a strong sense of justice as when William is irritated by a local bird lover 's plans for bird week and so organises rat week with astonishing consequences

But it 's the unfairness to rats that stirs him to action and it 's this hatred of injustice and desire to right wrongs that leads him also into his consistent bids to puncture pomposity to deflate self-importance to undermine tyranny and to expose artifice 

William 's distinctive character is counterpointed by alternative models of boyishness soppy sentimentalised little boys like Anthony Martin a wicked parody of A A Milne 's Christopher Robin whose mother makes up rhymes about him like Anthony Martin is doing his sums or snooty know-alls who parade their book-learning and are often called Claude or more seriously William 's arch-rivals Hubert Lane and the Hubert Lane-ites sneaks cheats and pretended goody-goodies always trying to do down William and the Outlaws 

It is also underscored by the presence of girls which involves William in the eternal battle of the sexes 

William clashes regularly with the army of dotty spinsters in the community but most of all he has to resist the blandishments tyranny and unboyishness of girls who in William 's view are  soppy and batty and stuck up and stupid

They can't play fair or talk sense 

The ultimate incarnation of female guile and interference is the pretty frilly lisping six-year-old Violet Elizabeth Bott who has brought blackmail to a fine art with her unanswerable gambit

But what of William 's creator

Richmal Crompton would seem to be the antithesis of her creation 

a devout Anglican and lifelong Conservative a feminist and an intellectual she was a classics teacher in Bromley until polio forced her premature retirement in nineteen twenty-three

It left her lame in her right leg but ensured that she devoted the rest of her life to writing

She seems an unlikely candidate to have created the unruly anti-intellectual specimen of eternal boyhood

But what she shared with her creation was an imaginative inner life

William lived in a world of his own imagination fighting bandits taming lions capturing castles peopling the quiet lanes and orderly back gardens of his home village with all the fantastic adventures and characters dear to someone whose chief reading was sensational fiction like Ralph the Reckless and the Quest of Captain Terrible

Although her own omnivorous reading was more respectable Dickens Trollope Hardy Austen she too lived in a world of her own imagination

She never married claiming never to have been in love and described herself as the last surviving example of the Victorian professional aunt

The two excellent biographies of Miss Crompton by Kay Williams and Mary Cadogan which neatly complement each other and are essential reading mine her adult novels for evidence on her attitudes and relationships

But perhaps the key to her is her shyness

No one who has not experienced it can fully comprehend the agonies of shyness

This is Provence in the south-east corner of France where something much much more powerful comes out of the sky every day 

Sunshine 

And here on this dry desert it 's searing but mix it with a little water and life flourishes 

Since Hercules was here conquerors and tourists have all been intoxicated by this part of France its quality of life its colours and aromas  natural beauty and dazzling light 

Provence is a land of history of ancient myths and strange spiritual matters 

It 's little wonder that so many are still attracted here in search of a slower gentler lifestyle while human curiosity draws huge numbers of visitors seeking some explanation for the mysteries too 

The first foreign occupiers to leave their mark were the Romans who became lords of this land a hundred and eighteen years before the birth of Christ 

They claimed the South of France as a province of Rome

Hence the name Provence 

The Romans knew that such a dry rocky land could never be productive or civilised without plenty of water

So their clever leader Agrippa decided to carry sweet spring water from the hills down to the bathhouses and the fountains of their new settlements over thirty miles away 

All that is left now of this great aqueduct is the Pont du Gard 

This marvel of architecture was built from blocks of stone each weighing many tons and hoisted a hundred and fifty feet above the river Gardogne 

It was completed just nineteen years before the birth of Christ but still it stands 

Although water was a kind of god to the Romans the bridge itself had no religious meaning

Yet it survives as a monument to their power and influence

Obtaining a water supply was clearly worth all the trouble for the Romans occupied Provence for nearly five hundred years 

When Julius Caesar set up his military colony in the town of Arles he created a little Rome

It was the capital of his vast empire of Gaul

Citizens of the new civilisation needed entertaining

So they built themselves a magnificent amphitheatre for popular sporting activities 

Sometimes they used the arena for what they thought was an amusing way of dealing with political dissidents  especially the first Christians 

Before the big show the prisoners were kept back-stage in the dark until it was their turn to go on

They could hear the cheering audience of twenty thousand loyal Roman supporters beyond the gate 

Then they were thrust out into the blinding sunlight and there waiting for them a dozen starving lions 

Many died that way for their faith 

The people of Arles still use this amphitheatre but now for a a gentler entertainment 

This is Escolo Mistralenco dancing their traditional Proven&ccedille;ale farandole

Curious outsiders have always been attracted to Provence 

Vincent van Gogh arrived at the end of the last century to paint his vivid and expressive pictures telling us of his love for the place 

Sadly too much sunshine and far too much alcohol got the better of him

He died by his own hand in a fit of passion 

His images of Arles live on

Les Arlescans has hardly changed 

And this is it 

Les Arlescans means the Elysian Fields and for over two thousand years this was a burial ground

It was built originally for the pagan Romans who believed in nymphs and earth gods but all that was changed with the arrival of a Greek

He was a cousin and disciple of Saint Paul

His name was Trophemus and it was he who introduced Christianity to this land 

Soon afterwards a Roman civil servant called Genesius refused to publish orders to persecute local Christians 

He was beheaded

After his burial miracle cures started to occur by his grave

The word soon got round 

Later when Saint Trophemus was buried here too Les Arlescans became the most desirable graveyard in the Christian world 

A corpse could be wrapped in its winding cloth set afloat anywhere upstream on the Rhone

and when it reached this point the river people would hook it out collect the fee which was gold coins in the mouth  and then give it a decent Christian burial at Les Arlescans 

But interest in the cemetery quickly waned when the bones of Saint Trophemus were removed to Arles where a special cathedral was built as his final resting place 

Trophemus is briefly mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles 

There 's little doubt that he brought Christianity to southern France and was the first Bishop of Arles 

but as all other records and tales of his evangelical life were carved in the cloister nearly a thousand years after he died  his history is rather legendary 

As in most legends the dates don't quite coincide but the story is beautifully told in what is now considered to be the finest example of medieval stone carving in the whole world 

On the west end biblical stories and the deeds of Saint Trophemus are undergoing massive restoration paid for by a large grant from Unesco 



In medieval times Avignon was heavily fortified

It 's now the capital city of the region and a great cultural centre bustling with conferences and art festivals  but it 's lost none of its romance 

Even if you have never been here you may recognise the name Avignon

You may even have a mental picture of the place if you remembered this old song Regardez

It 's hardly a children 's song of innocence

They sing about young courting couples under the bridge in the dark 

Half the song is in Proven&ccedille;al regional dialect but the meaning hasn't changed 

In the past bridges were sacred places where magic rites were enacted at annual festivals 

The next verse tells of one young girl whose kissing got too passionate or so the gossips claim 

When her mother heard about it  she hurried to the bridge  ooh and she got her just deserts 

Of course publicly everyone disapproved of the goings-on under the bridge 

We all know where that can lead 

But then the Pope arrived 

He walked through the town giving out blessings and absolution to all sinners 

And finally they sing on the bridge of Avignon there they danced there they danced while under the bridge of Avignon the Seven Deadly Sins do their dance 

The bridge they were singing about was inspired by heaven

In eleven hundred and seventy-seven a young shepherd by the name of Benese was commanded by the voice of an angel 

Of course everybody thought he was quite mad but when he lifted a huge block of stone and lifted it above his head  then they realised that he was inspired by a great force

So in no time at all they set about building a much-needed bridge over the Rhone at this point 

The bridge itself has been washed away many times  but the song lingers on 

Avignon was once claimed as the centre of Christendom 

The fourteenth century was a time of great confusion with reforms and disagreements about who should be the Pope 

There was much more than theology at stake

The Church was immensely rich  and had great influential power throughout Europe

Political troubles in Italy led to the French-born Pope Clement the Fifth leaving Rome to set up here in Avignon  and so Le Palais des Papes the Palace of the Popes was built 

And what a mighty building this is

The Palace had to be defended against bands of mercenary knights who used roam the countryside just stealing anything they could 

Seven successive popes lived here before the papacy returned to Rome 

During that time both Avignon and the Palace grew

A university was established in the city and new churches sprang up everywhere 

All kinds of people arrived clergy merchants and artists  until it became one of the liveliest cities in the known world 

Meanwhile the Popes and cardinals lived in considerable splendour

It was essential that the Pope appeared to be the most important ruler in the world 

The surviving wall paintings tell us of their pleasures  hunting with hawks in the forest  fishing with nets from a pond which looks remarkably like a modern swimming pool 

The scale of this Palace is gigantic

It was designed to humble the ordinary man if ever he had to be in the presence of the most powerful church leader in the world

The popes had everything any mortal man could want 

If they wished to see the people they had to look down 

From this grand isolation they could afford to be very tolerant of life outside

and though many thousands came to see the Pope for advice and counsel  even more came to Avignon for the good life thieves smugglers and criminals 

The apparent decadence of the whole city aroused tremendous criticism everywhere 

Eventually after seventy years in residence  the rebel popes returned to Rome 

Their great palace was abandoned  but in Notre Dame des Dons God is still worshipped 

The sound of one of Avignon 's many choirs echoes through the stone arches of the cathedral 

As I walked about the great building I could hear Ensemble Vocale d' Avignon in rehearsal 

Where the mighty Rhone river meets the Mediterranean Sea its silt has created a spreading triangle of wild marshes  the Camargue 

A natural landscape which seems at first to be fit only for flamingos egrets and ducks 

but look closer 

and you can see the hand of man 

This unique area of salt marshes reeds and wind has a very special type of livestock farming black fighting bulls the kind that primitive men used to worship for their power and their bravery and they breed them here for the ring 

But the bulls are not killed

The ones who take the chances are these young men in white who try to grab a ring from the bull 's horn

The bull always lives to fight another day 

For most of the year the marshes of the Camargue are left to nature 

Each spring after the migrant birds have arrived others appear on a different kind of pilgrimage and they head to the little village on the southern edge of the marshes Les Saintes Maries de la Mer the Saint Marys of the Sea 

This tiny village is world-famous as the shrine of all travelling gypsies

Each May thousands arrive from all over Europe and beyond to give thanks and to worship their patron saints Mary Jacoby sister of the Virgin Mary and Mary Salome mother of John the Evangelist 

Inside the medieval church is a sacred statue of the Marys sailing in a little wooden boat how they came to be here 

The legend tells us that after the crucifixion the two saints and their Egyptian servant Sarah were set adrift by the Jews of Jerusalem in a boat with no sails no oars and no food

But with the divine protection of the Lord the boat was guided ashore to the foot of the church walls 

Of course over the years the pilgrims have improved this story so that the boat contained Mary Magdalene Lazarus and his sister Martha and various other saints and the whole lot were greeted by Saint Trophemus 

The reason that this is such a sacred place is because the two Marys remained in the Camargue with Sarah the servant and it is she who has become the most important person for the gypsies 

After her miraculous escape from the sea she wandered throughout the Mediterranean region and the gypsies identify with her nomadic existence and her life as an oppressed servant 

Today many thousands are heading into the town for worship and celebration 

Representatives of many different nations camp in the town though most are French and Spanish 

The pilgrimage to Les Saintes Maries de la Mer was established over a thousand years ago

Gradually it has been adopted by the gypsies as their special feast

I asked Beatrice  a French gypsy why this event is so special

It 's recorded that there was a chapel here before the ninth century when the first stone church was built

Here it is claimed were discovered the graves of the two Marys

The stones on which their bones lay are preserved in the crypt

For the gypsies they have miraculous powers of healing 

On the walls of the church are some delightful votive paintings showing miracles attributed to the two saints

In the crypt praying pilgrims queue all day for a chance to kiss the icon of Sarah

The heat of the candles is almost suffocating but here is found true adoration 

The little marsh village hums with anticipation

Each family group tells tales of their travels their ancestors their hopes and fears

The lives of gypsies are still no easier today than in the past

The men are proud never showing weakness and their music reveals their passion for life 

Accompanied by his son and grandson the gypsies ' great guitar hero Manuel Arenas 

There are thousands here today and the atmosphere is electric

Everything must go right as the gypsies are naturally a very superstitious people

Most of them are not conventional churchgoers yet they still consider themselves to be Christians

Just once a year many show their allegiance to the faith for this is their most important day 

Today is the twenty-fourth of May and the local streets have been taken over by the gypsies who are about to parade the icon of Sarah from the church down to the sea from where she came 

The icon is dressed as for a wedding with many layers of silk

They believe that every moment of the procession can be interpreted as a portent of the year to come 

The procession leads to the beach where Sarah is carried down to the sea

The excitement boils over

To protect Sarah from the crowd the local men of the  cowboys with poles form a barrier

But it doesn't stop people surging forward into the sea 

After Sarah has been presented to the sea most of the gypsies pack up and leave 

The authorities are strict as the local people have their own festival to celebrate but they 'll do that next year 

Next day the feast of Mary Jacoby another procession takes place but this is organised by the local folk

Ladies are dressed in nineteenth-century costumes

the men of the  wear Proven&ccedille;al print shirts and velvet riding jackets

Then they more or less repeat the procession of the previous day

The statue of the two Marys is taken from the church towards the seaside for their blessing 

There 's been much criticism that this has become another tourist attraction

yet were not pilgrims in the past the same as tourists

People come to see

Even non-believers are curious

They too want to feel some effect 

Everyone takes part just by being there so the tradition is upheld and the two Marys are still recognised regardless of what the crowds may believe 

Watching from a distance it was a strangely moving event 

The pilgrimage to Les Saintes Maries de la Mer began about nineteen hundred years ago and still they come 

As homage was paid to the saints I thought about all the people who 've been attracted here since the Romans first brought water and therefore civilisation to the area the early Christian struggles the grand popes and their palace and today the travelling folk who come to venerate Sarah with whom they identify and holiday tourists like me 

For centuries countless thousands of people have arrived in magical Provence for the sunshine and the quality of life that it provides

They also find little known stories and folk tales of Christian saints  and though history and legend are tightly woven together the truth is always there to see

As Jesus said man cannot live by bread alone

People always need something more than just the material comforts of life 

It 's called faith

I believe in the crucifixion as a fact and not as a tableau in an altarpiece 

I believe that he was crucified dead and buried and that we do not give enough thought to this 

Knowing the triumph that is to come we hurry on and do not care to give one Saturday 's contemplation to the moment of the failure of Christianity and so to the full range of its achievement as a success

Jesus died and it was a very nasty way to die indeed 

As a journalist for more than forty years I 've had my fill of executions

I 've seen a Prime Minister hanged very slowly from a low tripod

I 've seen a sodomite gassed

I 've seen a row of black marketeers shot  and I thought I would spare you the details which were always messy 

The worst thing really is the way authority tries to look stately on these occasions and ends up looking ridiculous and embarrassed 

How different it all is from the impartial punishment which the advocates of capital punishment imagine 

The only exception is the old-fashioned bloodbath the public execution where we are all animals together and a roar goes up as the axe flashes and the heads held high with closed eyes and parted lips

Ah that 's the real spirit of execution

Unless you 've been there and felt yourself part of the lynch mob it is a mere anecdote at second hand 

This has always seemed to me the essence of the reporter 's task to convey what it is like to be there 

Too many journalists nowadays sound as if they are writing their account from the same news agency tape 

In any case we have to rely on sources even more remote for our account of the Crucifixion though they are remarkably full and varied for so ancient an event 

They have been overlaid with an atmosphere of formality and ceremony which takes us out of the realm of journalism and into the worlds of art and symbolism and theology 

Because we know what comes next we find it almost impossible to concentrate on what the act of crucifixion itself was really like 

But to everyone involved at the time it was the end of the story of one reality 













Perhaps the main point I want to make about the death of Jesus is that it was not only extremely painful and protracted but it was deliberately meant to be utterly final 

It was a form of execution reserved by the Romans almost exclusively for the terrorisation of the slave population and the deterrence of treason and it was particularly dreadful in Jewish eyes

Dreadful shameful and disgusting

You will recall how Saint Paul says we proclaim Christ crucified even though this is a stumbling block to the Jews





The reference here is to the exhibition of the dead body not to a lingering execution

But the point is as Paul makes perfectly clear that the gibbet is defiling

and it 's interesting that the ritual described by the Gospels shows a nice awareness of the necessary details of burial 

The great classical barrister Cicero described the cross as that scourge the most repulsive and horrible form of death

A Roman citizen was supposed to be exempt from crucifixion

hence you find most of the early writers referring to Christians as mad or depraved for worshipping an alleged god who had suffered the death reserved for the lowest form of criminals 

A folly to the Greeks says Saint Paul where it was obvious to the Greeks that the gods were immortal 

It was sheer foolishness to try and sell them a god who even if he had risen again from the tomb had allowed himself such undignified exposure 

What Paul is saying then is that whether you are trying to sell the good news of Jesus to the Jews or the Greeks you have got a pretty unsaleable item on your hands a god who is accursed and unclean a god who is actually dead 

Paul and the early Christians were trying to market a revolutionary upside-down sort of god

Instead of a supreme king in glory he had first to be accepted as the lowest kind of slave butchered like an animal 

Christians today tend to take it for granted that we can easily take that as read

But I am suggesting that in every way it is almost insuperable and the fact that it was overcome in those first two or three centuries of faith is something that we must accept even if we cannot entirely understand it 

Crucifixion was only the climax of a way of death

First came the torture  the scourging and mocking the forced carrying of one 's own heavy cross or maybe a cross-piece for which Jesus was evidently too weak to complete the course

Then the nailing to the cross 

We know now how it was done and it wasn't the way it usually appears in the paintings 

That mysterious relic the holy shroud of Turin though a pious fraud I 'm afraid has got it right

Two nails through the wrists  not the hands because nails through the palms of the hands would not have supported the weight of the body 

A Frenchman called Barbet did some rather gruesome experiments in the nineteen thirties demonstrating this 

In the same way two other experimenters found out that if you simply suspended the body from the wrists with an additional nail through the ankles it was then extremely difficult to breathe in and out and that the victim in this case experimented themselves using rope lashings rather than nails

The victims began to lose consciousness after twelve to twenty minutes  which was not at all the drawn-out agony which the Roman executioner sought 

The Romans were not normally interested in this quicker death as that Christ underwent

They commonly provided an additional means of support either a kind of footrest or a small wooden seat no more than a peg really upon which the victim squirmed in search of a rest that was no rest 

The chances are that Jesus received a fairly orthodox execution

for we are told that his two fellow victims who presumably had been able to sit back and avoid suffocating themselves quickly had to have their legs broken so as to force their weight out onto their arms and thus hasten death before sunset whereas Jesus already weak from loss of blood was unable to keep himself on the wooden peg and was dead 

The spear in the side proves that and if there was one thing the execution squad could 've been relied upon to certify it was that its victims were dead 

Now I have read half a dozen books arguing that in some way Jesus was not dead that the haste of the occasion enabled his followers to revive him 

But there are so many reasons why that will not stand up  chief among them that it is not what the four Gospels allow

and the Gospels are incomparably older than any other version

They 're confused

They are not sure what did happen

But their very lack of neatness is convincing

Above all Paul whose job it was originally to expose the Christian racket and who must have heard and investigated all stories about it Paul was more convinced than anyone of its truth 

It is not my business to write the next chapter of this story and perhaps it is just as well for I do not pretend to know exactly what happened

But that something happened something extraordinary which compelled the belief of the early Christians against all probability that I must believe 

And I believe it all the more because of the unpleasant fleshly facts which I have recounted 

One reason why and I tell it with some unwillingness because in comparison with the suffering of Jesus it is trivial  it is that I am in constant pain myself

Nobody is maliciously torturing me

it 's just one of the pains that flesh is heir to

I 've been fitted with a little electric box which is supposed to deaden it not I 'm afraid very successfully

No it 's not at all the same as being crucified

But it is a reminder that pain can be the one reality in one 's life

It can be the only thing that anyone even the Son of Man can think about

It is perhaps the ultimate

Is it hell 

I don't know but I do know that at the end as one gets near the edge  the body has a merciful way of switching off the sensations it cannot stand of narrowing down its sensations to the essential 

I have had the feeling of being crushed under a rock till I could see only one crack of light and that was the love of God

The absolute certainty when everything else has been taken from me that God loved me 

And then of course things rightened again and all sort of bodily inconveniences came back again one by one

You can't call it the sensation of having died

but it has been a comfort to me ever since

and I 've liked to think that round the corner of supreme agony there lay waiting for Jesus that same assurance that in the end and in spite of it all his Father loved him  and all manner of things would be well 

The Garden of Gethsemane is maybe the darkest place in the Bible

It 's where Christ is betrayed by Judas 's kiss

It 's where he accepts that death is coming soon

It 's where he understands that the last of his life on earth is upon him

For anyone here and now looking for a moment to grasp the essence of it all here it is the dark night of the soul

I think it 's where we can understand that the world of human frailties and weaknesses is about to give way to something else only half understood and mysterious certainly but out there somewhere nonetheless

After the last supper the disciples go there to the garden with Jesus

In John 's gospel it 's preceded by the so called farewell discourses when the disciples are presented with the mystery that 's going to unravel for them















They have no idea what 's going to happen

They 're stumbling around in the dark

They all insist that they 'd never deny Jesus and Peter who 's going to do it three times before much longer is adamant about it

We 're at the moment when there 's about to be a struggle between the earthly and the divine and that 's why this episode illuminates a world that we know

After all the point about Christ 's passion is not just that it is something which leads to good news but that it 's a struggle

There 's no puff of smoke

no magic trick deals with all the problems and people who look at it in that way seem to me to be missing the difficulties that matter and have to be faced

This is Jesus struggling with the knowledge of what 's coming as a man

The last supper is over

They go out into the moonlight on the Mount of Olives up the Kidron Valley that still runs through Jerusalem and they gather together



So this is the submission to the will of God not easily but in anguish and meanwhile the disciples aren't crowded around crouching in some kind of reverence or trying to help

They 've all fallen asleep

Luke offers the excuse that they 're worn out by grief

Matthew and Mark don't

Mark has them jerking themselves awake and then slipping under again three times while their master to whom they 've been swearing a loyalty that won't die has been facing the inevitability of his death as a man

Voltaire that eighteenth century scourge of religion used to refuse to let his friends discuss atheism in front of the servants 

Unbelief was one thing between consenting intellectuals in private but if it spread through society morality would collapse

he said



For the greater part of human history religion has been seen as the foundation of morality 

In Dostoevsky 's words if God did not exist all would be permitted 

But this belief must seem to us now decidedly strange

Whether or not we believe in God we inhabit a culture in which religious teachings are marginal to many people 's moral choices

When did we last hear in a television discussion or a newspaper editorial the simple assertion that something was wrong because God or religious doctrine said so 

Even a religious leader who said this would nowadays be branded a fundamentalist

Our moral language has been effectively secularised

Religion enters our conversations obliquely and with embarrassment

Yet society survives

The world continues uninterrupted on its course

What 's hard for us to understand in retrospect is how anyone could have thought otherwise 

But they did believers and unbelievers alike

No one more so than the man who more than anyone severed morality from religion Friedrich Nietzsche 

But he didn't believe that there could be a smooth transition to a secular morality

On the contrary there 'd have to be a transvaluation of all values a complete redefinition of our mental universe

It was necessary

But it would be a nightmare

And in a famous passage Nietzsche imagines the speech of the madman who announces to a secular world that God is dead and we have killed him 







That 's what it would feel like to lose the divine foundations of our moral world

Within a few years of writing those lines Nietzsche went insane and shortly thereafter died 

What is it these thinkers saw that we fail to see 

How were religion and morality associated in the first place

And how then being thought inseparable did they come to be separated 

Above all what happened to that predicted but strangely invisible tragedy Voltaire 's collapse of the social order Nietzsche 's infinite nothing 

The traditional connection between God and human goodness was straightforward

Revelation was legislation

Heaven had revealed what 's right and what 's wrong

And if it hadn't done so how would we know

It isn't that we 'd lack an answer

It 's that we 'd have too many answers

We 'd arrive at the situation described at the end of the Book of Judges each person doing that which is right in his own eyes 

What 's more the lawgiver was also the law enforcer

God 's existence guaranteed that the righteous would be rewarded and that evil would be repaid with evil

This answered the question that so troubled Plato

Why be good if you can get away with being bad

An all knowing all powerful God ensured that there would be no tax evaders in the kingdom of heaven

So religion underwrote the terms of morality

The knowledge of God led to virtue

And the Day of Judgement put a heavy price on vice 

But for the past several centuries that view has come increasingly under attack for reasons that now seem quite clear

God may well have revealed a moral code but it turned out to be a different moral code for Catholics and Protestants and Muslims and Jews

If we 're to sort out what human beings as such should do we 'll need something other than revelation 

Besides which as Kant suggested if you try to get people to be good by rewarding them if they are and punishing them if they aren't you don't actually succeed in getting them to be good

you merely succeed in getting them to be pragmatic

Then again though this had been noted long before by Abraham and Jeremiah and Job the view that the world was ruled by God on the principle of justice was difficult to reconcile with the facts

Evil prospered

The righteous for the most part suffered

And virtue had to be content with being its own reward 

For people of faith this only served to show how inscrutable divine justice was

But for those who brought less commitment to bear on the question it was difficult to see how inscrutable justice wasn't another name for highly scrutable injustice 

None of these considerations was conclusive in itself 

But by the seventeenth century other factors were at play 

There was the morally ambivalent record of religion itself its holy wars and persecutions 

There was the rise of science as a competing source of knowledge to revelation 

And perhaps above all there was that crucial transition by which in Lionel Trilling 's phrase men became individuals 

It 's impossible to pinpoint when and why the first person singular moved into independent orbit

but we can detect significant moments 

When writers embarked on the new literary form of autobiography when Rembrandt started painting his long series of self portraits when Shakespeare has Polonius say to Laertes this above all to thine own self be true the idea of the individual as a reality in itself apart from its social roles was beginning to emerge

Whatever the cause the consequence was clear

The independent self was about to change the course of moral thought 

At some point the revolutionary idea is born that religion far from enhancing our moral development significantly obstructs it

It keeps us in a state of dependency 

It takes away from us the need through trial and error to find things out for ourselves

We become restless with a demanding father who dictates the terms of our existence

Religion makes us moral children and if we 're to reach maturity we 'll have to do without it 

This idea given its fullest expression by Freud lies at the heart of three centuries of moral reflection in the slow movement from virtue to authenticity from morality as something objectively present in nature and society to something authored by the sovereign self 

It begins with Spinoza excommunicated by the Jewish community of Amsterdam in sixteen fifty-six an outsider in a community of outsiders 

Spinoza saw all religions as human constructs

The legislation of the Bible wasn't God 's law but Moses ' invention to turn a group of slaves into a nation

This then he said was the object of the ceremonial law that men should do nothing of their own free will but should always act under external authority 

In that sentence we hear the distinctive modern accent of the individual no longer shaped by but now set over and against religious commands 

Its echoes are taken up and amplified by Kant who insists that being moral can't be a matter of submission to an external authority

it must be something that we impose on ourselves in what he called autonomy 

Hegel goes further in seeing the Hebrew Bible as the product of a slave mentality

And with an air of Samson pulling the temple down on the Philistines Nietzsche demolishes the whole structure of Judeo-Christian ethics as a pious fraud the bonds placed by the weak upon the strong 

Not all these figures were moral revolutionaries

Kant in particular had a high regard for traditional morality and believed that he was merely underpinning it with more solid foundations 

But radical consequences were to follow

Once morality was divorced from a theistic vision of man 's place in the universe it became hard to see how any particular idea of the moral life had precedence over any other 

What could provide beyond what we are and what we want to be that further dimension of what we ought to be 

Science couldn't do so because it now examined causes not ultimate purposes

nor could anthropology because all it revealed was the immense variety of pictures different societies have had of the good 

The voice of God which had hitherto given societies their most compelling ethical visions had now been ruled ultra vires 

And so however conservative their intention the ultimate effect of these philosophies was to weaken the idea of any moral authority beyond the self 

A fateful process had been set in motion

This was translated in British philosophy into a sharp distinction between facts and values and in French existentialism into Sartre 's declaration that human existence has no essence 

Within three centuries morality had moved from out there to in here

It had become a matter of individual will or preference or emotion or decision

To suppose that moral judgements could be inferred from facts about God or human nature was to have the wrong ideas about language or reason or human freedom

Certainly moral philosophers could no longer tell us what to do

Nobody could do that

At most they could clarify our choices and summon us to have the courage to make them 

This was bound in the end to have political implications 

So long as moral values were seen to be out there in divine commandments or nature or society it made sense to assume a strong relationship between morality and law

Law enforced objective values 

But once the idea took hold that morality was a matter of individual choice it became hard to see how it could be legislated

You might still talk about a moral consensus but that hardly justified making illegal what a minority of the population sincerely believed was permissible

That would be what John Stuart Mill called the tyranny of the majority

Instead so Mill argued the only ground for making something illegal was that it caused harm to others

And by the nineteen sixties that case seemed irresistible and in Britain and elsewhere homosexuality and abortion were legalised 

It takes a long time for the speculations of a philosophical avant garde to become the taken for granted commonplaces of ordinary life but by now they 've done so

The orthodoxies of our time are that morality is a private affair a matter of personal choice  and that the state must be morally neutral 

But this raises a fundamental question 

namely does morality in any significant sense exist any more 

Put this way the question might seem absurd

After all we still use the language of morality

We speak of right and wrong good and bad justice and rights 

But these are all words which were once thought to refer to objective principles and it 's just these that we now believe don't exist 

The use of words like right and wrong suggest that there are impersonal standards by which our choices may be judged 

But if there are no such standards only choices then moral language becomes an anomaly

Some recent writers have suggested just this that our moral vocabulary is a vestige of an earlier age and can no longer be used coherently 

Perhaps this suggestion isn't absurd 

Pick up any contemporary book on how to live your life 

It will begin by asking you to define your goals

It will teach you to organise your time and relationships to achieve them

You 'll learn assertiveness so as not to be inhibited by other people 's agendas

Missing will be any suggestion of right and wrong 

What 's right will be what works for you

The great moralist of our time turned out to be Ernest Hemingway when he said what 's moral is what you feel good after and what 's immoral is what you feel bad after

In such an environment morality becomes a matter of technique alone learning how to reach our objectives or achieve self expression 

We no longer talk of virtues but of values

And values are tapes

We play on the Walkman of the mind any tune we choose so long as it doesn't disturb others 

One of the great motifs of moral thought in the last century  has been the crucial importance of private space the territory in which we 're simply free to be ourselves

Rarely in human history has the idea of an obligation imposed on us by others seemed so constricting and suffocating

And this has profound implications for our understanding of a whole range of issues 

Marriage has become not a covenant but a contract without binding force beyond the consent of the partners

Families have moved towards more contractual relationships between parents and children 

Sexuality is a matter of freely chosen lifestyle

Abortion is the right of a woman over her own body

Euthanasia is the right of each of us over our own lives 

What 's missing in each of these cases is the idea once thought to be definitive of morality that there can be obligations which constrain our choices and duties that place a limit on desire 

It 's not that we 've stopped thinking morally altogether

It 's that our moral imagination is bounded by three central themes autonomy equality and rights the values that allow each of us to be whatever we choose

The central character of our moral drama is no longer the saint or the hero but the free self unencumbered by attachments unobligated by circumstance freely negotiating its temporary contracts with others

Frank Sinatra singing I did it my way 

As a result much of what we used to do as moral beings has come to seem repressive even a denial of the human condition 

To make moral judgements is to be judgemental

Calling a way of life wrong is an assault on the integrity or authenticity of others

The most fundamental of all parental wishes  to educate our children in our own morality is indoctrination and a denial of their free development 

We know that not all choices are wise but we 're reluctant to let that fact serve as the basis for a moral conclusion

Since before dawn today Britain 's forces have been in action in the Gulf 

Their skill and courage has already been tested 

Tonight I want to explain to you why they are there and what this conflict is about 

Our troops are part of an international force

It is drawn from many countries 

It is acting under the authority of the United Nations  and its purpose is to end Saddam Hussein 's ruthless occupation of Kuwait 

He invaded without justification 

His army has conducted itself without mercy 

If such brutality and aggression are rewarded with success  then we are all at risk 

If you appease a bully you pay for it later  and you often pay more dearly 

We did not want a conflict

I need hardly tell you that

We have tried hard to avoid it

We have given Saddam Hussein every opportunity to withdraw

Time and again the United Nations has called upon him to leave Kuwait 

In the patient diplomacy of the past five months leaders from around the world have sought peace  and then sought it again  but Saddam Hussein has chosen war

He has rejected every attempt to reach a peaceful solution

He has rebuffed even the Secretary General of the United Nations 

At the United Nations the world agreed that Iraq must withdraw or be driven out of Kuwait 

We applied sanctions to make that point clear 

We refused to trade with Iraq 

Those sanctions made life harsher for Saddam 's people  but he was not a man to be influenced by their suffering 

Then the world set him a deadline 

Free Kuwait

we said

or we will have to free it from you 

but Saddam Hussein has rejected all appeals 

He has defied the United Nations 

He has increased his force in Kuwait 

He has tortured and killed those who opposed him 

He has tried to wipe Kuwait off the very map of the Middle East 

For our part we the rest of the world have acted with enormous restraint 

Time and again we warned him  and we offered him this promise 

If he would withdraw his invading army from Kuwait and return them to Iraq he would not be attacked 

Saddam has chosen instead to defy the world 

The deadline passed on January the fifteenth and still he refused to withdraw 

That is why we and our partners are now facing up to our responsibility 

It is to compel him to obey the United Nations 

We could not delay any longer 

Delay would have increased the risk to our troops out there in the Gulf 

Delay would have made their task more difficult  and delay would have extended the terrible sufferings of the people of Kuwait 

Our aims are clear 

They have been set out for all to see by the United Nations Security Council 

First we must get Iraq out of Kuwait right out of Kuwait 

Second we must restore Kuwait 's legitimate government 

And third we must uphold the authority of the United Nations 

We and our allies want nothing more than that 

We are not seeking to dismember Iraq 

We have no intention of imposing our choice of government on Iraq 

We are simply doing what the United Nations said should be done 

We are acting with the authority of the United Nations and on behalf of the whole world 

I will not offer you rash promises about how quickly this can be done 

The operation on which we have embarked involves danger and sacrifice  but I am confident that it will succeed and we know it is a battle which has to be fought 

On Tuesday members of Parliament gave the government their overwhelming support 

One of the biggest parliamentary majorities in recent history supported action to enforce the decisions of the United Nations 

It is a just cause 

And it is right that we in Britain should play our part 

I take no pleasure in this conflict 

but I do know what we are doing is right 

Our nation has been through many trials in the past  but when as now right and justice have been on our side  we have prevailed 

The military operation must go on  on until the decisions of the United Nations are enforced 

Then we can start searching again and searching hard for lasting solutions to the problems of the area 

We must try to work out security arrangements for the future so that these terrible events are never repeated  and we shall I promise you  bring our own forces back home just as soon as it is safe to do so 

It is to those men and women serving our country in the Middle East  that my thoughts go out most tonight 

and to all of their families here at home 

To you I know this is not a distant war

It is a close and ever present anxiety 

I was privileged to meet many of our servicemen and women in the Gulf last week 

Their professionalism is outstanding 

their confidence impressive 

and their courage undoubted 

You can be proud of them very proud 

Each one of them has Britain 's wholehearted support  and the prayers of all of us for their safe return home  and our prayers are also for you their families  who carry so much of the burden of Saddam 's war 

We are no less proud of you 

Goodnight and God bless

Since Iraq invaded Kuwait the whole world through the United Nations made two things plain 

First Kuwait must be freed from Iraqi occupation

Second  that should be achieved if at all possible without resort to military force 

Repeated attempts were therefore rightly made to fulfil the purposes of the United Nations without conflict 

They didn't succeed 

And whatever other reasons can be given one thing is absolutely clear 

The major cause of the failure of peaceful efforts was Saddam Hussein 's complete refusal to give any indication that he would accept the rule of international law 

Saddam Hussein has never cared about the suffering of his people 

Anyone in his country who might advise him to accept the will of the United Nations and to avoid disaster would have been executed

Protests about his policy or even complaints about its results would have been punished with death 

Meanwhile Kuwait was loo looted

Kuwaitis and other people were being beaten raped and murdered  and still  if there had been any evidence of willingness on the part of Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait the war now being waged against him would have been preventable 

Tragically  it was not to be 

Saddam Hussein has now to be driven out by the force authorised by the United Nations 

It is essential for all of our sakes that the authority of the United Nations is upheld 

Its ability to be the major instrument for international security is now at stake 

If for any reason  the United Nations did not prevail Saddam 's aggression would have won  and if that were to occur all people who rightly yearn for peace in the world would get less of it not more 

That 's particularly true of the Middle East 

When Saddam Hussein has been expelled and Kuwait is again independent  the world community through the United Nations must focus firmly on helping the peoples of the Middle East to gain a just and enduring settlement 

In the Gulf area now the men and women of our forces are facing great danger 

They are showing and they will show great bravery and great skill 

They will do more than their duty in making this world a safer place 

We strongly support them  and as we do  we know that for many people in our country the war which our forces are now fighting is not only a matter of international principle or great and grim world events 

it is a matter of deep personal concern about the safety and the wellbeing of loved ones now engaged on our behalf in military action 

Those people most of all need to know that the conflict is in pursuit of just ends 

I can only say to them  that I am sure that  if this task was not done the world would be open to the prospect of greater catastrophe and greater disorder 

The purpose of this war is to enforce international law

it is to uphold the rights of nations to be independent and of people to live without fear 

It is in that spirit  that the men and women of our forces and our allies are going to win the war 

And it is in that spirit that we must build the peace that follows 

Good evening

Building a top-class economy a world-class economy  will take time effort resources  and consistency of purpose and policy 

So much is evident 

But the fact that full achievement is by definition a long term task  should not be used by anyone  as a means of denying the necessity of undertaking it  or of delaying the start 

The long term starts here

Before the Ribble Valley by-election  there was some debate as to whether the poll tax was in its death throes  or whether it would be revived at least in part

The message is now crystal clear 

The poll tax must go 

The people of this country are not prepared to tolerate to tolerate a tax which was so blatantly unfair  with an elderly couple on limited income finding themselves with the same bills as far wealthier people 

The size of bills they were expected to pay for their local services  is clearly exorbitant 

and many simply cannot cope 

And we can all see that this tax is virtually impossible to collect from some people  so that those who do pay are being asked to pay even more to cover the cost of defaulters

This is quite wrong 

There the agreement ends 

What to put in its place has been debated long and hard 

Let us be honest about one thing

Whatever is put in its place will not be universally popular 

There is no such thing as a popular tax 

But we have to pay for our local services 

and we have to be sure local authorities are using the money  efficiently and wisely

not always the case I 'm afraid particularly in the case of some of the London boroughs 

The S D P has always had a clear policy on local government 

We believe a combination of proportional representation  and local income tax  would enable local people to decide what services they want  and how much they want to pay for them 

Local income tax would wor would work like ordinary income tax  where the wea the wealthy pay a higher rate those on modest incomes pay a moderate amount  whilst those managing on very limited incomes  would pay nothing at all

Whatever the chosen system we must make sure that the bills dropping through our letter box  are fair reasonable and affordable 

I believe there is another important consideration here 

Some services should be of a national standard  and are too important to be subject to the annual fiasco of cuts  we have seen in our Town Halls in recent weeks

Vital services like the police and fire service should I believe  be funded nationally

The education of our children  is just too important to be threatened every time the local authority 's books don't balance 

I have been inundated with letters from head teachers school governors and parents  about their fears over what will happen to education  if Greenwich is poll tax capped again 

And that problem wouldn't be resolved if we went back to a property tax like the rates 

We were rate capped then 

Whatever the rights and wrongs of the poll tax the rates or whatever is put in its place  education should not suffer

With the local financial management of schools  they do have a lot more independence 

Let us fund these schools and our teachers from our national taxes  and not leave them at the mercy of the vagaries of local government

Mr Chairman uh Mr  Opposer uh ladies and gentlemen 

In eighteen twenty-seven  Sir Robert Peel after whom this establishment is named  told the House of Commons that owing to the changes which had taken place in society society had outgrown uh police institutions and the time had come for a new model 

That model became the Metropolitan Police 

In nineteen fifty-nine  R A Butler  told the House of Commons that public confidence in the police was declining  and that he was going to set up a Royal Commission on the police because he said  without public cooperation  and the fullest confidence in the system our police cannot effectively operate

The result of his enquiry were the Reforms of the Police Act of nineteen sixty-four 

Today not only public confidence but police confidence in the system is seeping away

There 's a whiff of decay in the air  and the British people have an intuition in these matters 

When they see fair play or justice being threatened they withdraw cooperation  from poll tax gatherers and police officers alike

Less cooperation means less detection of crime fewer convictions of the guilty and further damage to the social fabric

Powerless minorities seek reform through riot whilst others go further

Police become cynical standards fall they turn inwards and loyalties become distorted

The last Royal Commission based the present system on what they described as a political idea of immense practical value namely the partnership between central and local government in the administration of affairs 

Since then the uh local government has been reformed drastically  weakened some would say and the partnership has become unstable

The Audit Commission looking at the police recently commented and I quote





And what of those who have to serve this system

Not all is well here either

The public have been fair

We have the best paid the most numerous the best equipped and the most powerful police in our history 

yet recently the Parliamentary Home Affairs Committee reported its lack of confidence in the system for preparing and selecting senior ranks

Public opinion polls and the British Crime Survey show significant falls of public satisfaction 

Police have sought to redefine and clarify their role in this maelstrom  for the police system continues to move towards the law enforcement model and away from preventive policing 

Again the waxing powers of the State and of policing are seen to threaten liberties which in this country lie unprotected by a Bill of Rights

The reputation of our criminal justice system has been damaged recently by investigative malpractice and Lord Scarman voices public disquiet and concern when he says we simply cannot go on like this

There are difficulties with our police disciplinary system

for more and more aggrieved members of the public turn to the civil courts for redress 

Last year over half a million pounds was paid out for false arrest and malicious prosecution in London alone 

Therefore it is necessary to turn to reform 

The primary object of a new police might be couched in the following or similar terms

quote

the protection of human rights fundamental freedoms and the institutions of democratic government

unquote 

The roots of a new police should be firmly grounded in local communities at district council or London borough level  with community councils in the cities and parish councils in the rural areas having consultative status

There should be three main divisions of police 

One service police locally based 

Two support police regionally based

Three a national police bureau to deal with national and international issues including the Europe after nineteen ninety-two

The existing national functions of the Metropolitan Police should be hived off to the new national police bureau leaving the Metropolitan Police to police London 

Now other reforms should include judicial supervision of criminal investigations into serious crime  a code of civil remedies in cases where damage through police negligence or malpractice has occurred a completely independent police and public complaints authority and a revised police discipline code and a new Police Act to define the hazy issue of police accountability

Now given all these reforms or something like them the police would be entitled to expect  or to demand even the fullest public cooperation without which the system doesn't work 

I ask you to support the motion

Mr Chairman Mr Proposer

I oppose the motion 

and I do so on the basis that  as a senior police officer I have  for the last seventeen years been involved in the organisation  and the management of police forces in various parts of England and Wales

I have served in rural and urban areas comprising a variety of political backgrounds 

And I conclude  that the public can have every confidence in our present system of policing 

Mr Chairman I smell no decay

I see no lack of confidence in the police service

nor do I detect anything hazy about our accountability

nor do I find any nervousness abroad

But let me dwell for a moment upon the system  which divides the responsibility for policing in this country  between three key players 

There is firstly a police authority  made up of elected councillors and magistrates with a statutory duty  to provide an efficient force and to fund forty-nine per cent of its budget

The Chief Constable is responsible for the operational running of his force  answerable to the police authority who hires him and which can if certain conditions prevail  fire him 

The Home Secretary who provides general guidance and advice

He provides fifty-one per cent of our finances and he maintains a common standard of efficiency  through the offices of the Inspectors of Constabulary 

I accept of course that the Metropolitan Police has a structure which is unique to London 

The tripartite system is a fine example of the checks and balances that each has upon the other  the art of the compromise  the art of the reasonable person behaving in a reasonable manner which is geared to policing vastly different communities  many with their own traditions  their own way of life and in my particular case their own language 

I would suggest that such conflicts as have occurred in the past within police authorities have done so because the vital element of reasonableness was absent

and often people were more concerned with the pursuit of individual power than the wellbeing of the society they were serving

Such difficulties should not of themselves be sufficient reason to seek to fundamentally change our way of policing which has served us well over the last a hundred and fifty years and I would suggest  has stood the test of time

We need to remember that the vast majority of forces in this country  carry out their responsibilities in an efficient  and sensible manner

We hear little of the day to day successes but only of the odd occasion when conflict arises

Such isolated incidents prompt immediate calls for change but this does not in my view  justify the contention that the public cannot have confidence in the system 

It would Mr Chairman be idle of me to stand here and seek to ignore the issues of dissatisfaction in policing standards which feature in the media  from time to time

It would be totally unappropriate to mention specific cases  but recent legislation by way of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act has addressed the substantial areas of dissatisfaction

The ready access of prisoners to legal advice  the tape recording of interviews  and more recently the videoing of interviews will go a long way to dispel the concerns  often voiced by defence counsel during trials

The Labour Zidder scheme ensures unlimited and random access  to persons held in police custody

The introduction of the Independent Police Complaints Authority  with its wide powers of intervention and supervision of the investigation of complaints can but reassure the doubting public 

The introduction of the Crown Prosecution Service separated the investigative from the prosecution process and this ensures that only  those cases which meet the Attorney General 's criteria are prosecuted in our criminal courts 

So much Mr Chairman for the legislative changes of recent times which have been introduced to ensure confidence in our policing systems

What of the British policeman himself 

We have never before attracted the quality of recruits that we see entering the service today 

The percentage of graduates has greatly increased and the variety of backgrounds of the officers ensures a representative spread of the community as a whole

The restructured and reformed training systems  which seek to inculcate at an early stage the confidence and the exercise of discretion which produces I would say a more thoughtful and caring officer attuned to the needs of his changing community 

In serving the public Mr Chairman we must identify their needs and concerns 

Formal and informal contacts from neighbourhood watch schemes to community town and district councils ensures a channel of close communication 

Our specialist teams dealing with the investigation of child abuse work closely with social services

Our involvement in victim support schemes and our support for the Victims ' Charter clearly displays our community commitment as does our cooperation in the multi-agency approach to crime prevention

The police service from constable to chief officer recognises the importance of the quality of service that we must deliver to our public 

We have confidence that our commitment will ensure that the British public can have every confidence in our present system of policing 

I beg to oppose

Owls are one of the most beautiful of all birds 

strange secret night-hunters flying on silent wings beneath the stars 

One of the loveliest of them all is the barn owl with its grey gold and white plumage  and a charming Oriental-looking face 

For centuries these birds have been admired by farmers and country people 

They were given quaint names such as Old Hushwing  Jenny Hoolet and Cherubim

And as early as the seventeenth century special owl windows were built into barns  to encourage them to nest there and so of course rid the farm of rats and mice 

That was at a time when barn owls were plentiful 

But how many of you have seen one recently 

Sadly Old Hushwing is no longer part of the great meadows of our countryside 

One of the problems of course is that the new agricultural methods have decreased grassland areas which were the birds ' feeding grounds  and removed the old barns and hollow trees in which they could roost and nest 

Barn owls now have to hunt their prey along the grassy verges of roads  so as many as five thousand birds are killed by cars and lorries in a year 

A recent survey by the conservation charity called The Hawk and Owl Trust showed that throughout Britain and Ireland the owl population had decreased by seventy per cent  in the last fifty years 

But The Hawk and Owl Trust acted quickly  setting up a most imaginative countrywide project called the Barn Owl Conservation Network 

This is run almost entirely by volunteers who  with the landowners and the farmers find the sites where the barn owls are now living 

Then they work out how each site can be linked up to the next  by a corridor of grassland hedgerow and waterway 

The landowners and farmers along the corridor maintain a narrow strip of chemical-free grassland where the birds can hunt  thus linking owl family to owl family and forming a network away from the worst hazards of modern life 

In only two years this has met with enormous success  in England and Scotland where barn owls can now be seen feeding in these new habitats  and what 's more important breeding in carefully selected nestboxes  which are placed where the buildings and hollow trees no longer exist 

In the three hundred boxes  that the Trust has already provided one thousand two hundred baby owls have been reared by their parents 

But by this time next year a quarter of the traditional nesting sites may have disappeared

So new nestboxes for barn owls are urgently needed 

They 're about as big as tea chests and they cost thirty pounds each and the owls love them 

For centuries these wonderful birds have been our neighbours and friends 

Surely now we can do something to help them 

Given the funds The Hawk and Owl Trust can do just this 

But it is a charity that needs your help and I hope you 'll give it 

Please phone in credit card donations  on O eight one nine nine two  five five two two

The lines are open until eleven o'clock this morning 

The number again is  O eight one nine nine two  five five two two 

Or you can post your gift to me  Gerald Durrell  The Hawk and Owl Trust P O Box seven London  W three six X J 

That 's The Hawk and Owl Trust  P O Box seven London W three six X J 

The address is on today 's page of the Radio Times and on the page six three eight of Ceefax 

Please help The Hawk and Owl Trust to save this magic bird of sundown and twilight  and ensure that our children 's children will be able to see a barn owl silent as a cloud  drifting over the fields of our countryside

I 'm Edgar Wilson

I 've got one head two arms two legs a wife two children and a mortgage

Since I left school at sixteen I 've been gainfully employed in surprisingly respectable jobs in engineering and education 

I was born in Durham and I 'm glad to be a Geordie 

I 'm very proud of being British as well and I admit that tears come to my eyes when I watch something like the recent services commemorating the Battle of Britain 

But for me being patriotic has nothing to do with our monarchy

I think that the idea of hereditary privilege especially hereditary office is totally incompatible with the democratic ideals that British people have fought and died for 

I think that these democratic ideals still have to be achieved in Britain and I hope to show in this programme that this can't be achieved until Britain becomes a republic 

These ideas have been spreading and taken for granted everywhere else in the developed world for hundreds of years so it 's absolutely amazing that in Britain republicanism is something that 's hidden in the closet 

Although I publish quite a lot I discovered a couple of years ago that no mainstream publisher wanted to publish a negative analysis of the British monarchy that I 've written 

I have no doubt that some kind of taboo is at work

At the time there were about two hundred and forty books in print about the British monarchy  and only one of them was critical 

Opponents of republicanism in Britain have always tried to make out that republicanism is a philosophy of cold-hearted rationalism for humourless zealots and nutters of all sorts 

I don't recognise any of this

Far from being cold-hearted the great eighteenth century rationalist republican Thomas Paine who 's been called the greatest Englishman got himself sentenced to the guillotine because he argued passionately in the assembly of the French Revolutionary Council for the life of King Louis 

And speaking for myself I 've always been more impressed by comedians than by most politicians 

In my opinion the case for republicanism is unanswerable  but it 's not often heard 

But I feel the time is right now for people in Britain to consider it 

Although the monarchy is supposed to be part and parcel of British life people of all sorts can envisage Britain without a monarchy

Brian Micklethwaite is one of the new breed of Conservatives 

Although he has no ambitions for political office he devotes his time to exploring ideas that might be taken up as the policy of the Conservative party  

As I was passing through Newcastle station recently I asked some young women what their views were on the monarchy  

These young women obviously didn't feel that there was any taboo about the monarchy 

Like many people who criticise the monarchy they mentioned the wealth of the Royal Family 

Andrew Morton is a journalist and author who has studied the extent of their private wealth  

There are wealthy people in every country of course

What I find shocking and offensive is the way that the special hereditary position of the Royal Family has increased their wealth in recent years whereas their public responsibilities have been greatly reduced over the centuries 

The large private fortune of the Royal Family grows very quickly because their private income is exempted from tax 

Everybody knows that they receive income from the civil list for royal duties 

Most republicans wouldn't carp at this because all heads of state have to be paid for

But really the financial provisions for our Royal Family are far too generous especially when many people in this country are so badly off 

There 's often misunderstanding about royal finances however because there are crown lands that generate income which isn't paid to the Royal Family 

Royalists say that the country makes a profit out of the monarchy

Andrew Morton explains how this idea is mistaken   

Those people were interviewed outside Buckingham Palace

Like many others they believe that having a Royal Family is good for Britain 's tourist industry 

I couldn't find any real evidence that it is

Anyway other countries in Europe such as Austria and Switzerland make far more money out of tourism than we do and they are republics 

Of course republicanism isn't about the Royal Family failing as a tourist attraction but even so it is interesting to discover that it isn't a very great attraction 

The British Tourist Authority 's own figures show that the main tourist attractions have very little to do with living royalty

They 're places like Madame Tussaud 's Alton Towers and the Natural History Museum 

I took this up with the B T A 's chairman William Davis  

Despite William Davis 's predictable enthusiasm it seems to me that the Royal Family are at best marginal to tourism 

When you look at that other common idea that the monarchy is good for trade trade follows the flag and all that it turns out that this is a myth as well 

Personally I agree with H G Wells that it is a great mistake to regard the head of state as a sales promoter

Even so people do and when I checked the statistics for trade with countries visited by the Queen I discovered that there was no evidence that such visits significantly promote trade

In fact if anything the opposite is true

More likely than not either trade falls or a growth rate is reduced or the trade balance is made worse

Occasionally trade may improve after a visit but on the other hand it may not

Trade with China fell significantly after the royal state visit in nineteen eighty-six

I asked William Davis what effect he thinks the Royal Family have on trade  

I must say that until I 'd spoken to William Davis I 'd no idea that the monarchy was the only bright spot on our horizon 

Whatever doubts there may be about our trade and tourism there 's no doubt that the monarchy is good for the business of newspapers and magazines that trade on the popular interest shown in the Royal Family 

In the past the Royal Family didn't receive much media attention 

The most influential writer on the English constitution Walter Bagehot warned that daylight should not be let in on the magic of the monarchy if its prestige is to be preserved

The show-business style spotlight put on it these days is something new and not necessarily to the benefit of the monarchy 

I discussed royalty 's role in the newspapers with Roy Greenslade the editor of the Daily Mirror  

The apparent popularity of the Royal Family is the most obvious fact about it

I 've always found this puzzling in a democracy

Most people are quite content to at least take it for granted and some react very strongly against any suggestion that we might change or abolish it 

I asked Dr Anthony Clare whether as a psychiatrist he could explain the popularity of the monarchy 

It seems that many people are deeply attached to the monarchy despite the fact that some of the things they believe about it aren't true

Indeed it may be because they are ideals and not truths that they are so deeply attached to them 

This must influence people 's attitude to change and to the suggestion that we can only really be democratic if we don't have a monarchy 

I talked to Anthony Clare about the way British people feel about republicanism 

For me the need to alter the British constitution to change the role of the monarchy arises because it has real power and influence 

Many people know that the Queen may dissolve Parliament and appoint a Prime Minister

These powers could be decisive if there were ever a hung Parliament 

There are also considerable prerogative powers that may be exercised in a state of emergency 

And despite the pro-monarchist view that the Queen represents all the British people I think the only way that can be established is through the ballot box

And she doesn't represent me or people like me 

But most importantly perhaps the monarchy is also used to conserve and protect an elaborate system of established privilege and power 

Labour M P Tony Benn has studied the constitution throughout his political life and is currently drafting his own Government of Britain Bill in which he will be proposing to end the existing powers and influence of the monarchy 

He explained how these powers work in Britain  

As a republican from the traditional left I 'm astonished and delighted to see how much interest there is in constitutional change which involves the monarchy

Tony Benn detects support for constitutional reform of the monarchy across the widest political spectrum  

Most recently the deputy director for the Free Market Institute for Economic Affairs which has close links with the Conservative party published proposals which would strip the monarchy of its powers 

It seems to me significant that the I E A has since felt it necessary to retract these proposals and I couldn't find a Conservative politician who would confirm an enthusiasm for such measures

However Brian Micklethwaite speaks for the thrusting entrepreneurs in the Conservative party 

He 's executive director of the Libertarian Alliance which is a journal devoted to developing the same sort of free market policies as the Institute for Economic Affairs

He has wide contacts with young Conservatives and has himself helped to develop their ideas

He 's certain that republicanism is in the air for these people  

So far I 've taken it for granted that the monarchy is widely popular 

I 've always suspected that its popularity is exaggerated however

According to the results of the MORI poll published last January only eleven per cent of people say that the monarchy is important to their own lives

I think that this is really highly significant and could indicate a change in public attitudes to the monarchy that Anthony Clare also perceives 

I agree with Anthony Clare that we are in a transitional period

Entry into Europe is forcing us to question many aspects of our constitution

At a time like this it is important for stability to have traditions but I believe that the tradition we should look to is the one we can be most proud of the radical one of questioning traditions logically 

In this spirit I believe we should seriously question the tradition of the monarchy

In my opinion we would have more to be proud of if our country wasn't a kingdom

We are in the Simpson Hall  in the cadet school of the Peel Centre  in Hendon north London which is the Metropolitan Police training establishment 

Now I 'm sure I do not have to tell you who Peel was 

In any case you can see his statue outside the detective training building here  but in his day  policemen had only three weeks ' foot drill  and that was it

Today they are trained to act as public servants  and not merely as enforcers of the law

They are as somebody put it  the only twenty-four-hour social workers

But  they have their critics 

And therefore the motion before us tonight is the British public cannot have confidence in our present system of policing

It will be proposed by John Alderson who was Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall for nine years  and by Andrew Puddephatt who is General Secretary of the National Council for Civil Liberties  which we must now learn to call  Liberty

Now John Alderson when he was an Assistant Commissioner in the Met had a hand in the creation of this Peel Centre which the Queen opened  in nineteen seventy-four

He 's written extensively about the police in society

He 's at present Honorary Research Fellow at the Centre for Police Studies at the University of Exeter 

Oh and he stood for Parliament in nineteen eighty-three as a Liberal 

Andrew Puddephatt who is the son of a car worker has been a teacher a computer programmer and Labour leader of Hackney Council

But Liberty he says is not a left-wing pressure group

It is for all who fear that our civil liberties are at risk 

Now the motion will be opposed by David Owen President of the Association of Chief Police Officers and Chief Constable of North Wales  and by Alan Eastwood who 's chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales 

David Owen was born in north Wales where his father was a village police sergeant and he spent the first sixteen years of his life in the village police station 

He joined the Metropolitan Police forty years ago

He was in the C I D

Then he was Assistant Chief Constable of Lincolnshire Deputy Chief Constable of Merseyside Chief Constable of Dorset before taking up his present post in north Wales  back home nine years ago 

Alan Eastwood has been a police officer with the Met for twenty-seven years

As a constable and a sergeant he served in some of the poorest areas in the East End of London  but he is now spokesman for more than a hundred and twenty thousand police officers from constables to chief inspectors 

Now John Alderson and David Owen will open the debate  Andrew Puddephatt and Alan Eastwood will close it 

But our audience tonight consists of cadets recruits and serving officers in the Met who are here on training courses 

We 're also joined by policemen and women from forces throughout the country

and in the course of the debate we expect to hear from them and from the other members of the audience who include lawyers criminologists members of local authority police committees  and those who for one reason or another are concerned about the place of the police in our society 

Now  if the opinion polls are to be believed public confidence in the police forces has fallen

But is that a reflection on them  or on us

Do we ask too much or too little of our police

Do we have too few or too many

Should there be one national force or is it wiser to have regional forces 

And who should  police the police

The motion before us then is  the British public cannot have confidence in our present system of policing

And I now call on John Alderson  to propose the motion

Tonight we have Robin Williams and Robert De Niro in Awakenings 

Brian Brown prosecutes Japanese war criminals in Blood Oath 

And we talk to Michael Palin on location with American Friends 

Good evening

Awakenings is based on a true story

It 's about a group of latterday Rip Van Winkles who in a Bronx hospital in nineteen sixty-nine were briefly awakened from a catatonic state in which they 'd existed for thirty or even forty years 

Robin Williams is the diffident but dedicated doctor who brought about this apparent miracle

Robert De Niro is chief among the patients 

What had plunged all these people  into a state barely distinguishable from death was the side-effects of encephalitis from which they 'd all suffered in the nineteen twenties 

What brought them back to life was Williams ' experimental use of the drug L-Dopa normally used in the treatment of Parkinson 's Disease 

Goodness knows how accurate it all is

But the film adapted by Stephen Zillion from a book by Oliver Sacks and directed by Penny Marshall is fascinating gently amusing and at times very moving

And yet  well we 'll come back to and yet in a minute

The good points first

Williams is fine as a man so painfully shy as to be almost unable to function in normal society but still driven and pig-headed enough to continue his experiments despite the scepticism of his hospital chief John Hurd 

Well De Niro who is that original one has rightly won an Oscar nomination

And he 's as good as you 'd expect 

There are plenty of memorable and touching moments too

The wonder and exhilaration of the awakenings and then the awful realisation that miracles are not for ever that these people haven't been given life they 've only been lent it

It 's in the scenes when De Niro fighting against an on-rush of uncoordinated tics and twitches is beginning to relapse into the coma from which he 'd been so recently aroused that he and Williams are particularly impressive

And yet  there are so many questions unanswered

For a start the patients cannot at any stage have been braindead  otherwise they couldn't have adapted so well when awakened

You see what I mean

De Niro had been  asleep for thirty years and yet there he 's perfectly logical and cogent

So what one wonders is what went on in his mind

What went on in all their minds during those comatose years

The film doesn't tell us

Neither except most perfunctorily does it show their reaction to waking up in a world of T V junk foods miniskirts nuclear weapons rock and roll and all the other wondrous gifts of modern civilisation 

What it shows instead is a most unlikely romance between De Niro and Penelope Anne Miller as a visitor to the hospital

This Hollywoodisation of the story this smearing the dramatic pill with a coating of milk chocolate is regrettable but happily not fatal

Awakenings is still a good movie though not as good as it might have been perhaps and a worthwhile reminder of the strength and resilience of the human spirit 

Now though let 's take a look at the top ten films in London 

The music that accompanies the list is called Commuter and it 's by Murray Monroe

I tell you that because a lot of people have asked

Unfortunately it 's not available commercially 

But for those of you who 'd like to hear the whole piece I 'm not going to say a word and you can just listen

Enjoy that did you

Good 

So now let 's get on to Blood Oath another story based on facts

During the Second World War eleven hundred Australians were held in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp on Ambon Island in Indonesia

Only three hundred survived 

Blood Oath set in nineteen forty-six deals with the prosecution for war crimes  of ninety-one Japanese officers and men who ran the camp

A bad time to bring out a war film particularly in view of the fact that the video release of Memphis Belle has been delayed on the grounds that it 's inappropriate in the present climate 

Well no I don't think so

Indeed Blood Oath serves as a salutary reminder that it behoves us all to keep an eternally watchful eye on our leaders whoever they may be 

As the prosecuting counsel  Brian Brown is hampered first by a lack of eyewitnesses most of them being either dead or too ill to testify 

Just as importantly however Brown is also hampered by political skulduggery

The Americans don't want the trial to succeed

In particular they want the senior Japanese officer George Takai to be acquitted because the game plan is to appoint him along with other survivors of the Nipponese nobility to run post-war Japan as a puppet state under U S control

And boy did that idea go wrong 

Still Takai is released for lack of evidence

so the dogged Brown concentrating now on the murder of four Australian airmen  goes after the second in command Tetsu Watanabe a man who looks astonishingly like a menacing and oriental Oliver Hardy

Unexpected help for the prosecution comes from a young Japanese officer a Christian played by Noriyake Shioyi who had executed one of the airmen in the belief that the order to do so had been lawfully issued 

Blood Oath is pretty strong stuff and pulls no punches

You don't understand the Japanese says Watanabe

And indeed save at the very end the film makes little attempt to do so

A bit unwise of it perhaps in view of the fact that Japan now appears to own most of the world 

The Japanese are graphically depicted here much as they were in immediate post-war movies as brutal inscrutable sadists 

Brian Brown holds centre stage effectively as a man who starts out apparently conducting a personal vendetta  and then gradually learns compassion

And there 's good support from the Japanese actors 

Blood Oath is a competent piece of work a little rough around the edges and occasionally rather violent

But it also exhibits a healthy anger towards the political cynicism  which ultimately meant that while the law might have been served at the Ambon trials  it could hardly be said that justice had been done 

Oh by the way Jason Donovan makes his movie debut just for a minute or two  as an Australian squaddie

Now you see him

Now you don't

What he does is OK but there 's not much of it and certainly not enough to satisfy his groupies 

But now for our location report

Last summer Michael Palin was to be found at New College Oxford deeply involved in a film called American Friends

It 's a subject he holds especially dear because it 's based on the life of his own great-grandfather who was an Oxford don

The starting-point for American Friends was a diary by Edward Michael Palin 's great-grandfather a Senior Fellow living at an Oxford college in the eighteen sixties

Well American Friends opens later this month 

Now for those who 've been wondering what had happened to the British director Hugh Hudson  Chariots of Fire Greystoke and disastrously Revolution  I have the answer

The Road Home happened to him and I can only say I 'm sorry about that 

For this is a really doomy gloomy slice of life drama inspired by an apparently increasing tendency of middle-class American families  to shuffle their bothersome slightly delinquent teenage offspring into private psychiatric hospitals  and then go off to enjoy themselves feeling they have done their duty 

Adam Horovitz he of the Beasty Boys here making his film debut is the one so shuffled

He along with his truly delinquent half-brother Don Blumfield  hangs out with a bunch of similarly middle-class dorks and bubbleheads who call themselves Dead Birth and ape the behaviour of black and Hispanic gangs 

A spot of bother leaves Horovitz and the gangleader 's girlfriend Amy Bloggs briefly in the slammer after which Horovitz 's Mum Celia Weston and his stepfather Ron Frazier dump him in the Valley Acre Psychiatric Home 

Enter now a fraught but kindly shrink Donald Sutherland who tries to sort the kid out

But the kid is still rebellious and surly and under the influence of his gang  so you can see that Sutherland 's job is not going to be easy

The film is quite effective as a condemnation of irresponsible parents who seem to be even more screwed up than their children and of the hospitals which are run simply as a business 

The kids are kept there until the money runs out 

And when it does well goodness me would you believe it

the patients are deemed cured and ready to take their place in society

Only in America I suppose

Or only in America I hope 

The trouble is that The Road Home which started out in the U S A a couple of years ago under the much better title Lost Angels is for the most part such a grim glum tale that it 's very hard to care what happens 

So let 's have a look at the latest movie news

The final film of the evening Fear is a cheerfully dopey thriller about this psychic Ally Sheedy  who can see into the minds of serial killers and thus help the otherwise baffled cops to bring them to justice or blow them away whichever seems more convenient 

Anyway Sheedy 's been turning her uncanny exploits into bestselling books

But now tiring of that she fancies herself as a novelist 

Hang about say her publishers 

We 'll print the novel certainly

but first pretty please unmask just one more serial killer

Pots of money in books about serial killers 

And goodness me you 'll never credit this a serial killer pops up right that minute

Thing is you see that this one 's a psychic too and a better psychic than Sheedy 

He not only reads her mind but borrows it as well and takes it along with him on his anti-social escapades 

What 's more he 's a nasty serial killer even as serial killers go with a habit of using his victim 's blood to write Fear me on the wall 

Well Sheedy who somewhere along the line has picked up a fireman Michael O'Keeffe and installed him as a boyfriend  is in a bit of a pickle as you can imagine

Her agent Lauren Hutton is in an even thicker pickle because the killer has her marked down as a victim

At this point you rather expect the late Graham Chapman to pop up and say it 's getting silly now

But he doesn't and it gets sillier especially at the end when the killer inevitably turns his murderous intentions on Sheedy herself for the final showdown the battle of the psychics 

Most of the cast aren't called upon to do much

They 're simply there sort of hanging out

But Sheedy who normally appears as the girlfriend in movies like Wargames The Breakfast Club and Short Circuit  clearly relishes this unaccustomed leading role and hurls herself into it with engaging enthusiasm  as if she really believed all the nonsense

Next week we have Mike Lee 's latest slice of British domestic comedy Life is Sweet 

John Travolta and Kirsty Allie are back as we always knew they would be in Look Who 's Talking Two 

And Oliver Stone will be discussing his latest film The Doors which deals with the life and death of the rock musician Jim Morrison 

But to round things off for now here 's a clip from another sequel Highlander Two featuring as before Sean Connery

Goodbye

Sceptics turn their eyes to that deadliest form of international trade arms sales

History is on their side 

During that flurry of early twentieth century entente cordiale it was the dreadnoughts in the German and British shipyards which told a different story

With the ink scarcely dry on the United Nations Charter signed by the Great Powers in nineteen forty-five the United States and the Soviet Union began a menacing nuclear-tipped arms race 

Will the impact of the Gulf War be any different

Or will it very swiftly be business as usual for the world 's armourers eyeing that once lavish market in the Middle East a region which has only three per cent of the world 's population but fuelled forty per cent of the global arms trade in the nineteen eighties

Sir Anthony Parsons former British Ambassador to the United Nations was in charge of the British Embassy in Teheran when the Shah fell and began his diplomatic career as our military attach&eacute; in Baghdad nearly forty years ago 

But has that lesson been learned

The arms trade operates in an alibi society

The manufacturers in Britain France and America all say rightly that theirs is not a free market governments regulate them with controls and export licences

The buck and with it the moral responsibility is conveniently passed to the politician

In Britain it stops on the desk of Douglas Hurd the Foreign Secretary 

What will go into the making of that logical and realistic approach

Already the Prime Minister John Major has pressed for a U N register of arms transfers

The five permanent members of the Security Council between them account for nearly ninety per cent of all arms sales to the Middle East

President Bush has announced the United States 's intention of destroying its stockpile of chemical weapons provided the current talks in Geneva succeed in producing a treaty banning their use

There 's talk in Washington of a ban on sales of enriched uranium and the raw materials needed for chemical and biological warfare plus an agreement among the world 's most advanced weapon states not to sell any but the shortest range missiles to Middle East countries

James Baker the United States Secretary of State it appears has been pressing for more on the conventional arms side the kind of weapons that wars are actually fought with

Mr Baker argued for a prolongation of the de facto moratorium on new arms sales to the Middle East which the State Department has been operating since last autumn

Though substantial tranches of old orders signed before the Gulf War have continued to pass through the pipeline to Saudi Arabia especially 

The signs are that Mr Baker has lost the battle for the President 's ear to the more hawkish lobbying of the Pentagon and the National Security staff 

Congressman Lee Hamilton chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Sub-Committee on Europe and the Middle East is one of the group of influential Democrats pressing for a temporary freeze on arms exports 

The Bush administration 's policy of rewarding its allies with arms supplies does seem to find support across the Atlantic

Douglas Hurd the Foreign Secretary 

True

But how can they be enforced without much tougher controls

And how much of a breakthrough would a U N register of the kind the British government wants actually be 

Washington is already an open book in this sense

Under the so-called Javitz Rules Congress is initially told in confidence about any big arms transfer the government has in mind

The deal is then announced openly when the State Department has agreed it

And Congress has thirty days to approve or reject the sale

So how would America 's arms makers react to a new U N register in New York

Joel Johnson Vice President of the Aerospace Industries Association in Washington 

In Europe where confidentiality is the norm arms salesmen are not so sanguine about the prospect of a new transparency on weapons transfers

Jacques Jengean executive Vice President of the French tankmakers Giat 

Will the French government decide that the imperatives of a new world diplomacy require Giat to open its order books

Or is the arms industry 's cherished secrecy safe in President Mitterrand 's hands

I asked Gerard Renan Junior Defence Minister with a special arms control brief in the government of Michel Roquard 

So France one of the world 's biggest arms suppliers and by reputation the West 's most promiscuous weapons salesman will still allow her customers to buy secrecy along with their kit 

When I asked Monsieur Renan if the French government was prepared to accede to post-Gulf demands from the National Assembly in Paris that its deputies have a greater say in where and what France 's defence manufacturers export he stopped the interview reached for his copy of the Constitution of the Fifth Republic and told me firmly that such matters were the responsibility of the administration not the parliament 

Mr Hurd too has no intention of importing Washington style openness into Westminster

Hansard will not be listing British arms sales in the manner of the congressional record

All governments want to treat arms sales as their own prerogative for all the well-publicised exposures of seepage around the edges of official control policy

Even in Washington where the power of the legislature is real and understood administration officials look upon arms sales as powerful instruments of diplomacy

Barry Bleckman an arms control negotiator in the Carter administration now chairman of the Henry Stimson Centre in Washington which specialises in arms control analysis 

Few in Washington expect the current unofficial moratorium on new contracts to last beyond the autumn

So what 's happened to that post-Gulf opportunity around which so many statesmen wove a tapestry of such pietistic hopes

Kristov Kau a defence analyst with the Institute for International Relations IFRI in Paris 

That central need to ease mutually reinforcing threat perceptions as Mr Baker and his Soviet opposite number Alexander Besmyartnik have been discovering is proving almost as difficult post-Gulf as it has during every attempt to negotiate a regional peace settlement since nineteen forty-eight 

Will the big suppliers the United States the Soviet Union Britain and France let alone the Chinese or the North Koreans hold off on arms sales in the hope that a mother of all peace conferences might finally materialise 

No

Weapons diplomacy doesn't stand still for long in an area like the Middle East and even if it did there are at least two other booming markets for arms supplies

India with its regional superpower ambitions is one

There are also the so-called little dragon nations of south-east Asia keen to stock up with the latest high-tech military equipment 

There is another kind of pressure on weapon supplying governments too much closer to home 

From their domestic armourers desperate to compensate with new sales for the disappearance of that great Keynesian multiplier we used to call the Cold War

In the arms business the big merchants of the apocalypse are the governments who could grant or withhold export licences

The black market of gun runners is a problem of a different if worrying order

The arms companies themselves those fabled merchants of death are knocking ever more desperately on the doors of defence ministries and foreign offices

not least in Washington where given the size of America 's domestic market the Pentagon more than at any time since the Cold War restarted old World War Two production lines over forty years ago is in a position to determine which defence companies live or die 

Just how deeply has the current post-Gulf moratorium on new exports bitten already

Joel Johnson of the Aerospace Industries Association 

Was there ever an arms lobbyist in history who didn't warn about a dangerous gap looming in the production cycle 

American manufacturers do at least enjoy the largest home market in the world

They export only between ten and fifteen per cent of their output

But their British and French counterparts are obliged by their relatively tiny domestic markets to strive to double that figure if their costs are to be kept manageable

So export markets could be absolutely crucial to their survival

The Ministry of Defence is British industry 's largest single customer

Over six hundred thousand jobs depend on its nine billion pound procurement budget ninety per cent of which is spent inside the U K

Already analysts estimate that out of a hundred and fifty-five thousand defence-related jobs in the heavily defence dependent west country forty thousand could disappear during the nineteen nineties as a result of cuts in domestic procurement

Trevor Truman of the British Defence Manufacturers Association 

What would happen to Britain 's and Europe 's defence industrial base if by some miracle an effective arms control regime really did cut down the export market leaving manufacturers almost solely dependent on the needs of their own armed forces

Sir Peter Levine himself a former weapons manufacturer was Chief of Defence Procurement until Easter 

The bad news for British and French manufacturers regardless of any new arms control regimes is the likelihood that their export markets will shrink anyway and not just because the Russians the Czechs the North Koreans perhaps even the Brazilians all desperate for cash will be undercutting furiously

That fabled Middle Eastern arms bazaar is simply not that promising post-Gulf 

Geoffrey Kenyon senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington and a former special adviser to President Reagan on national security affairs 

This is cold comfort for the Pentagon 's pensioners worried about dwindling production lines in their factories

But can't that fantastic technical ingenuity which according to some was what finally quotes won the Cold War for the United States and its allies at last be applied to civilian production turning if not swords into ploughshares F Fifteens into kidney machines 

Joel Johnson 

The last time American defence manufacturers tried their hand at civilian conversion was when the Vietnam War came to a close

There were some ghoulish disasters

Grummon for example dab hands at fashioning aluminium into fighters tried to turn it into coffins instead succeeding only in burying reputation and profit 

The picture is not one of unrelieved gloom for the manufacturers however

A jet engine is a jet engine whether it 's in a civilian or a military air-frame

For those companies that want to stay in swords rather than ploughshares the Gulf was a vivid advertising campaign for their top of the range high-tech products

The lion 's share of future defence budgets however shrivelled will go to firms skilled in what the experts call force multiplication in avionics advanced electronics sophisticated command and control systems 

The Gulf War also made the defensive Patriot missile a household name

But there is a danger here for the would be controllers of arms transfer

Just how defensive is a quotes defensive system like the Patriot or the Arrow anti-ballistic missile which the Americans are developing jointly with the Israelis 

Jan Nolan Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington who served in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency during the Carter years 

Is the possible proliferation of Patriot therefore likely to lead to a mass of small countries poking around in its entrails in the hope of coming up with the know-how to make a menacing offensive missile of their own

Kristov Kau of IFRI 

It 's nearly a century since Hilaire Belloc wrote his famous couplet

whatever happens we have got the Maxim Gun and they have not

For Maxim nowadays read Patriot

But arms proliferation has become a far more complicated business than that

It 's bound up with the rapid flow of scientific and technical knowledge and will remain so even if the rest of the sophisticated arms manufacturing world goes along with the American idea of an information exchanging suppliers club

Jan Nolan of Brookings 

Buying time does have its advantages in an intensely volatile region where regimes come and go even if in the end time cannot halt the flow of advanced knowledge which could be turned to military uses 

But isn't the clock speeded up enormously when for wider diplomatic reasons the advanced world deliberately sells modern equipment to its friends and clients

A long-lived scar on the American psyche second only I suspect to the one marked Vietnam bore the name of Iran

Maybe it 's a spin-off from the post-Gulf technological high but the fall of the Shah seems to be losing its power to frighten in the United States

Joel Johnson for one doesn't quail at the prospect of today 's friend turning into tomorrow 's enemy 

There is a problem with a pax Americana resting on an ever finer technological edge between the United States and the rest of the world

Could the United States slide into a technical race against itself now there are no new generations of Soviet MIGs to mesmerise the Pentagon 's planners

Isn't the newly awarded contract for the advanced tactical fighter a seventy billion dollar plus example of this need to keep one generation ahead of those air defence systems in the Middle East the Americans themselves are supplying

In the last ten years Britain has become a wealthier and more open society

The Conservative government has stood for wider ownership for more enterprise and self-employment for better access to education training and good quality services

It does not matter who you are or where you come from

It is what you put in and what you achieve which counts

A white-collar job is not superior to another kind of job

it 's just different

And your job need not limit your horizons

You 're as likely to meet the window cleaner as the bank manager at the golf club as likely to dine in the 

You are in mine

You 're as likely to dine in the five star holiday hotel in the company of the plumber as the stockbroker as likely to see the satellite dish on the terraced house wall as on the executive detached

And it 's the enterprise society which can provide the tax revenue from success that enables us to look after those who cannot fend for themselves

Class money is not the only issue

Having some income and wealth certainly helps

At all levels of income in the last decade people have enjoyed rising wages and salaries and increasing wealth

Seven out of ten now own more than five thousand pounds of assets where only half owned the equivalent in the nineteen seventies

The proportion owning more than fifty thousand of assets has increased sharply in the nineteen eighties and will increase further in the nineties 

Two out of every three adults now live in their own home

They do not have to stay put waiting for a council transfer that never comes

They can choose their own decorations extensions and personal styles

They have a stake in the country

One in four of all adults now own shares directly

One in twelve of all employees own shares in the company where they work

This brings a sense of participation and collective endeavour especially where there 's been a full employee buyout or a generous bonus or profit sharing scheme

Many more people can look forward to a retirement in the knowledge that in addition to the basic state retirement pension they will benefit from their employer or personal pension scheme

All types of savings are growing

P E Ps Tessas building society deposits are increasing rapidly

Total private savings are as large as the institutional funds that the commentators usually concentrate on 

The sense of belonging through owning a stake in the property and commercial life of the nation is buttressed by the spread of enterprise

Nearly three and a half million people now work for themselves twice the level of nineteen seventy-nine

There are well over one million live companies on the register at Companies House

The totals have been growing rapidly week in week out for more than a decade

The marketplace itself encourages classlessness

People and businesses rise and fall on the millions of daily judgements of customers

The market has little time for snobbery

Anyone can make it and many do

A sense of class can be fostered by educational or other privilege

That 's why the Government has devoted so much energy to changing the shape and raising the sights of our educational system

New city technology colleges offer a challenging education to those who want to make that commitment to excellence

Grant-maintained schools are being given the freedom and the extra money saved from less county hall overhead to take on the best the fee-paying sector can offer

All schools in the state system are being given budgetary freedom and their boards of governors strengthened powers so that they can encourage the best and respond to local circumstances

Where only one in eight went into higher education in nineteen seventy-nine one in five now do and we 're on target for one in four quite soon

And I 'm glad to see so many people tonight benefitting from that process because of course we want a better educated population and that is exactly what these opportunities can create

Only in Britain within the European Community are all sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds offered two years of training if they 're not staying on at school

and that 's an important pledge

Well we 're not going to force them to take it of course

It is offered if they want it

It is a central aim of policy to raise the quality of all public services

for a sense of class could be fostered by allowing public services to degenerate and restricting access to the good services to a politically chosen few

So we believe in more investment better management more choice some deregulation where appropriate to improve and expand those public services

The large programme of council house sales of urban regeneration the renaissance of enterprise and activity in the centres of old industrial cities has done much to spread assets and hope more widely

What socialism destroyed enterprise has embarked on rebuilding

This government seeks an opportunity society

It is out to s foster a sense of belonging through encouraging home ownership share ownership and savings

It is out to raise standards in public sector health and education to bring them into line with the best the private sector can offer

It is out to ensure that those with varied abilities talents and enthusiasms can find something of value and interest to contribute

We also intend that those who need help and support will receive sympathetic treatment from our welfare services

Yes

we are creating a classless Britain and a first class Britain one which can compete and where everyone can make it wherever they come from whatever their backgrounds

The vote has long been granted to those who have no property

It is now time to encourage as many as possible who are enfranchised in the political life of the nation to be men and women of property as well

The typist may be the amateur ballroom dancing champion and the doctor may sell jumble at the church fete

They are united by their belief in the opportunity society and their wish to contribute to it

I beg to move the motion

When Bryan Gould was speaking I was rude enough to make a a noise of disapprobation

The lady in front of me turned round turned round and said no

I 'm just prepared to call her a lady

I She 's obviously a woman

You 're very You 're very astute tonight in three-or-four-words 

But in any case in any case she turned round and said it 's all right Dowie

she said uh we know which class you come from

you obviously come from the ruling class

In fact I was brought up in a council estate in Glasgow for the first twenty years of my life

Anyway if this is true if I can get to the ruling class from the Glaswegian council estates in less than one generation this motion deserves your support

Now allow me to begin what I was going to say proper by quoting a letter written to the Observer a few years ago

It says  I was interested in your questionnaire on t v and had intended to complete it until I noticed the usual horrid little box at the end asking me to quote my class









Oh good a sense of humour from a Socialist

It gets better

Anyway from now on I refuse to fill in any questionnaire which perpetuates this absurdity

The British obsession with class is quite remarkable

We persuade ourselves quite against all the available evidence that it perverts our social political and economic life

Foreigners believe this too

Here for example is Helmut Schmidt 's famous quote of nineteen seventy-five

He said as long as you maintain this damn class-ridden society of yours you will never get out of your mess

But Britain is more or less the same class structure as most advanced industrial societies a declining working class an expanding middle class although we display more social mobility than most others if the leading sociologists not usually Conservatives are to be believed

Now in spite of this the British class system is regarded as peculiar

And it certainly would be peculiar if all the myths about it were actually true but of course they 're not

For example in nineteen eighty-four according to a Gallup poll seventy per cent of the British population claimed to be working class claimed not only that they were working class but their parents were working class

According to sociologists the percentage was at least twenty per cent less

That Labour supporters and those on the left of Labour should believe this myth is obvious

It is their life support

Just as it used to be said no bishop no king today we can say no class war no Labour party

Hence among other things the ridiculous proletarianisation of the Labour Party leadership

You get Tony B well uh Viscount Stansgate becomes Anthony Wedgwood-Benn becomes Anthony Benn becomes Tony Benn

Today of course we have Mr Bryan Gould an immigrant from New Zealand and a former Oxford don supported by Paul Foot the son of a Labour lord the grandson of a Lib-Lab knight helping to convince us that Britain is not an open society

Conservative politicians of course try the same old tricks

Our latest Prime Minister as Bryan Gould says proclaims himself the harbinger of a classless society

He never went to university

Well I 've got news for him

This is a long tradition among British Prime Ministers

Disraeli was Prime Minister from eighteen sixty-six to eighteen sixty-eight from seventy-four to eighteen eighty

Lloyd-George a very poor orphan brought up by an uncle who was a shoemaker was Chancellor and then Prime Minister

Ramsay Macdonald the illegitimate son of a fishwife Prime Minister in twenty-three to twenty-four and from twenty-five to two twenty-nine to thirty-five

A great deal of class mobility more than in most places for a very long time

Here is a good Socialist Professor Macrae writing uh some ten years ago

He says we have never since Elizabethan times had serious legal barriers to moving up and down social ladders never a closed nobility of the European kind



That is still the case today

Here I have the greatest modern work on social change and class in modern Britain

Professor Halsey a good Socialist good Oxford don in fact uh the Reith lectures now updated

What does it tell us

I refer you to pages one two nine to one thirty

He says  did mo well you should learn to read and make use of it then  did mobility patterns

no no no what lo look at the pictures

sometime I 'll be reading this for you

did mobility patterns change with the end of the long boom at the beginning of a new period of political economy in which growth was halted unemployment rose deindustrialization accelerated and economic management become Thatcherism

John Goldthorp and Clive Payne

These are eminent academics and sociologists

They should be on your side but they 've actually read something unlike you

Uh these people have now concluded

he said their conclusion is unequivocal that the stability of relative rates of chances of inter-generational class mobility which are analyses of the seventy-two data suggest that went back to the nineteen twenties has not been disturbed to any appreciable degree in the first decade after the end of the post war era

Under Thatcherism as under the last few centuries of British life facts actually show that Britain has been the most socially mobile society in western Europe

That remains today the truth

the facts the sociological facts they all show that Britain is rapidly becoming a classless society

Thank you

Mrs Thatcher contended that there 's no such thing as society

I assert rather more modestly that there 's no such thing as a classless society

And therefore in debating whether Britain is or is becoming classless I think we 're essentially having to make a comparative judgement

And my judgement is that Britain is and remains a society which is more strongly marked by class than most other advanced countries

Indeed class is so pervasive an influence in our society so much a seemingly natural part of the social landscape that it 's very difficult for anyone brought up in this country I believe to detach themselves from it or to make an objective judgement about it

I was brought up in New Zealand

and I 've never forgotten how odd it seemed to me when I arrived in this country to find a society which is dominated by a ruling class

a class which is cohesive and self-defining a class which is made up of people who look different often because they 're actually taller and bigger and sound different because they speak in a different tone or accent who enjoy better health and longer life expectancy who live in different sorts of houses who send their children to different sorts of schools who are educated in different sorts of universities

a class who dominate all the best jobs who own most of the land control most of the wealth exercise most of the power and whose dominant position is underpinned by a dense and complex class structure which effectively insulates them against challenge

Whether we recognise it or not we are each of us I believe in this country intensely and instinctively aware of our relationship with others in that class structure

We 're each expert at giving and recognising those myriad signals of speech and dress and behaviour which denote our social position

We 're keenly aware of what steps can be taken to move up just a little in the social scale as witness the eagerness which so many parents show in trying to buy for their children not educational advantage but social exclusivity through the private school system

Class also makes us aware of the doors which are closed to us

Class limits our horizons

In my constituency with the lowest level of children going on into higher education in the whole country people can still be heard to say higher education is not for the likes of us 

But we 're told by John Redwood that all this is old hat

British society may once have been rigidly structured and static

but it 's now complex dynamic and fast changing

Well even if that were all true it 's a very different proposition from arguing that we 're rapidly becoming classless

Indeed I argue that it 's the very complexity and flexibility of the British class system which has enabled it to resist the pressures which a more rigid structure would have been unable to bear

But surely it 's said British society is changing fast

We 're told that as more and more people buy their own homes or buy shares they forsake their class identity and become part of a much more amorphous society 

But even if that were true even if the weakening of working-class identity that does not mean that we are becoming more classless

It means only that the composition and self-identification of a particular class has changed

An older class structure is being replaced by a newer one a new class structure which is in many ways even more divisive

The dominant class remains as dominant as ever

Indeed in recent years its advantages and power and wealth have grown comparatively greater

It has also profited from the expansion of what might be called the consuming class a class that shares and apes the values of the dominant class but doesn't challenge it for power and thereby provides it with an ever more effective insulating barrier against change

This uh restructuring of the old middle and working classes however has left behind it what might be termed a new class a sort of disenfranchised group

They haven't shared in the prosperity

They don't have well paid jobs

They haven't bought their houses

They don't own shares 

They are those who are discriminated against

They 're the social casualties

They 're powerless

They are those who are alienated from the political process 

But surely it 's said  we are becoming classless at least in the sense that social mobility is increased

John Major can become Prime Minister proof enough that class is no longer a barrier 

Well the very frequency with which John Major 's social and educational background have been commented upon is surely proof that we are still obsessed with class

John Major  John Major himself almost certainly misinterprets his own experience

He demonstrates not that we 're becoming a classless society but rather what Tawney rightly excoriated as the tadpole philosophy that doctrine which views society as a frog pond swarming with thousands of tadpoles the huge majority of which are killed off by predators

But having made it to the lily pad the few lucky survivors nevertheless croak there 's not much wrong with a system that allows a humble tadpole like me to become a frog 

It 's not the frog  It 's not the frog but the tadpoles which tell us the truth about our class system

For every well-publicised exception there are unsung thousands who are constrained and defeated by our class system many without even realising what is happening

It 's perhaps the greatest triumph of our triumphant class system that its victims are often persuaded that it really doesn't exist at all

I beg to oppose

Well

now you should know that John Redwood is a high-flyer in the Government and a personal favourite of Margaret Thatcher 's

and I say that because I want you to come with me and make the supreme intellectual effort that he is asking us all to make in when he is trying to say that uh Britain is rapidly becoming a classless society

His argument is like this 

There are no classes because some people move from one class to the other 

I 'll I 'll repeat that  I 'll repeat that because you 're just university students and you 're not haven't got the brain power of a man like Mr Redwood

There are no classes  because some people move from one class to another

The society in which we live is one in which two per cent of the society own about half the wealth

and it 's getting worse the gap between the rich and poor

All the surveys show that 

The society could be described as having on the one hand a palace in which a few people live in great comfort and ease and a hovel in which masses of people live in great discomfort and unease 

And because from time to time one or two people escape from the hovel into the palace by the time-honoured methods in which people have escaped from the hovel to the palace speculating on the Stock Exchange  stealing cattle  having an affair with the nobility

this is the way in which people have normally moved from one way to another

there is no palace and there is no hovel but we 're all in one happy society together

Now why are the rich rich

Why is there a rich class

To listen to John Redwood you would think that everybody who was rich in this country is rich because of the tremendous initiative and enterprise and dynamism  and thrust which they have shown in the world around them

But the truth of the matter is that most of the people the enormous majority of the people in this country who are rich are rich because their fathers or their grandfathers or their ancestors in a sudden spurt of initiative enterprise and dynamism died  and left behind huge wealth

Then we ask ourselves how did those people become rich those early people become rich how does it anybody ever become why are they rich

The answer is because they own the land because they own the houses because they own the means of production the means whereby everything that 's produced in industrial society is produced and because they own those things are able to produce for themselves a surplus in different ways which come from other people paying money like rent for instance or interest

All these are income which come to people not through any contribution from themselves not because they 've made any contribution but from the contribution which has been made by someone else and therefore represents an exploitation which divides the society and brings to those people who 've established that surplus and that enormous wealth at the top of society a solidarity with one another which gives them that class entity which is so obvious to anyone who ever looks at how they work











The thing is that 's The thing is that 's total nonsense that I will read out to him the figures given to the House of Commons by Mr Maude his colleague in November last relating to shares which he talks about with such pride

The personal sector percentage share that is the number of shares owned by actual people has gone down from thirty-five per cent when his government came into office to twenty-six per cent today

In other words the personal shareholding is going down

and when he talks about insurance companies yes insurance companies yes insur just listen to what I 'm saying

when he talks about insurance companies and pension funds what do they represent

The sense of complete inability which people who even who have who pay those pensions who pay the money into the pensions or who pay into an insurance society have in controlling the policies of those pension funds or insurance companies

These are utterly hierarchical institutions totally insensible to any accountability

And the fact that they 've become more powerful in the society while even your blessed shareholders have lost out in the last seven or eight years is just another indication of the way in which the class has established new forms of solidarity and new forms of hierarchy which they didn't have before

That 's all that represents

Yes it is

Now  let 's just come on now

John Redwood talks about all those companies out there

What he doesn't say is that over the last few years particularly but certainly development over the last hundred and fifty years fewer and fewer companies have controlled more and more greater and greater corporate power

There are five thousand manufacturing companies with a share value of more than a hundred pounds in this country

Twenty-one of those companies control a quarter of all the manufacturing output in this country

Tiny little bureaucracies totally irresponsible totally undemocratic

Now you 've got to show if you want to show it 's rapidly becoming a classless society you 've got to show that those bureaucracies those hierarchies have become weaker and it has not

Everything that has happened in the last ten years has indicated that this ruling class these hierarchies which control the means of production have become more powerful not less powerful

All the time that 's happening

Privatisation of these great utilities has loosened what little public control there was over gas over electricity over all the telephones over all the other things that have been privatised

It hasn't made it freer

It 's made it less free totally undemocratic

Privatisation anti-trade union laws

Private health has become better

National Health Service has become worse

Private education has become better

state school system has become worse

And during the last five years and I take the figures quite arbitrarily the gross national product has gone up by forty per cent in that period eighty-five to eighty-nine

Income from rent has gone up from six point seven to twelve point seven nearly a hundred per cent increase

income from interest has gone up by twelve point five billion twenty-three point nine billion

income from dividends has gone up by from six point one billion to nineteen billion nearly three hundred per cent increase

The plunder that has gone on in this period in which the trade unions have been weakened public enterprise has been weakened the plunder that is going on day by day has increased the power of the ruling class all the time

Everything about our society is dominated by class

It twists our skills perverts our democracy ruins our economy

We 've seen our great piles of bricks built up while the homeless grow

That 's the world we live in

It 's a rotten world perverted by class and it 's time to change it

The Metropolitan Police  were quick to introduce human awareness studies into the initial training of recruits  and nationwide police came to place emphasis on community policing 

Panda cars were out 

foot patrols were in 

After nineteen eighty-one  the public were alive to the gap which had developed between police and the society they policed  demanding more officers on the beat and consultation on operational matters  especially when the police had in contemplation a high-profile and possibly provocative operation 

Brixton 's Operation Swamp was not forgotten 

That was the street saturation operation  designed to tackle street crime in Brixton which the police undertook without consulting or warning local people 

Indeed wretched relations  between police and public were a root cause of the disorders

That is the lesson of Brixton

In fact  organised community police relations had collapsed in Brixton prior to the disorders 

Far too many police  disillusioned and distrustful of local people  pursued with a narrow intensity their law enforcement duties while viewing somewhat contemptuously  the tiresome routines of community policing 

In their view the home beat officer was a nanny

They were the warriors of the law 

But we are now assured that this attitude is past and gone

What matters now is not what the police do but how they do it

Indeed senior police officers and a wide range of ordinary citizens have in this inquiry gone to considerable trouble to explain this is now what matters  like Brian Hayes the Chief Constable of the Surrey Police

So consultation and cooperation with the public  as well as speed and a sympathetic understanding in response to calls for help from the victims of crime and a physical presence on the streets are what the public now seek of the police 

And as we 've heard the police have said emphatically that this is the service which they seek to give 

They declare that good relations with the public are more important to them than performance indicators of success in the battle against crime 

a view which I find comforting in the light of the uncertainty of any conclusion based on any crime statistics 

Helen Reeves of Victim Support underlined this

But is this the whole picture 

The ethnic minorities of the inner cities still feel excluded 

They recognise the efforts being made from the top to reform the police service and change attitudes  but do not yet give the police their total confidence 

They contrast the fine words of men at the top with what they see as harassing and racist conduct all too prevalent on the streets 

They still see the police a white male organisation harbouring a great deal of racial prejudice and tolerating or at least failing to prevent misconduct towards black and coloured people 

They speak of continuing racial harassment especially of young black men 

Put simply  the principles of policing as asserted at the top  have not yet made in their view a sufficient penetration at all levels 

The same situation is noted within the force by black officers like Sergeant Sultan Taylor

And dissatisfaction is not limited to the ethnic minorities 

Victims of crime  demand a speedy and more understanding response to their calls for help 

And many neighbourhood watch volunteers believe that not sufficient encouragement and cooperation is offered them in the task of preventing crime

Like Alan Jones who feels his willingness to help is resented

And the general public  who have had many spokesmen in this enquiry notably a forthright and impressive team from Scotswood in Newcastle  want the reassurance of a constant sympathetic efficient police presence on the streets

Contrast what we 've just heard  with Brixton nineteen eighty-one  when many honourable law-abiding people felt  that the less they saw of the police the happier they would be 

But is all the talk about change of attitudes  and specifically of switch of priorities to community policing  too complacent 

Is there a darker truth  beneath the attractive public relations chatter 

Are police changes of attitude any more than skin-deep 

Do not the police really remain  as to many they appeared in nineteen eighty-one to have become  a white male force encased in technology and moving almost all the time upon four wheels while they pursued their first priority  a policy of reactive policing by which is meant the investigation of crime and the pursuit arrest and interrogation of suspects  with a few breaks on foot to suppress some public disorder 

These questions need to be put  even though the police may with some justification think them unfair 

Historically they are unfair 

The policeman was seen from the beginning as the people 's friend the protector of the weak and vulnerable the enemy only of the bully and the villain 

Today the romantic vision of the village policeman and the fictitious character of Police Constable Dixon may seem to be legends bequeathed to us by a state of society which no longer exists 

But they represented in their time  values which are at the heart and soul of community policing 

The change of attitude  perceived as a fact by some  and as a necessity by all witnesses to this enquiry is in truth a reversion to old values 

What have the police done 

Has there been action on the ground  as well as the verbal pursuit of high-flown principle 

I think there has been actual progress 

An impressive example of action was described to me by the Chief Constable of Surrey 

It is a new way of policing a community 

As some of its officers told me it is clumsily but accurately described as total geographic policing

And I have also been told that the Metropolitan Police  are introducing what they call sector policing which is to all intents and purposes the same system 

This really is action  not words and it should work well 

However  Surrey is one place  the inner cities another

More is needed there where the police have to do their job in a community  which has to endure heavy unemployment homelessness and poverty and which includes amongst its most deprived  ethnic minority men and women at the bottom of the pile of wretched living and working conditions 

Yet even in the inner cities there has been a change for the better 

Progress has naturally been patchy  for confidence in the police is a fragile growth

Distrust in the police remains a disturbing presence

Hostility may no longer be overt or general but it continues to exist 

Let me just show what progress there has been since nineteen eighty-one  by dwelling for a few moments on what the police have done or have not done  upon recommendations for specific police action which I put forward in the Brixton Report ten years ago

Overall the police have done well  but there still remain one or two matters  where not enough has been achieved 

I look first at the recruitment of black officers 

There is still a long way to go before it can be said that the ethnic minorities are adequately represented in the membership of the police 

And women are still under-represented 

While some but as yet pretty few women are at last achieving promotion to senior rank  senior black officers are rare indeed 

I recommended an independent system for the investigation of complaints against the police

but I did appreciate  that such a system might well be beyond our resources not only of finance for it would be very expensive but of skilled manpower in the work of investigation

And let 's face it 

the police are experienced and skilled investigators 

Indeed that itself is a strong reason for allowing the police under independent supervision to investigate complaints against the police 

The Police and Criminal Evidence Act of Nineteen Eighty-Four  has established an independent body the Police Complaints Authority to monitor supervise and review police investigation into complaints of police indiscipline 

The authority could and in my opinion should be given greater powers 

But the statutory system has made a good beginning and the police are cooperating well  with the Authority

I also made some recommendations about the accountability of the police 

Accountability as all acknowledge is a necessary constitutional mechanism for rendering the police democratically answerable for what they do 

In Britain accountability does exist  but it is muddled and incomplete

In England and Wales police forces with the exception of the Metropolitan Police are accountable to local police authorities 

This is called the tripartite system 

But the division into three parts is unequal and not clearly defined 

Indeed on operational matters the Chief Constable gets nearer to absolute power than any body or person in our democracy save Parliament itself 

The Metropolitan Police are however not locally accountable 

They answer only to the Home Secretary and through him to Parliament 

While it may well be necessary  for reasons of national importance that this should be so  there is no reason why the Metropolitan Police should not like all other police forces in the country be locally accountable 

Finally I said a few words about handling of disorder 

The police have greatly improved their training and equipment  for handling public disorder

The true risk here is that they may go too far  especially in the development of weapons 

A vital principle in British policing is that of the unarmed policeman

There have to be exceptions

but they must be few  and the case for them made out to public satisfaction

Now  let me say again that is not a bad record by the police

Indeed I think it 's a very good one 

Now lastly I 'd like to look at today and at the future 

Community policing  which is rightly the priority of the moment is a method and a style of policing necessary in a civilised and democratic society 

But it does not define or describe the policing function

I sense a confusion  in public and police thinking as to the nature and the limits of the police function 

The police provide a limited  but crucially important social service 

I would identify three basic police functions in our modern society 

the enforcement of the criminal law  the maintenance of public order  and an invaluable  first aid and control function in the aftermath of accident ranging from catastrophe to a minor mishap 

Everybody wants to see a policeman then 

Law enforcement duty  requires a very real power over the citizen being entrusted to the policeman 

It is therefore only to be expected  that when a case of miscarriage of justice  is exposed by the Court of Appeal and is attributed by the court to police misconduct public confidence in the police is diminished 

Dramatic evidence that this is so has been provided by two very serious cases 

The Guildford Four 's appeal heard in nineteen eighty-nine upon a reference by the Home Secretary to the Court of Appeal  and a similar appeal by the Birmingham Six this year 

The first point to be made is that the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six cases arose and were dealt with in the years nineteen seventy-four to nineteen seventy-seven long before the enactment of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act Nineteen Eighty-Four 

That act  was a great reforming piece of legislation and by and large it has been successful 

It has strengthened the rights of the suspect 

The act has however imposed a heavy administrative burden upon all ranks of the police 

But the price has been worth paying 

One may reasonably expect that the act will reduce the number of miscarriages of justice arising from police misconduct 

But is this enough 

In nineteen seventy-four seventy-five the year which witnessed the Guildford and Birmingham pub bombings in a sustained I R A campaign of violence  public pressure on the police to catch and bring to justice the perpetrators of these outrages  was enormous

In such a situation there is always a possibility  that an interrogating officer may be tempted to take a short cut to proof  by putting in evidence a false confession when he was certain he had caught the real villain or villains 

And that temptation will be strengthened if perfectly understandable pressures should be exerted from the top  to secure results in a case o of great concern to public opinion

An effective judicial control  of the preparation of serious criminal cases for trial could greatly reduce  the opportunities of police wrongdoing at that stage  or at the very least expose such wrongdoing before trial

On the lips of doctors

It 's really shorthand for the view that wellbeing depends on more than the absence of disease 

It 's not the case

so doctors will tell you that they 've only just discovered this idea 

Concern for patients ' welfare they claim  has never been confined to curing people 's illnesses and ensuring their survival 

Until recently though  doctors have had few methods for measuring someone 's quality of life

Such methods are essential because different people rate quality of life in different ways  and no assessment is valid until a great deal is known about the needs and values of the person being assessed 

Before considering how quality of life can be measured  what impact can assessments of this kind actually have on medicine 

Dr Michael Hyland is a health psychologist at the Polytechnic South-west in Plymouth 

He 's made a special study of the lives of people with asthma 

The most obvious use of any form of quality of life assessment  would be in making routine decisions about treatment

It 's one thing to use these measures to compare the benefits of two treatments for the same illness  quite another to use them in deciding whether more overall good comes of doing say heart transplants or hip operations 

If quality of life is worth measuring  who should make the assessment the doctor or the patient 

Kingston G P Dr Michael De Souza has a simple answer to that

So Dr Hyland like Dr De Souza before him  thinks that the views of both parties should feature in the final reckoning 

The first systems for measuring quality of life were designed for use with any group of patients suffering from any form of disease 

But general assessments of this kind are relatively insensitive

Hence the development of more and more quality of life scales tailored to specific illnesses 

Dr Hyland himself has devised what he calls a Living with Asthma questionnaire 

How did he begin

Dr De Souza would also like to see quality of life assessments in routine use  but he 's backing a rather different way of getting there

As Dr De Souza is well aware  computerization of this kind won't be with us in three weeks ' time 

What we will be seeing very shortly on April the first to be precise  is the advent of all sorts of changes within the N H S including what 's known as an indicative drug budget 

Henceforth the annual cost of all the drugs prescribed within each general practice will be totted up and compared with a figure which the health authority has deemed reasonable 

What effect does Dr De Souza think this will have on drug prescribing  particularly in relation to the quality of patients ' lives

G P Dr Michael De Souza 

The consequences and effects of changes within the N H S are matters we 'll be hearing a lot more about in the coming weeks 

Finally this week another development in our understanding of the causes of heart disease  and the extent to which those causes lie within ourselves  specifically within our genes 

Professor Steve Humphries is the director of a British Heart Foundation research group based at the Sunley Centre in west London 

He and some of his colleagues have been trying to unravel one of the complex mechanisms which govern the formation of blood clots 

It 's important to know how clotting occurs  because one which forms in an already narrowed coronary artery  and blocks it can trigger a heart attack 

There are occasions following a cut for example when clotting is essential 

Most of the time though the tendency of the blood to clot must be resisted 

but not so firmly that it won't clot at all 

A balance has to be struck 

Acting on the side of restraint  in other words limiting the formation of clots and dissolving those already in existence  is an enzyme

So having too much of this inhibitory substance  P A I is a bad thing 

But why do some people 's bodies make more of it than is good for them

That 's a question P H D student Sally Dawson has been trying to answer

Sally Dawson  whose work is funded by the charity Research into Aging 

And that 's all from Medicine Now for another week 

Until next time

goodbye and take care



That was Mike Grierson a sociologist at Manchester University 

One of the driving forces behind the new interest in hearing voices is a Dutch social psychiatrist Professor Marius Bloggs of Limburg University 

Mike Grierson is one of those who have been influenced by his work

Besides being an academic sociologist  Mike Grierson is also the warden of a small block of flats for people diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia 

This gives him continuous access to people who hear voices  and ample opportunity to learn about their experiences  and to understand how they themselves interpret them 

He thinks two are now a further source of insights

Some interpretations of voices are unhelpful 

The belief for example that the voices are emanating from alien beings who seek to control the hearer  is not only at variance with objective reality but likely to be taken as evidence of madness  and treated accordingly

If the hearer can be persuaded that such beliefs are false  and then encouraged simply to accept the fact of the voices  to accept them as part of his or her nature and being  that person is less likely to become isolated and stigmatised 

Mike Grierson argues that the first step towards achieving this  is to understand what the hearers themselves make of the experience 

Kevin O'Sullivan too is interested in this aspect of hearing voices

The true explanation of auditory hallucinations is a matter of debate 

There are theories rooted in the neurophysiology and chemistry of the brain  theories based on the way it handles information  and psychodynamic theories which might offer interpretations like that put forward just now by Alan Leader 

But whatever the origin of the voices  and however mild they have to be coped with

As Kevin O'Sullivan has found out people devise all sorts of strategies for coping with their voices

What then does Kevin O'Sullivan think that voice hearers have to gain by attending a conference on the topic

Alan Leader  who manages to put his own experience to good use  as the coordinator of the Lambeth Forum for Mental Health the charity which is organising Friday 's conference 

A couple of months ago we reported how medical ethics is being taught at St Mary 's Hospital Medical School in London 

Shortly after that programme was broadcast  Anne Bird Senior Tutor in the School of Nursing at the same hospital  wrote to suggest that I ought to have called in at the building next door to see how she and her colleagues were approaching the matter 

Belatedly I 've done so and learned that trainee doctors aren't the only health care students being asked to think more about what they do  while they learn to do it 

The new nursing curriculum known rather grandly as Project Two Thousand  stipulates that ethics are to be taught to student nurses but leaves decisions on how much and in what way to individual schools 

Anne Bird and her fellow tutors have seized the opportunity with enthusiasm

Take three times a day with meals reads the label on the medicine bottle  or take twice daily or three pills every four hours 

But how many of us follow these instructions to the letter 

The technical term for this is patient compliance  an unfortunate choice of words perhaps with connotations of authority and compulsion 

But terminology aside it 's a problem real enough to have prompted doctors at Leeds General Infirmary  to organise a conference on it 

The reasons for which we neglect taking our medicines as advised include forgetfulness fear of side-effects and misunderstandings of the instructions provided 

Of course a failure to do so isn't always disastrous

Indeed in the case of say painkilling drugs to go on methodically taking them even if the pain ceases to be troublesome  would be foolish

In other cases though there may be only a limited margin for error before the treatment stops being effective 

You might think that finding out whether or not patients are swallowing their pills as prescribed  wouldn't be too demanding a task

In fact it 's extraordinarily difficult 

Dr Morgan Feely Senior Lecturer in Clinical Pharmacology at Leeds General has a particular interest in compliance 

First then what 's wrong with simply asking patients if they 've been taking their medicines

Joe 's aged five and bangs his head rhythmically against a wall

Anna seven years old clings to any adult she meets

Alan who 's eleven makes himself bleed 

Not normal behaviour is it 

When Joe 's father realised he couldn't cope with Joe 's behaviour he went to see Social Services

and they introduced him to Peter and Sheila who have a daughter of their own and sometimes two foster children 

For the last two years Joe 's father has visited him regularly at Peter and Sheila 's home

and on Friday nights Joe goes to his father 's for the weekend

Peter and Sheila are members of the National Foster Care Association and have been trained by them 

Thousands of babies children and young people who have had early experiences that have left them damaged need a foster family for perhaps a week a month sometimes even a few years maybe while their mother is having another baby or is too ill to care for the family and there is no other relative who can step in to help

So foster carers look after the children and keep them in touch with the other members of their family until the crisis is over and they can return home 

There are eighty-four thousand children in care in Britain today

Over half of them live with foster carers but more than twenty-seven thousand still live in children 's homes or lodgings

Many of these could be fostered too

The National Foster Care Association is the only organisation in Britain concentrating solely on foster care

It was set up in nineteen seventy-four and believes that fostering is the best way of caring for most children while they cannot live with their own families

N F C A receives some government funding as well as support from trusts and companies but this is not enough 

An important part of N F C A 's work is giving free advice to foster carers and children and young people in care

N F C A advise on the best way to recruit more foster families help carers children and young people who are having difficulties

They also answer many many general enquiries on fostering from the public

Foster carers involve the children 's families so that they don't lose touch

Two-year old Darren had to go into care when his mother Angela had a mental breakdown

His father is an epileptic and couldn't look after Darren so Darren went to a family who not only welcomed him but also his parents

The foster mother took Darren to visit Angela in hospital

And as she got better Angela was able to visit the foster home

In nineteen ninety eight thousand people used N F C A 's information and advice service

It is the only organisation offering impartial help advice information and support

And it must improve this valuable part of its work

Its current limited resources mean that some people don't get that support

A dedicated helpline must be set up

It 's this kind of immediate help that enables children and young people 's views to be heard and hard-pressed foster families to go on fostering 

Not everybody has the time to foster but everyone can help

Every penny counts and will mean a great deal

By giving a donation you will be helping those who foster and the children in their care

I was fostered when I was young and am very grateful and aware of the security and the love that it gave me

You can donate with a credit card now by ringing O eight one nine nine two double five double two

It 's always been difficult in economies run along Marxist principles to arrive at any firm conclusions about exactly how well or how badly they 're doing but one economic law is immutable

The more exchange rates you have for your currency the more likely you are to be living in a country teetering on the brink of disaster 

In the Soviet Union for example the rouble is non-convertible

a concept which means crudely that it 's worth whatever the government can get away with charging for it according to different circumstances

If for example you are attempting to do business with a Soviet firm you have the dubious privilege of paying for everything at what 's known as the official exchange rate three roubles to the pound

Until recently it was one for one 

That of course would make almost anything in the Soviet Union absurdly expensive so there is a second rate for tourists ten roubles to the pound

Quite illegally there 's a third market in money as well the black market which it 's said values the pound at somewhere between thirty-five and forty roubles

The whole system makes it extremely difficult to offer any assessment of what is going on in the Soviet economy

A winter coat costs about five hundred and fifty roubles cripplingly expensive for most Soviet citizens

It is after all two months ' wages for many workers

But for Soviet citizens with access to hard currency and therefore to the black market it is cheap

Now it is admitted what one observer has called an economic experiment which lasted for four generations after the Revolution is slowly and painfully being given up

It 's an experiment which produced some bizarre anomalies

There can't be many other countries for example where the retail price of a loaf of bread is lower than the wholesale cost of the ingredients from which it 's made

In his homely efforts to explain the need for change Mr Gorbachev refers over and over again to seeing groups of boys playing football with loaves because they 're so cheap to buy 

The price rises of course won't solve these problems overnight

Indeed they might never solve them

But they are the product of months of agonising debate which have in the end forced Mr Gorbachev a natural seeker of compromise to take sides in the interminable argument between liberals and hardliners about how to tackle the country 's chronic crisis 

Last summer when the government first put forward plans to raise consumer prices it changed its mind at the last moment and a team of radical economists close to Mr Gorbachev produced a Five Hundred Day Programme for Sweeping  Change

The title was designed to give the people of the country a psychological shock and to remind them of the scale and the urgency of the task which confronts them if they 're ever to develop a healthy economy

In the end its proposals many of them now adopted by Boris Yeltsin proved too radical for the Soviet government

The plan was shelved

The reasons why are easy to describe and very difficult to correct

If market reforms are to mean anything then market mechanisms must be used to set prices

In other words the cost of buying something in a shop must bear some relationship to the cost of making it in a factory

But at the moment the function of setting prices for everything from spaceships to saucepans is firmly in the hands of the army of bureaucrats who run the Communist system

They are immensely powerful and they know that they would have quite literally no role to play in a normal economy

The labyrinthine agreements they draw up which govern every area of economic life would be replaced by what they regard as the anarchy of the market

Mr Gorbachev 's steady retreat from the cutting edge of reform to an increasing reliance on the traditional institutions of Soviet power like that bureaucracy might almost with hindsight be dated back to his decision not to endorse the Five Hundred Day Programme

His problem it seems is insoluble

Preserve the old system and the steady decay which has gripped the Soviet Union for decades will continue and perhaps accelerate

Tamper with it or as the radicals demand scrap it and the vital interests of the apparatchiks of the party are threatened to the point where they hit back

There is of course also the risk that the anger which the price rises will inevitably provoke might somehow result in an explosion of industrial disputes or popular unrest

When the impact of the price rises sinks in the fear is that the increasing hardship will turn that smouldering discontent into a fire which could sweep across the country 

It was commonplace at the end of last year for western reporters to write about the long hard winter to come 

Now for much of the country that winter is over and most of the snow is gone from Moscow

But the prospect for many people is of a spring in which the problems only continue to multiply

In a few days ' time the Lopez family which owns the electricity monopoly here and has banking and industrial interests is to hold a family reunion

The several hundred people who 'll attend will decide in secret which candidate the family should sponsor in next year 's presidential election and what policy changes to seek through the members of parliament it controls and the cabinet ministers it can influence to advance its economic interests 

The Hashintos the Delgados and the dozen or so other great families which make up the oligarchy that controls much of the Philippines economy will make similar choices

And through a complex web of tacit understandings behind the political stage they 'll ensure that whichever candidate wins they will continue to hold the reality of power 

This is not an Asian system

You find it in Latin America in Colombia and Argentina a comprador capitalism introduced by the Spanish during three centuries of colonial rule

Manilla has the heat and violence the colour the vibrancy and the squalor of a Latin American not an Asian city the fourth highest murder rate in the world bracketed with Bogota and Sao Paulo

The rich live in whitewashed haciendas on private estates among palm trees and bougainvillea protected by barbed wire fences and warnings outsiders keep out

The destitute live on Smoky Mountain amid the filth of the city 's rubbish tips

Just the recipe you might think for a revolutionary upheaval

But wrong

The oligarchy is underpinned by a conservative Catholic Church led by the redoubtable Cardinal Sin a church which this Easter as every year allowed the faithful to nail themselves to the Cross in a gory reenactment of the Passion of Christ

Suffering in this life wins redemption in the next

The Communist insurgency is running out of steam

The threat of another coup attempt appears to have receded

President Aquino is unpopular but is expected to see out her term

Change in this country is slow and rarely what it seems

Even the overthrow of President Marcos was partly a settling of scores between the great families and the so-called crony-capitalists that Mr Marcos had raised 

Not that politics in the Philippines are just an empty charade

After the Marcos dictatorship democratic institutions have been put in place

The press is the raciest in Asia and among the freest

Mrs Aquino herself appeared in court recently to bring a libel suit against a columnist who wrote that she 'd hidden under her bed during one coup attempt

But the tentacles of the oligarchy are not easily prised free

If Manilla today is a city of potholes and leaking water mains peeling facades brownouts due to power cuts and uncollected rubbish it 's because the rich have blocked efforts to raise taxes which are barely half what they are in Singapore and Malaysia and no-one in or out of government seems too sure what the remedy is

The root of the problem perhaps is that machismo the Church and the Wild West have stifled whatever might have been the Philippines ' cultural identity

And without a strong sense of national identity it 's very hard to know where you 're heading

During one of the many television appearances he made during the Gulf War President Mitterrand was asked by a questioner about the future

The fact was observed the interviewer that there seemed to be perfect harmony between the French and American governments

He wanted to know whether one could expect once the war was over the return of what he described as French specificity

It was the thinking behind the question that was revealing

An assumption somehow that an identity of views between the United States and France was freakish and that if business as normal were to be resumed then there had to be a French position that differed from that of that of the Americans and quite possibly everybody else too 

Mr Mitterrand gave no very precise reply to the question and his interviewer must still be waiting for the specificity to manifest itself

Since the war ended the cascade of French initiatives in line with the much criticised solo last-minute attempt to avert the war which might have been expected has not materialised

More striking still Paris which had been arguing for years for its solution to the problems of the Middle East in the form of one or more international conferences has shown a readiness to let the United States pursue its ideas and while not abandoning its own schemes has put them to one side

Quietly and without undue fuss all sorts of cherished aspects of foreign policy seem to be under revision

In the eyes of some the ghost of Gaullist foreign policy is being at last exorcised

That policy has been the victim of gross caricature over the years not least by those who claim to be its heirs

Ignoring the fact that at moments of real crisis the late General was firmly on Washington 's side they have deformed it to a point where Gaullism almost became synonymous with anti-Americanism and a Gaullist position was defined by the fact that it was clearly separate from the American one whatever the merits of the case

This policy embraced the belief that France had a special and privileged role as an interlocutor with the Third World particularly the Arab states and a special relationship with Africa

It was distrustful of the Anglo-Americans

Fierce national independence required the ability to perform a variety of military tasks naturally without allies 

Whether or not the General himself would have recognised all these characteristics as Gaullist the Gulf War has in any case largely put paid to them

The present French Foreign Minister can now observe that the famous Arab policy was a myth a succession of illusions and with only the most modest of outcries

Gone are the days when any ruler in Francophone Africa could summon French troops to put down local unrest as more than one has recently discovered

Opinion polls find that the French are more pro-American at the moment than perhaps at any time since the last war

The immense difficulty that the French had in assembling a force for the Gulf has revealed the extent of their self-deception in defence matters

Paris eventually sent twelve thousand men who performed in an exemplary fashion under American command another break with the recent past but the quality of their equipment was often lamentable

Much thinking is going on as to why the British with a smaller army could manage to despatch three times as many troops with much more modern equipment

It is clear now if it wasn't before that France 's military ambitions to be a nuclear power and to maintain forces able to intervene rapidly in trouble spots and to be capable of fighting a major conventional war in Europe those ambitions hopelessly outrun its capabilities

Logic pushes in the direction of a European Army closer cooperation with neighbours such as Britain and the sharing of some tasks and not towards fantasies about the ability of a medium rank European power to ape American abilities

There are even signs that France is edging closer to the military wing of NATO which she left twenty-five years ago

On the European stage reassured perhaps by Germany 's confused reaction to the war and its continuing problems of unification France seems readier to play a constructive role

The French are never going to have a relationship with the United States in particular like that of the British

Nor are they going to ignore their history their culture and their interests throughout the world

but one consequence of the Gulf War may have been to open their eyes to who and what they really are

There was nothing in itself remarkable about the embrace of welcome which Jalal Talabani received from President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad

It was merely a Middle Eastern formality conducted before the massed ranks of the international press

But the result was an image which will linger long in the minds of all who saw it 

the man who 's done so much to bring misery and despair upon millions of his people planting a fleshy kiss on the cheek of a veteran opponent

It was at one and the same time both sinister and absurd

How could it happen

How could Mr Talabani and his colleagues conceivably deal with let alone trust President Saddam Hussein whose policies of deception torture and murder  have had their impact on almost every household in Iraqi Kurdistan 

The answer is simple

The Kurds had no real alternative

They were they are desperately aware that the very survival of an entity identifiable as Iraqi Kurdistan  is at stake in the present crisis

The Kurds make up a fifth of the Iraqi population  just under four million people but now the bulk of them have abandoned their homeland

The fear and panic which gripped people in the wake of last month 's failed uprising has yet to be dissipated 

On the border rumours of continuing Iraqi army atrocities abound and still the collective memory of Haladja and the terrible consequences of Saddam 's willingness to use chemical weapons override the general longing to return home 

But return home they must for there 's no life for them in exile neither in Turkey nor Iran

United Nations officials working in the mountains which straddle the Iran Iraq border estimate that two thousand refugees are still dying each day while waiting to be allowed into camps on the Iranian side of the border

Such figures are easy to use but difficult to understand 

Perhaps it 's more useful to say that still a month after the extent of the Kurdish exodus became clear to the world scores of babies and young children are fading away every night dying simply because supplies of basic drugs of tents and blankets have yet to reach the people who need them most 

True the international relief effort in Iran is now swinging into action after a desperately slow start

Even the Americans have expressed a belated willingness to fly supplies directly to Iran  but the Kurds know that humanitarian assistance alone will not ease their long-term plight

Those who stay in the hastily established camps in Turkey and Iran will join a long list of other displaced peoples  forced by tyranny or war to live in temporary and often squalid confinement

Today 's Kurdish refugees don't have to look to the Palestinians to appreciate the limitations of such a future

They merely have to talk to their brothers and sisters who fled from Saddam 's persecution of the Kurds in nineteen eighty-eight and who 've been stuck in closely guarded Iranian and Turkish camps ever since 

So it was the need to get their people back to avoid the creation of a permanent Kurdish diaspora that forced not just Jalal Talabani but the other main resistance leaders as well to contemplate a deal with Saddam Hussein

The Pashmurga guerillas have accepted that the removal of Saddam by force is beyond their capabilities 

And it 's clear to them now in a way in which it wasn't clear six weeks ago that the Western allies will not support their military campaign

And so to the agreement signed last Wednesday night

The details have yet to be released but the basis of the deal seems to be the nineteen seventy agreement between the Iraqi government and the Kurds which promised self-government for Iraqi Kurdistan and guaranteed wide-ranging economic and cultural freedom 

This time the Kurds are even talking about a much more powerful say in the affairs of central government and the army 

But is any of this credible

Given Saddam Hussein 's track record the answer has to be no

For the allies who fought the war for the liberation of Kuwait and for the United Nations itself  one simple question has to be faced

Could force ever be sanctioned as a means of protecting the Kurds and indeed the Shiites of Iraq from the excesses of President Saddam Hussein

At the moment there appears to be no coherent answer from any of the parties involved 

President Bush said time and again that American troops would never intervene in the internal affairs of Iraq

But there they are on the streets of Zakho alongside British French and Dutch troops telling the Iraqis to get out of town or face the consequences 

Indeed the Kurds appear to be pinning their faith on a long-term international commitment to their security

But in a sense they have no choice

How else could they return to their homes with Saddam still in Baghdad

One can only hope that their faith is well founded 

If not then the agreement between the Kurds and Saddam will have been nothing more than a hollow charade  a prelude to yet more suffering for the Kurds of Iraq

When President Gorbachev returned from Japan a week ago he appeared to be in big trouble

His Tokyo summit looked like a waste of time and money

He 'd abandoned his collapsing country for a whole week to fly a huge retinue of government ministers advisers and experts half way round the world and come back with nothing  no promises of Japanese aid for the Soviet economy  no breakthrough in bilateral relations 

For the Soviet public watching his journeying on television it was an insult

While he his wife and his dozens of officials enjoyed lavish guesthouses and expensive Tokyo hotels attended banquets and planted trees  back home ordinary people were trying to come to terms with price rises that had just turned their lives upside down 

And who was financing this Tokyo trip

How could it be necessary to spend all this foreign currency when President Gorbachev himself admitted the Soviet Union didn't have enough money to pay its foreign debt let alone Tokyo hotel bills 

No wonder when the Soviet leader returned to Moscow he was deluged with calls for his resignation

His critics were attacking him on all sides 

There were the miners on strike for nearly two months now in a protest that was partly in reaction to the new price rises but mostly a renewal of the miners ' strike that shook the Soviet Union the summer before last a public demonstration of no confidence in President Gorbachev and his government who said the miners were not taking their demands for better conditions and more control over their own affairs seriously 

There were other strikes breaking out

on the railways the Leningrad metro shiftworkers in factories in steel mills and most tellingly of all in the once docile republic of Byelorussia

Signs of people reaching the limit of their patience 

Now not only were the queues for basic food just as long

but when you finally reached the front of the line the prices were two three six times higher 

But the immediate problem for President Gorbachev wasn't just strikes 

His opponents on the right the hardliners that is were also marshalling their forces

First there was the Sojuz group in the Soviet Parliament clearly influential

They 'd warned the President on the eve of his Tokyo visit not to negotiate any territory away to the Japanese and indeed he had not

But they also wanted a tougher line on domestic policy

And before President Gorbachev had barely set foot back on Soviet soil the Sojuz group had passed a vote of no confidence in him a decision to gather a petition to call an emergency session of the Congress of People 's Deputies the only body that has the power to oust him as President 

To collect signatures for that petition will take time

And summoning a congress is only the first step to impeachment 

But it 's a threat that still looms over him 

But the other challenge to President Gorbachev from the hard right was more immediate this last week 's plenum of the Soviet Communist Party 

Their complaints echoed those of the Sojuz group

He was letting the country go to rack and ruin

He was refusing to take necessary tough action to restore order

Plus more specific communist complaints

He had ignored the views of his own political party

He was abandoning socialism

He head of the party that should be leading the proletariat was neglecting the interests of the working class 

Well  as we now know President Gorbachev survived that Party plenum

In effect he called his colleagues ' bluff

It was a Communist chief from Kemerovo in Siberia apparently who provoked him angrily blasting him for incompetence and weakness

At which Mr Gorbachev sprang up brushed aside his advisers ' protestations stalked to the microphone to announce that if the party didn't need him he didn't need the party 

And then of course they all appealed for him to stay 

And so he did 

Well that 's how his supporters and advisers related that 's how he described it to the Soviet Parliament the following afternoon

It makes a good dramatic tale with a clear moral to it

Where would the Communist Party be without Mikhail Gorbachev

Where would the Soviet Union be 

So Mr Gorbachev ended his week still Soviet President and still leader of the Communist Party 

But has he really strengthened his position 

By staying on as head of a divided and angry party he may have lost out in two ways 

His communist opponents are still there and they 'll continue to work against him behind his back 

And he 's passed up an opportunity to rid himself of an unpopular label

While he 's got the Communist Party round his neck he 's not going to win back the confidence of ordinary people 

There Boris Yeltsin is one step ahead of him 

But there 's been another development this past week that could be much more significant 

That was the long meeting stretching late into Tuesday night that took place in a government villa outside Moscow 

It wasn't a round table President Gorbachev said later

it was a square table

But seated at it alongside him and politicians from eight other republics there was also the Russian leader soon possibly to be Russian President  Boris Yeltsin

What 's more the meeting produced a joint declaration which looks like the start of a compromise between President Gorbachev and his most powerful critic 

Not that the declaration necessarily means anything will change in practice

So much in this frustrating country never gets beyond words on a page 

But what it could mean is that President Gorbachev is beginning to acknowledge his own weakness  and recognise that though he no longer has the nation 's confidence  there are other politicians who do

It was a walkover

The European Community 's attempts to take on the United States during last December 's world trade talks here ended in embarrassing failure 

E C civil servants were simply no match for highly experienced political operators from Washington

They won the day

And the Community was left in the dock of international opinion as the guilty party behind the breakdown of the vitally important GATT negotiations 

The one Community official who did try to compete with the Washington machine before the world 's media  the first and possibly last Commission press spokesman to engage in the politics of the twenty second soundbite  has since been removed from his job

Put your head above the parapet in the European Commission and you 're out of work 

It 's on such occasions that the wide disparity between the United States and Europe the would-be superpower becomes starkly apparent 

The other day the American Secretary of State Mr James Baker and his entourage breezed into Luxembourg for talks with the Community

He was the master of events 

At encounters like this the sheer power which the United States can exert is glaring

By comparison Jacques Delors cuts a diminutive figure 

Beneath this perhaps superficial reflection upon the comparative strength of the two  there lies a very real question about future relations between the U S and E C

Before the Gulf War Washington was proclaiming its clear desire to upgrade its ties with the Community 

Washington signalled to the British Government that although the special relationship was still alive  the United States believed it should find its expression increasingly via the Community 

That changed of course with Britain 's resounding support for America in the liberation of Kuwait

Britain fought while most of the others fiddled 

But the war is over now and the United States will be taking a new look at matters in the cold light of day

The indications are that Europe will once again become the priority because slowly and awkwardly  a treaty is taking shape which will most likely emerge by the end of this year as a new European union

It won't fulfil the dreams of the wilder European federalists 

On the other hand it will disappoint those who 'd hoped that further integration had disappeared in the folds of the Arabian sands 

Out of it all the European Community will acquire a greater deal of policy coordination much of it on the basis of qualified majority voting

More areas of policy making may come under its competence

And the groundwork will be laid  should the E C decide eventually to assume a defence role

In sum the Community will more and more become a bloc which major partners especially the United States will come to deal with as a single entity  even though Anglo-American ties will remain a strong pillar of this new relationship 

The fact that Mr Major chose to launch his safe haven plan at a European summit before informing the Americans  indeed sought E C support before he went in to bat in Washington and at the United Nations reveals that he too understands that Britain in the years ahead cannot live off the glory of Desert Storm 

Late last year a new transatlantic declaration was signed cementing ties and there are now firmly established and regular diplomatic contacts between the Community and Washington

Indeed at the most recent encounter  following immediately after the E C summit  Mr Delors and the Luxembourg Prime Minister currently holding the Community presidency were able to reinforce Mr Major 's safe haven appeal 

That said there is a question mark over how far the U S wants to see its relationship with Europe become one of true equals 

Certainly Mr Baker is keeping the Community well briefed on his Middle East peace efforts

Any help the Europeans can offer in bringing the Arabs to the negotiating table  he will welcome

But that 's a far cry from Washington allowing the E C to join in as co-sponsors of a peace conference as it has demanded 

In Washington there 's great caution too over the prospect of the Europeans through the Western European union or an E C defence capability  pre-cooking decisions affecting American interests within the transatlantic alliance

And just see what happens if the GATT dispute is not resolved

The administration pressured by Congress and numerous lobby groups will have no qualms about taking its revenge in a bitter trade war 

When it comes to real power politics Washington knows how to play hard-ball  whatever its proclamations about a new atlanticism

My lords and members of the House of Commons 

I look forward to visiting Australia in February  the European Parliament and the Council of Europe in Strasbourg  and Malta next May  France in June and Germany in October 

My government attach the highest importance to maintaining our security

My lords and members of the House of Commons I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your counsels

Mr Deputy Speaker I intended to carry forward my predecessor 's work 

My central economic aim is to bring inflation down and to keep it down 

Beyond that my objective is to encourage enterprise by creating a broadly based tax system that allows markets to do their job with the minimum of distortion and government interference 

While there is no scope this year for an overall reduction in taxes  my budget today will include measures to help business through the recession in the short term and to encourage them to invest for the longer term 

It will provide assistance for families

It will also further the process of tax reform and it will make some radical changes in the tax system 

However as usual I shall begin with a review of the economic situation and prospects

I shall then deal with monetary policy and public finances

Finally I will present my tax proposals 

The financial statement and budget report together with a number of press releases filling out the details of my proposals will be available from the Vote Office as soon as I have sat down 

I turn first to international developments

The past year has brought recession to a number of major industrial countries including the United States Canada and Australia 

Growth in Germany has been sustained by reunification  but elsewhere in Europe activity has slowed and industrial production has fallen in recent months in Spain Italy and France 

In five out of the seven leading industrial  nations industrial output is now lower than it was a year ago 

The basic cause is the same everywhere

Very rapid growth Very rapid growth in the industrialized world during the nineteen eighties led to the re-emergence of inflationary pressures 

A period of slower growth was needed to stop inflation taking hold again 

In the autumn the slowdown was magnified by the Gulf crisis

Business and consumer confidence was badly dented first by the uncertainties  and the sharp rise in oil prices that followed the invasion of Kuwait and then by the prospect of war

Travel and tourism were especially hard hit 

Mercifully  the war was brief and the outcome successful

Confidence is recovering

And that will strengthen the economic upturn when the time comes 

And the fall in oil prices has already improved the outlook for inflation 

So while nineteen ninety-one as a whole will show little growth in the seven major economies a half per cent increase in industrial production compared to five and three quarters per cent in nineteen eighty-eight the slowdown is unlikely to last long 

Inflation is already moderating in those countries which are in recession  and activity should start to recover later this year in North America helped by continued expansion in Germany and Japan 

In the U K the recession came after eight years of growth averaging three per cent a year 

This sustained growth bred confidence and that in turn led to a quite unprecedented rise in borrowing 

Personal borrowing increased by nearly forty per cent in nineteen eighty-eight alone to reach fifty-four billion pounds and a new record for the ratio of debt to income 

This produced a sharp drop in the personal savings ratio which coincided with a massive boom in investment by companies 

In itself the rise of investment nearly eighty per cent between nineteen eighty-one and eighty-nine was welcome but the economy could not go on expanding at that rate

Some firms and individuals became over-extended and we saw a deterioration in the current account and a wholly unwelcome rise in inflation

It is easy with the benefit of hindsight to s to say that policy should have been tighter and once the problem became clear policy was tightened

We ran a large budget surplus

Interest rates were raised  and they had to stay high until there were unmistakeable signs that excess demon pra excess demand pressure had been removed 

This took longer than we or outside commentators expected

And the delay meant that the adjustment when it came was all the sharper 

Since the middle of last year individuals and companies have been taking steps to reduce their borrowing consumer spending has fallen back and the savings ratio has risen sharply to ten point eight per cent 

Firms have found it hard going

Profits have weakened caught in the pincer of low turnover and rising costs and the burden of debt taken on in the late nineteen eighties has proved a heavy one 

So Mr Deputy Speaker it is not surprising that business investment has fallen from the heights of nineteen eighty-nine and early nineteen ninety

Stocks are now being reduced and companies are making strenuous efforts to cut costs

This has led to a sharp increase in unemployment in recent months though there are welcome signs that firms are continuing to invest in skills and training

I expect output in nineteen ninety-one as a whole to be about two per cent less than in nineteen ninety 

Much of that fall of course has already happened

It is largely behind us and I sh as I shall be explaining in a moment the resumption of growth should not be long delayed

The process of retrenchment has been painful as it always is but it has been necessary and is now producing results 

The current account deficit has improved sharply especially the balance on manufactures even though world trade has been weak

Imports have fallen while exports in some sectors  notably cars have continued to grow strongly

testimony to the fact that industry is immeasurably better placed today than it was ten years ago 

And no one can doubt that inflation is on the way down 

We have already seen a fall of two percentage points since the peak last October and there is widespread agreement that the fall in inflation will continue through nineteen ninety-one and into nineteen ninety-two 

Indeed the prospects are now better than they seemed at the time of the autumn statement

The February survey by the C B I showed the balance of firms expecting to increase prices was at its lowest level ever 

The forecast published today taking account of the effect of the budget measures is for inflation to fall to an average of four per cent in the last quarter of this year and below four per cent in the first half of ninety-two

Perhaps my title is a little too defensive ladies and gentlemen

Perhaps too coy

You might even say disingenuous

After all you don't really expect me to stand here and tell you that in fact Yiddish isn't a real language but that nonetheless I presume to teach it at U C L

However my reasons for posing the question are not altogether flippant

And oddly enough it 's not only outsiders who ask it 

I dare say most of us feel that the nature of the work we do is insufficiently understood or appreciated by the public at large or even by our colleagues

No doubt that 's one of the reasons why these lunchtime lectures were instituted

You may think I am biased

But it seems to me that the subject that I teach Yiddish must be pretty high up on the list of subjects about which misinformation abounds and where the true facts are widely ignored 

So what is Yiddish

Is it just another name for Hebrew

The more knowledgeable of you uh m more uh knowledgeable among you may well laugh

But not long ago The Linguist of all things the official journal of the British Institute of Linguists carried an article solemnly informing its readers that Yiddish is a Semitic language 

It is of course nothing of the sort 

Hebrew is a Semitic language as are Aramaic Arabic and several Ethiopic languages

Somebody should explain to the author of the offending article that religion is not relevant to the philological classification of languages 

Yiddish on the other hand is a Germanic language that came into existence around the year one thousand when Jews migrating into southern Germany from Italy ah South-Eastern and Central Europe began speaking a subtle blend of their Christian neighbours ' Old High German just as it was beginning to mutate itself into Middle High German 

This was uhm uh much modified of course by the sub and ad strata composed of the complex linguistic heritage that they brought with them

From the beginning uh the language has been enriched by a large input of Hebrew and Aramaic as well as the various other Jewish languages such as Judeo-Italian Judeo-Old Czech Judeo-Greek that they brought with them

In the course of time the Slav component assumed a greater and greater importance without of course Yiddish in any way ceasing to be a Germanic language in the same way that it would never occur to us to describe English as a romance language just because a high proportion of its vocabulary is of Latin or French origin

Originally in a relatively stair uh Originating in a relatively restricted area in the Danube valley Yiddish gradually spread to a huge area extending from Amsterdam to Odessa from Venice to Vilnius

As the everyday language of millions of Jews for just over a m millennium it is naturally the vehicle for a rich popular culture

In addition to this there developed a sophisticated secular literary tradition which has had its two high points in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in Germany and Italy then in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Eastern Europe 

By the eve of the Second World War there were approximately twelve million speakers of Yiddish in its traditional Eastern European heartland

That is to put things in perspective more than the combined numbers of speakers of Swedish and Danish at the same period uhm or approximately three times the number of speakers uh that Modern Hebrew has today

This means of course that in demographic terms uh Yiddish was  uh the third or possibly the fourth most widely spoken Germanic uh uh language uhm after English and German and with approximately at that period I reckon uhm much the same number of speakers as Dutch and in any case way ahead of any number of other Germanic languages whose future is scarcely in question today 

One of the many paradoxes of Yiddish cultural history is the way in which it has suffered on account of its virtues

It 's a commonplace in this country that the expressive powers of the English language have gained immensely from the diversity of the raw linguistic material that it has absorbed in the course of its history

All the varied vocabulary of Celtic Anglo-Saxon Scandinavian French Latin and more exotic origin offers us an enviable choice of registers and nuance

Exactly the same is true of Yiddish a sister Germanic language which has been able to profit immeasurably from the linguistic and cultural riches that it has inherited from the Jewish languages that preceded it and uh with which it forms part of a continuous tradition as well as from the uhm uh uhm uh lexical and uh uh phrasi uh phraseological uh enrichment ab absorbed from the Slav languages subsequently 

One crucial difference it seems to me and this is where the parallel between Yiddish and English breaks down is that whereas English speakers have been overwhelmingly monolingual since the disappearance of Anglo-Norman at least Yiddish speakers like Jews everywhere since the Babylonian e exile have been predominantly bilingual if not polylingual

Since educated uh usually male Jews had a good knowledge of Hebrew and Aramaic and the levels of literacy among European Jews were astonishingly high when compared with their gentile neighbours until recent times and since a high proportion of the working often female population had a fair knowledge of the co-territorial usually Slav language it followed that there existed a very high degree of etymological awareness among or ordinary Yiddish speakers that would be unthinkable in an English context

This meant among other things that speakers were ca capable of a special kind of code switching which involved deliberately choosing to avoid uhm words of Germanic origin which normally formed the greater part of the vocabulary

Thus  you would normally translate the uh uhm uh the sentence uh the gentleman understands every word you 're saying as der Wersteht yede wordt uhm

And of course anyone who knows German immediately understands

And that 's the problem

So instead if you were afraid of having your conversation overheard by a non-Jew you would say  where only the article and the verb are not Semitic

The reverse case also existed

That is circumstances in which words derived from the holy tongue or loshen kodesh were to be avoided as for example when purifying oneself from a Mikva that is the ritual bath

This high degree of component awareness as we could call it left ordinary Jews potentially vulnerable to the suggestion that they didn't speak a proper language but a barbaric agrammatical mixture of several

This reaction was triggered a m uh uh as much as for any reason as any other reason as the result of the German Aufklarung or enlightenment movement

What happened basically was that as enlightened Germans began reflecting towards the end of the eighteenth century that there was no good reason for denying uh equal civil rights to the Jews who lived among them

educated Jews such as Moses Mendelssohn the famous friend of Lessing started to put forward the idea that if Je Jews were to deserve to be treated equally that they should come to think of themselves as Deutsche Statsburger wear the same clothes as their neighbours and speak standard German on the streets and at home while cultivating Hebrew in the Synagogue

In other words Yiddish like distinctive clothing was regarded as a cause of anti-semitism and a barrier to full participation in western ci uh civilisation

The result of such thinking was that in the German speaking lands in the West where a form of Yiddish lacking the Slav component continued to be spo spoken well into the eighteenth century and in some cases beyond the language almost totally disappeared largely as a result of this advocacy of standard German for all secular purposes by the Haskalah or Yiddish enlightenment movement 

By the middle of the nineteenth century Yiddish had almost completely disappeared from Germany where the Aufklarung and the endeavour to demonstrate fitness for equal citizenship had given rise to a systematic adoption of the ideals of Bildung and of the German middle class way of life

Not only was Yiddish shunned but all traces of Jewish accent or gesture the despised  were studiously eschewed

German Jews even made efforts to dissociate themselves from the Ost Juden of Galicia Prussian Poland and the Russian Empire

The assimilated western Jew uhm uh felt threatened by the outlandish demeanour of his eastern coreligionists who were increasingly to be seen on the streets of German cities after the Russian pogroms of the eighteen eighties

Yiddish came to be associated with the ghetto the caftan and uh talmudic sophistry

Even with absence of hygiene and with moral depravity uhm uhm se seen as characteristics of a medieval barbarism from which the German of the Mosaic faith had himself so recently escaped and of which he preferred not to be too insistently reminded 

In the East however the Haskalah unwittingly gave Yiddish culture a critically significant stimulus

The ideas of the Enlightenment it was believed could be propagated among the Jewish masses of central Europe only by means of a didactic literature which had no choice but to employ Yiddish 

However what was originally intended as a propaedeutic uh uh tool be uh had before long developed into the vehicle of an increasingly autonomous literary culture

The moralistic writings of Maskilim like Yitsak Meyer Dick and Eliakum Zunser paved the way for the astonishing efflorescence of Mendele Mocher Seforim and Sholem Aleichem

Despite of all this rich and diverse Yiddish cultural activity the Maskilic contempt for Yiddish continued to spread a kind of inferiority complex among Yiddish speakers and authors who wrote in both Hebrew and Yiddish uhm and who often signed their uh Yiddish pieces with pseudonyms lest the fact that they had stooped to write in the colloquial language damaged their reputations as as serious Hebrew authors

It was It 's partly for this reason that many Yiddish uh authors of this period including Mendele Mocher Seforim and Sholem Aleichem are still known by their pseudonyms 

Even Sholem Aleichem incidentally as he tells us in his autobiographical  when faced by the quandary of choosing whether pu purs to pursue his literary career through the medium of Russian Hebrew or Yiddish had to face the prospect that many of his potential readers would ask themselves the same question which we are considering here today



Is Yiddish a real language

True everybody spoke it but was it really fit to become a means of sophisticated literary expression 

Sholem Aleichem opted of course as we all know in favour of Yiddish and was far from being alone in challenging the prevailing negative attitudes

Noson Birmboim otherwise known as Nathan Birnbaum for example uh had been one of the earliest Zionists

But he became disenchanted with the movement 's exclusive preoccupation with Palestine and broke with Herzl

He turned instead to the concept of Diaspora Nationalism or cultural autonomism

Having rejected assimilationism in the past he now repu repudiated the plans of the Zionists to create a new hypothetical Jewish nation in the future

The real nation he contended already existed in Eastern Europe possessed of an authentically Jewish culture passed down through the medium of the Yiddish language

The task of the deracinated western Jew was to participate in a kind of reverse assimilation and to reintegrate himself into his vital tradition

It was uh uhm Noson Birnboim who convened the famous Chernowitz conference in August nineteen O eight which brought together a cross-section of Jewish writers and intellectuals who all from their various perspectives were concerned with Yiddish

Though Mendele Mocher Seforim and Sholem Aleichem were unable to attend the novelist Sholem Ash the dramatist Yaakov Gordon the poet Moshe Leib Halpern the philologists Martis Mizus and Noach Chalutsky took part in the proceedings

Chalutsky fought unsuccessfully for a resolution declaring Yiddish the national Jewish language

a compromise amendment to the effect that it was a national language was carried

Bitter wrangling between the Hebraists and left wing Bundists marred the conference however and it was unsuccessful in its primary aim of establishing a permanent organisation to promote the language

But it did much to raise the status of Yiddish in the eyes of a wide public 

Although the way had been paved by the Chernowitz conference a specific institution devoted to the standardization of the language and to the pursuit of relevant educational and cultural aims did not come into existence until nineteen twenty five when the Yiddish Scientific uh Institute Yivo  Yidisher Visenshaftlikher Institut was founded in Berlin and located in Vilna Vilnius

Writers still passingly refer to Anglo-Portuguese trade as vigorous regular modest increasing decreasing  but on what scale 

Is vigorous trade in the Anglo-Portuguese context two five or ten ships a year 

I became interested in Portuguese trade years ago as I wrote on Spanish trade

Well it seemed to me that despite the very good political relations that there are between England and Portugal  trade was modest  and I 'll come to some numbers later on

While the Basque and Spanish trades seemed to flourish very much better in rather less welcoming political circumstances 

And it seemed to me that with approach the approach of nineteen ninety-two with its promised closer commercial links in Europe  now including Portugal that it seems a good time to review England 's medieval links with what is commonly called her oldest trading partner

What I intend to do today is to look at the scale and the patterns of the Anglo-Portuguese trade in the fifteenth century especially at the Portuguese activity in English ports and to try to set this briefly against the background of the other areas in which the Portuguese deal

So what I 'm doing today is essentially uh at once limited it 's just looking at the activity in English ports but also very broad because it 's trying to set it in uh the setting of the whole century and  to some extent in the whole of Atlantic trade

How well I succeed in this you will of course judge at the end 

Superficially it seems reasonable to expect a regular and well-integrated trade between the two countries

Access  political relations and commodities would all point in that direction 

Access by sea is straightforward given the recognised hazards of the time such as storm wreck and piracy 

And geographically uh Portugal northern Spain Gascony England and Ireland are clearly all close and the Atlantic seas between them are familiar 

The opening of the regular sea routes between the Mediterranean and the Channel at the end of the thirteenth century tied Portugal Spain and England ever more tightly into the trade network with Europe

The English control of Gascony and the regular carrying of pilgrims between England and Corunna for Santiago reinforced English familiarisation with the Bay of Biscay

The fifteenth century instructions for the circumnavigation of England  a map taken from which I 've placed on the overhead projector just to remind you where Portugal is  uh the instructions for the circumnavigation of England describe the most frequent routes of navigation

Uh there is no such map like that in the directions themselves

They 're simply written directions in which the compass uh directions between Ushant and Cape Ortegal or between uh  Cape Clear and Finisterre are given

But what I have simply done is to trace on to a map the directions that are given which give you some indication of the  familiar routes the regular routes which the seamen would expect to sail and which I think underlines the number of direct routes across the Bay of Biscay that uh that were possible 

uh directions are given from Ushant uh from the Scillies uh from the south coast of Ireland down to Cape Ortegal or Finisterre

And then the directions take ships on to San Lucar uh using the  Rock uh Mount Cintra down by uh Lisbon and Cape St Vincent as navigation points

These are the routes which are familiar to the English and Portuguese ships and others on the routes

We don't have full descriptions of the journeys left by any merchants that I know of uh although casual references and charter parties refer to direct crossings and to the routes they used 

There are one or two descriptions of  journeys which underline  both the fact that they used the direct routes and the difficulties of it notably weather and the uh unintended landfalls that you can make if you set off from Finisterre uh to the south-west of England

Scores of ships are going to be plying these routes each year

The Portugal The Portuguese ones come overwhelmingly from uh Lisbon and Oporto

Of all the named ships that I can find about eighty-six per cent come from those two ports uh if figures mean anything at all

Seventy per cent come from  and then there are odd ships from   uhm Faro Setubal but in very very small numbers

The English ships are predominantly those from Bristol London and the West Country with Dartmouth particularly prominent in those

But some ships come occasionally from as far afield as Hull 

Lisbon was the main English market and about eighty-five per cent of the Bristol shipping movements were to and from Lisbon

And at the end of the fifteenth century free access was allowed once more to the Algarve about ten per cent uh  ships to and forth from there 

Return journeys would take about three or four months which would include turnround times uh in port

And although the summer outward sailings tended to predominate from England and inward sailings sometimes bunched in December as fruits and sweet wines were brought in for the Christmas market and the winter festivities sailing did take place in just about all months 

Political relations were also very good as probably most people know

Uh they 've been good since the twelfth century really when the English crusaders helped the reconquest and they 'd been tightened most recently in the negotiations which led to the Treaty of Windsor in thirteen eighty-six and the marriage of Lancaster 's English daughter Philippa to the usurping John the First of Portugal

Philippa and her household kept very close contacts with England for thirty years until her death in fourteen fifteen

Her three eldest sons Duarte who had become king in fourteen thirty-three Pedro Duke of Coimbra and Enrice better known to us as The Navigator all became Knights of the Garter as did Duarte 's successor his son and his grandson kings of Portugal

Philippa 's daughter Isabelle married Philip the Good of Burgundy in fourteen twenty-nine and became involved from fort in thirt in fourteen fifty in Anglo-Burgundian diplomatic negotiations very often dealing with her half uncle Cardinal Beaufort

Of all Philippa 's children it was the infant Pedro de Co Coimbra who was later regent for his young nephew Alfonso the Fifth who was most familiar with England

He came at least three times

Uh in fourteen twenty-five as part of a European tour uh when he served as a very successful mediator in the quarrel between his cousin the Duke of Lan the Duke of Gloucester and his half-uncle Henry Beaufort Bishop of Winchester  riding according to Gregory 's chronicle no fewer than eight times between the two before he could get them to agree

In fourteen twenty-eight he was back for his installation as Knight of the Garter and in fourteen twenty-nine he attended the coronation of Henry the Sixth

At that time he might also by chance have met his sister Isabella who was blown into Plymouth on her way to her marriage in Burgundy and stayed for about a month visiting the English Court en route 

After Pedro 's death and disgrace in a rebellion against Alfonso the Fifth in fourteen forty-nine it was Isabella who tried to find careers and sanctuary for his two young sons uh in England 

These royal links were deepened with aristocratic ones

uh Philippa encouraged the marriage of John 's illegitimate daughter Beatrice to the the Earl of Anthorp

And John and his son Alvaro  made quite  spectacular I suppose careers uh in England with Alvaro  being created Count of Avranches by Henry the Sixth in fourteen forty-five

The impact of royal and aristocratic links on trade can be seen in the activity of John Church of London as factor to the king of Portugal and in the royal and aristocratic ships which are used in the trade between the two countries 

The Treaty of Windsor was confirmed throughout the century at every change of monarch but links of course grew more slender as generations passed

The old links between the houses of Lancaster and  did not stop the king of Portugal recognising the Yorkist Edward the Fourth as king of England in fourteen sixty-one

nor did it stop Henry the Sixth 's supporters from a major act of piracy against Portuguese shipping in fourteen seventy 

There had been suggestions of further Anglo-Portuguese marriages for Henry the Sixth Edward the Fourth and Richard the Third but none of these came off the starting blocks at all

By this time Castile was looking by far the most valuable ally again 

Even at the beginning of the century uh political links had had tensions

The unpaid debts of John the First 's ambassadors from the thirteen eighties were still rankling among some of the English creditors who had ships arrested in fourteen hundred and three fourteen hundred and four and fourteen hundred and ten still trying to get their money paid 

And of course individual attitudes were always very unpredictable

Piracy and robbery and fraud could occur between individuals at any time whatever treaties said

Uh  one Portuguese John de Port found himself imprisoned in Honiton threatened with death in fourteen thirty-four as he tried to get from Devon to London to sue against those who 'd robbed him in Devon

They were desperate to stop him getting there in the first place

And in the fourteen forties uh Henry May of Bristol had a ship which rescued the Portuguese ship from pirates

Uh when he 'd rescued the ship the English master of Henry May 's was heard to say that if he 'd known the pirates were English he wouldn't have bothered to save the Portuguese and since they hadn't paid him a penny for his trouble he was disposed to wash his hands of them anyway

And if redress for all crimes was slow then the crimes that were committed uh on both sides

and there are occasions when the King of Portugal uh removes protection from English merchants so that reprisal can be made against them for accrued up crimes which have not been amended 

Further of course no treaty can work in isolation and Anglo-Portuguese relations were constantly affected by Anglo-French and Anglo-Castilian relations

On the one hand Portuguese merchants would benefit when war was open and Castile as a French ally became an enemy alien because then they would become uh the main source for Iberian goods  and it probably helped to promote their surge in the fourteen twenties to the thir to the beginning of the fourteen thirties

On the other hand they suffered when the Anglo-Castilian treaty of fourteen sixty-six gave Spaniards an economic edge over them by allowing them customs  

There were also tensions in mid century when the Anglo-Burgundian conflict upset the Portuguese who were used to dealing in both areas

The recent marriage of Isabella to Burgundy in fourteen twenty-nine did encourage trade there and also encouraged the triangular trade to develop between Portugal England and the Low Countries

But conflict meant that it was dangerous to sail between the two and the Burgundian embargos on cloth meant that English cloth was less available uh in Flanders 

The surge of Portuguese activity in the fourteen thirties seems to be partly linked with what 's going on in Burgundy 

Nevertheless the two countries did remain familiar ground despite the tensions

and a Portuguese immigrant Edward Branton who made a very successful career under Edward the Fourth was not the only uh Portuguese to acquire denization papers in the fourteen seventies

There are a lot of callers at our front doors nowadays some of them more welcome than others but in April there 'll be one caller you shouldn't miss the man or woman from the census the great national counting of heads 

The census aims to make a tally of everyone in the country on a certain day Census Day and the next one is Sunday April the twenty-first 

Where we are in what numbers of what ages and sexes and much more besides is the foundation of a vast statistical picture of enormous importance to all our futures 

It 's the basis of the planning and management long-term as well as short of all the services and resources that we tend to take for granted in our daily lives

Someone somewhere has to plan for the future 

How many ambulances to provide  how many football pitches  how many telephones 

One of the key statistics must be just how many of us there are 

The long tradition of the census means that we can trace the exact change in population over two hundred years back to Britain 's first census in eighteen hundred and one 

The last census in nineteen eighty-one showed the smallest increase ever recorded between one census and the next a population growth of about half a per cent

That statistic alone will have a vital effect for generations to come 

All the individual census forms from which statistics are produced are kept here in strict confidence for one hundred years 

The latest census forms that any member of the public can ask to see were filled in when Queen Victoria was on the throne 

The fine detail of a bygone age 

What will the census of April the twenty-first tell our descendants about us when it 's first available for public scrutiny in the year two thousand and ninety-two 

The census is a nationwide operation designed to apply the same kind of information gathering to every part of the country simultaneously 

If each local area carried out the survey each would go about it in their own way and at different times

It 's the overall picture of each part of the country at one moment in time that makes these statistics so valuable 

We all know in our own lives what changes the last ten years have brought

but none of us knows the picture overall

and that 's what the census supplies 

Take owner-occupiers for example

In the country as a whole forty per cent in sixty-one fifty-six per cent twenty years later

What will the figure be in nineteen ninety-one 

The number of pensioners living alone has increased markedly since the end of the war

Important to know in planning services to meet their needs 

The message about cars is loud and clear 

Car use for getting to work up from thirty-five to fifty per cent in ten years 

Two-car households nearly doubled in the same period 

We know there are around fifty-six million of us

but where are we to be found and in what numbers 

The distribution of the population changes in response to all kinds of factors and the census charts these human tides 

An accurate count of people helps central and local government and a host of other bodies to work out where to allocate funds and what 's required in the future across the whole spectrum of our needs  where you place shopping malls supermarkets petrol stations schools health services libraries police services and much else besides 

To make sure everyone 's included in the census the country is divided into small areas containing about two hundred households

Each of these is the responsibility of one person

That 's the enumerator a key figure in this giant operation 

It 's on the diligence of the enumerator who delivers and collects the forms of each household that the accuracy of the census depends 

Enumerators come from all kinds of backgrounds and are carefully selected and trained for this part-time job 

They are given strict instructions about confidentiality 

What you can be sure of is that the confidentiality of the census is complete

The enumerators are even allocated to districts some distance from where they live 

Another early lesson for the one hundred and thirty thousand enumerators working countrywide is that we don't all live neatly in houses

But their challenge is to find us wherever we are on Census Night  regardless of our lifestyle 

For census purposes a household is a group of people either related or rooming together like these students living at the same address with communal housekeeping 

A boarder living in a private house who eats with the family forms part of the household 

If you rent a bed-sitting room and provide food for yourself but don't share a living room you count as a separate household 

If you live alone of course you are the one who completes the form 

About two weeks before census an explanatory leaflet is delivered to each household

Every enumerator will produce an authority card for your reassurance 

About a week before the twenty-first of April the enumerators will be round again calling in person to deliver the census form 

Names and addresses are important at this stage to ensure that everybody is included in the census but except for the postcode they will not be entered onto any computer record 

For people whose first language is not English there will be leaflets available in eleven languages to help them understand the form 

A Welsh version of the form itself will be available in Wales 

There is in fact a legal requirement to fill in the form

but since we all benefit so much from the information it provides it 's well worth our time to deal with every query to the best of our knowledge

After all we 're only called upon once every ten years 

The census form has been designed so that household questions appear on the front and back

Personal questions are inside 

Answering most of the questions just means putting a tick in a box 

The form has space for details of a group up to six people

More than that and you 'll need another form 

Among a group like these students one person can deal with the form for everyone

Or if you 're over sixteen you can have a separate form 

Perhaps there 's some information you don't want to share with others 

For the first time the nineteen ninety-one census will include a question about long-term illness to help plan services and facilities for long-term sick and elderly 

A question relating to ethnic groups has been introduced 

This will help identify where racial disadvantage exists so it can be tackled 

The enumerators will be back to collect completed forms as from Monday April the twenty-second at a time which is convenient to you 

In case you have any problems your enumerator has been trained to help 

The complete forms will be kept safe and will be used to produce statistics only about the population in general not any individuals

And it is actually against the law for the census offices to pass information about identified people or households on to anyone else government departments outside organisations or individuals 

The census is a tried and tested method of gathering information vital to the management of our country

It 's not only worthwhile

it 's essential for now and for future generations 

Make sure that you don't miss out on Sunday April the twenty-first 

Remember

if just two people weren't counted in each of the one hundred and thirty thousand areas covered by the census net that 's more than a quarter of a million people adrift a city the size of Nottingham wiped off the map 

The census

It counts because you count

Ladies and gentlemen it 's a great pleasure for me to be here this evening  and to be able to tell you something about the Ordnance Survey in this its two-hundredth year 

I am conscious that your society i is older than my department by some forty years

And I am also aware  that your society in the late eighteen hundreds was very active  in encouraging proper mapping of England and devised an award to achieve that through the mapping of English counties  at a scale of one inch to one mile and to a consistent quality 

What the Society did uh at that time undoubtedly had an effect on the Ordnance Survey thinking  in that the county was established as a unit of mapping  and one inch to one mile was established as a scale in general use 

Also in looking at Ordnance Survey records I am aware that I am not the first Director General to address this Society 

It was in eighteen ninety-one  that  after our first hundred years that uh Major General Sir Charles Wilson spoke here about the making of maps and their distribution 

You 're obviously a Society which takes an interest in mapping  but at one hundred year intervals you don't place 

I thank you for that 

Well ladies and gentlemen Ordnance Survey makes maps and has done so for two hundred years

It makes maps for other people to use in a very wide variety of activities 

For maps are about the land and the land is vitally important to all of us 

The land is mankind 's primary asset 

We are fed clothed and housed from it 

We use it to generate our wealth and for our recreation 

Maps are a record of the land and as such are a necessary aid to good decision-making about matters concerning the land its development and the orderly administration of our society 

I believe that good maps will help good decision-making which will protect and enhance our environment 

As you will gather I think maps are very important 

I also think that this importance is often overlooked in Britain today because Britain is well mapped  one of the best mapped countries in the world 

And so maps tend to be taken for granted by the vast majority of us 

Of course this is perhaps the greatest compliment that could be played paid to the Ordnance Survey namely that its works are good 

they meet the needs of the nation for maps

and therefore there 's no need to concern ourselves more with the matter 

This evening I would like to explain to you how this happy situation came about  how the Ordnance Survey was born  and how the mapping developed 

And I shall also say a little of its future 

This is our two hundredth anniversary 

One very serious aspect of mapping is its use in insuring the security of the state against both internal and external threats 

It is always a high priority for national mapping agencies 

And it was the security needs of the state  which brought Ordnance Survey into being  in seventeen ninety-one 

Ordnance Survey takes its name from the Board of Ordnance  which in the eighteenth century was an important element of the military being concerned with fortifications artillery engineering and all matters technical 

This is the coat of arms of the Board of Ordnance the three cannons surmounted by  the cannon balls 

In the troubled times of the latter half of the eighteenth century there was a need for consistent and homogeneous mapping of Britain 

Following from as some saw it an unsatisfactory act of settlement between England and Scotland  the Jacobite rebellion of seventeen forty-five left the Scottish Highlands in turmoil 

And war with France  its revolution and the rise of Napoleon threatened England from the south 

In these circumstances and to be able to defend the country against internal insurrection and external aggression  there was a military need for reliable maps of consistent quality covering the threatened areas 

The pioneer of Ordnance Survey was a young Scot named William Roy  who in seventeen forty-seven when aged twenty-one was working with the army in Scotland 

At this time the Board of Ordnance decided that a map of the Scottish Highlands was urgently needed to allow the country to be opened up to troops and civil administration 

The work was ex executed by soldiers of the Board of Ordnance 

and much of it by William Roy himself 

This is a contemporary sketch of a military survey party in the Highlands  the surveyor with his theodolite or circumferentor uh on its tripod with the party in front of him 

It 's a sketch of the Kinlochrannoch area 

William Roy held a commission in the Royal Engineers and was also a Fellow of the Royal Society 

In addition to practical surveying for mapping he was keenly interested in scientific matters 

Thus he undertook work to determine the shape of the earth  a matter of much discussion in his day 

And indeed there was doubt about the relative positions of the Royal Observatories of London and Paris 

and  to resolve this Roy measured a base line of at that time high accuracy on Hounslow Heath now the site of Heathrow Airport 

He carried out triangulation to link the two observatories 

For the work he used a theodolite with a three foot diameter circle 

This very fine instrument had been made by the leading instrument maker of the time a man called Jesse Ramsden and it had been commissioned at the expense of the King uh George the Third 

It was in its time the most accurate instrument available 

It uh its horizontal circle was divided into ten minutes of arc this  brass circle here  eh very fine subdivisions for that time 

It was read by microscopes  uhm 

And indeed it was used until eighteen fifty-three 

It was the first theodolite that was capable of detecting spherical excess when measurements were taken on the curved surface of the earth 

In fact the original theodolite uh this was the second of Ramsden 's theodolites and this is on view in the Science Museum at Kensington 

the original theodolite was unfortunately destroyed

I 'll mention that later on 

Tragically although Major General Roy with much support in high places laid the foundations for Ordnance Survey it was not to come into being until one year after his death in seventeen ninety 

With the London to Paris triangulation complete  and after much debate  it had been decided that the triangulation of Great Britain should be carried out as the basis for a topographic survey 

And so a further theodolite was purchased that was this one  for Ram from Ramsden on the order of the third Duke of Richmond 

He at that time was the Master General of the Board of Ordnance and had earlier supported William Roy 's proposals for national mapping 

This purchase is shown in the expenses ledger of the Board of Ordnance on the twenty-first of June seventeen ninety-one

And this is the record that is taken as the founding of the Ordnance Survey 

Portrait of the third Duke 

The Dukes of Richmond have their estates in fact in West Sussex Goodwood quite near to Southampton

And eh I am pleased to say that we have uh uh maintained a a connection with that family

And indeed this is a photograph taken last month of the tenth Duke of Richmond planting a tree at Ordnance Survey to commemorate his ancestor 's foresight in eh forming us two hundred years ago 

The young Ordnance Survey quickly extended the trigonometrical work which already linked London and Paris until an accurate triangulation covered Great Britain 

This provided the framework for the mapping which was to follow 

The first priority of course was for mapping of the South coast of England and its fortifications  for it was here that the army faced the threat of invasion from France

Hence in the late seventeen nineties the entire staff of the Ordnance Survey was deployed in producing military maps of the southern counties 

These maps were of a scale of one inch to one mile  a scale of the order still found appropriate for military mapping throughout the world today and indeed the scale at which this Society had  inaugurated the county mapping of Britain 

The great attention  paid to  terrain and lines of communication  marked out these early maps as particularly suited to military use

This is part of the map of Kent  uh the North Foreland Isle of Sheppey  Canterbury in here Dover down here 

But you can see the very heavy marking of the escarpments which would of course in those days have been  uh very great barriers to military movement 

As the threat from France receded the Ordnance Survey began to produce one inch maps to a more orderly production pattern

And these were then modified perfected and updated  to become the much-loved one inch maps later one in fifty thousand maps  which today have such a very broad user base in education recreation way-finding and indeed still in defence 

The energies of the department were largely absorbed by this mapping eh during the early eighteen hundreds 

One of the busiest periods for Ordnance Survey was during the time of Major General Colby 's leadership 

He was appointed in eighteen twenty  and was the head of the department for twenty-seven years longer than any other 

And he was one of the more energetic and inventive of our directors 

He had a very deep and fundamental effect on the Survey 

And the ideas developed by him and under his guidance have affected the Department to this day 

Soon after his appointment  Thomas Colby was required to concentrate the effort of the Ordnance Survey on cadastral mapping of Ireland 

This mapping was needed for the proper and fair assessment of a land tax  the existing assessments having been shown by new surveys to be grossly inequitable in many cases 

Bearing in mind its purpose  the map needed to be accurate and at a fairly large scale 

To ensure the accuracy Colby 's surveyors triangulated the country to emplace trigonometrical control

And he chose a scale of six inches to one mile  to show the necessary detail 

At the start of the triangulation Colby measured a base line of about eight miles on the shores of Loch Foyle and this is a  sketch of base measurement being carried out 

the tentage is to protect the instruments and not the observers 

In measuring this base Colby showed his scientific bent by designing a new instrument  his compensating bars 

These were two strips of metal  with different coefficients of expansion and indicator arms attached by pivots to the ends of both bars

The measuring points were marked on the pivoting arms so that the distance between the points remained constant over a range of temperatures 

In fact we do at S oops sorry  at Southampton we have a set of Colby 's uh compensating bars in the  the museum 

And the bars are  sheltered in the wooden trough

And again there are microscopes at th the mounted at the far end for reading the fine marks

The uh trestles uh are uh placed uh uh uh so as to keep a constant height across the open ground 

Very slow process indeed 

But uh Colby 's work uh on this base was of such accuracy  that when uh the Loch Foyle base was remeasured with modern equipment in nineteen sixty  old and new measurements agreed to within one inch over the eight mile length 

That 's uh  about one part in five hundred thousand 

A remarkable achievement for that time 

By the end of Colby 's time with Ordnance Survey the work in Ireland had been completed and the department had moved to Southampton 

From its formation in seventeen ninety-one the Ordnance Survey had its drawing offices in the Tower of London 

And uh that 's a contemporary sketch of the Tower 

Uh our drawing offices were  in this building here 

Uh but unfortunately  in eighteen forty-one uh a great fire so damaged the those offices that the department had to find another home 

This was to be in an existing military establishment at Southampton 

And these buildings were to be the home of Ordnance Survey for the next one hundred years

They are the barrack buildings at London Road Southampton 

The question raised by the Moore case  was this 

If a patient 's tissues are used as source material for the  commercial development of biotechnology products  what property rights can the patient assert over his cells and the profits generated from the sale of those products 

Well this was the more or less revolutionary question put to the California Supreme Court a year or so ago 

Previously some ten years before that the United States Supreme Court had held in a previous case that patent protection extended to genetically engineered bacteria 

and one commentator then uh responded by stating that the bio-technology revolution had moved from the classroom to the boardroom and from the New England Journal of Medicine to the Wall Street Journal 

And since that case in nineteen eighty biotechnology has attracted massive investments and become a highly commercial industry 

The universities in these days when profit is as important as prophecy have not been left out of the race to exploit this new market 

The biotechnology research on human cells consists broadly of three technologies

Tissue and cultre cul uh cell culture technology hypodermic technology and recombinant D N A technology 

The promise of these methods is the development of new drugs and treatments which may alter conventional medicine 

The commercial value of these developments cannot be readily calculated

But as an example an estimate of the products from John Mer John Moore 's cell-lines based on his leukaemia cell was three billion dollars by the year nineteen ninety 

bio-technology has altered the practices of the medical research community

It 's also had an incalculable impact on the relationship between doctors and researchers and patients   when physicians are also researchers whose work on the patient can lead to financial profit 

The latter may take priority or at least advance the risk of seeming to conflict with duties towards patients 

The doctor who engages in biotechnological research uses as raw material his patient 's tissue and may from this develop commercial and profitable biotechnological uh and and may from this develop commercial and profitable biotechnological t technological products 

This may it need hardly be said lead to compromise over the patient 's best medical treatments to promote personal and commercial interests

For example the doctor may go beyond what is strictly necessary for treatment to obtain or to gain easier access to material for experimentation and commercial exploitation 

This dilemma has found a partial answer in the development of the doctrine of informed consent to include disclosure by the doctor-researcher of any personal academic or commercial interest in the patient 's cells or the specific treatment recommended 

Thus in soliciting the patient 's consent to treatment or the removal of tissues the doctor has to disclose any potential or other economic gain that he or anyone else so far as he knows may obtain from the post-operative use of the patient 's tissues 

Without such disclosure any consent received would not be informed or valid

In addition the doctor would be in breach of his fiduciary duty 

These are not my concerns here

The Moore case raises the possibility of the recognition of a property right over cells and other tissue

Should the law recognise human tissue as the personal property of the individual from three-or-four-words

Should the law permit the individual to sell his tissue

These are questions of deep moral significance 

The Moore court failed to meet the challenge 

What I 'm going to do is look at some of its reasoning and see why and then look at some of the moral and ethical issues that are involved

It 's an issue which I would suggest will not go away

and other courts and other institutions are bound in America and indeed I suspect in this country to be confronted with claims like the claim made by John Moore 

Now it all started in nineteen seventy-six when Moore learned he had hairy-cell leukaemia

He approached the medical centre of the University of California at Los Angeles and under the supervision of Dr David Gold the doctor who had attended Moore at U C L A he was hospitalised and went through a series of tests which included the withdrawal of extensive amounts of blood and cells 

It 's the case that at the time all five defendants were aware of the great commercial and scientific value of Moore 's cells 

On Dr Gold 's recommendation of treatment Moore signed a written consent form authorising the removal of his spleen 

Before the spleen was removed Gold had already given instructions that the removed splenar cells were to be transferred to separate research units 

These research activities had no relation to Moore 's medical care

He was not told

His permission was not sought 

In the next seven years Moore returned several more times to U C L A medical centre because he was told that this was medically necessary 

In fact on each visit Gold withdrew additional samples of blood skin bone marrow and sperm 

It 's assumed that throughout Gold and the medical centre were engaged in extensive research on Moore 's cells planning their commercial exploitation

In short this commercial expectation exploitation including establishing an immortal uh cell-line from Moore 's uh T-lymphocytes applying and securing a patent on the cell-line and entering with other defendants into the development and manufacture of important therapeutic drugs uh was  that they were on about

Dr uhm Gol uh Gold and his research assistant were in fact named as the inventors of these drugs

Now Moore never challenged the decision to remove his spleen 

It may have saved his life 

But he did attempt to state thirteen causes of action including conversion lack of informed consent breach of fiduciary duty fraud deceit and unjust enrichment and there wouldn't be much else that would be left 

The Court of Appeal for the Second District of California held that a person does have a tangible right to his own tissues and that conversion occurs when these bodily constituents were taken for any purpose without his consent

That court reasoned that since a person has the ultimate right to control his own body commercialization of a patient 's tissues by his doctor without prior consent could give rise to an action for damages 

The defendants ' appeal was held by a full Supreme Court in California

It can only It only considered three of Moore 's causes of action

Conversion breach of fiduciary duty and lack of informed consent

As to the conversion claim which is the one that I 'm going to be centring on the majority held that the cell-line could not be a patient 's property so that the conversion uh cause of action had to fail 

The court agreed claims as to breach of fiduciary duty and lack of informed consent did disclose causes of action

The b b majority in fact purports to show that Moore could achieve what he wanted under the latter causes of action

But it is the decision as to property rights on which I will concentrate

The reasoning of the court is poor often incoherent and it fails to live up I would suggest to you to the new challenges of biotechnology 

There is a   which does I think meet the challenge to some extent but I will make little reference to that 

The essence of a property issue was put like this by the court

First of all it characterises conversion as a tort that protects against interference with possessory and ownership interests in personal property

And then it goes on to say that Moore theorises that he continued owning those cells following their removal from his body at least for the purpose of directing their use and had never consented to their use in potentially lucrative medical research and that he moreover owned a proprietary interest in each of the products that any of the defendants might ever create from his cells or the patented cell-line 

Now in the majority opinion Moore 's allegation was examined under the existing law and found to be wanting 

No reported Common Law decision could be found which recognised human cells as capable of being the subject of property and of being converted 

They missed in fact or passed over an old Australian authority but it wasn't strictly relevant and I won't detain you with it 

The court went on to state what it considered to be several problems with the idea of ownership of cells 

Moore relied inter alia on the opinion of the United States courts that every person has a proprietary interest in his own likeness and alleged that if the courts had found a sufficiently proprietary interest in one 's persona how could one not have a right in one 's own genetic material something far more profoundly the essence of one 's human uniqueness than one 's name or face 

The court 's unsatisfactory response is that   genes have the same molecular structure in every human being and the same important functions in every human being 's immune system 

Moreover said the court a particular genetic material which is responsible for the natural production of the leukogene and which the defendants used in the manufacturing process is I quote also the same in every person

It is no more unique to Moore than the number of vertebrae in the spine or the chemical formula of haemoglobin 

This cannot be sustained

It surely is irrelevant for the tort of conversion that what is to be converted is to be found everywhere 

Property is based on the relationship between a person and an object 

The object That the object is one of a class commonly or even universally found is alien to the theory of property rights

Of course if Moore 's cells were really like everyone else 's they would not have been exploited for profit 

The fact that the genes though similar in every human being 's cell were arranged in a way which has value for the researchers make them unique not in their essence but in their ability to be used with a plaintiff 

The anomalous nature of the court 's reasoning can be demonstrated by imagining that Morm 's Moore 's spleen had been given to them in a formalin jar 

It could not then be unlawfully removed by the doctors or indeed anyone else 

The court also relied on Californian legislation dealing with the disposal of unwanted or used human tissue to dismiss Moore 's claim of ownership

The practical effect of this legislation said the court was to limit drastically a patient 's control over excised cells 

What the legislation did was restricting how excised cells could be used and requiring their eventual destruction

And said the court the statute eliminates as a result of this so many of the rights ordinarily attached to property that one cannot simply assume that what is left amounts to property or ownership for the purposes of conversion law

But this reasoning will not do 

The statute referred to tackles matters of public hygiene and to do this it limits rights 

It circumvents what a person may do with what is his

But it is no less his because he cannot do with it what he wishes

Implicit in the court 's reasoning is the assumption that ownership is absolute or it 's not ownership 

That this is wrong hardly I think needs demonstration

If it were correct it would make much twentieth century social legislation for example rent acts confiscatory and it would deny our property 

Furthermore what the court ignored is that the effect of the statute and its limitation would only take effect after the cells had been lawfully transferred to the researchers and the use of them terminated

The statute is actually of no relevance at all to the Moore case uh  because uh uh i i i i it is of no relevance at all to the transaction before the material becomes waste 

In any case it doesn't indicate that a doctor who removes uh the patient 's cells has a greater right to dispose of them than the patient himself 

The court refused then to recognise Moore 's property in the patent the patented cell-line and the products derived from it because the patented cell-line is said the court factually and legally distinct from the cells taken from Moore 's body 

The court asserted that what is protected by law is the patenting of organisms that represent the product of human ingenuity but not naturally occurring organisms

I believe that we now face  some months possibly some years  of very great danger 

The historic parallel of what is happening in the former Soviet Union  and to a lesser extent in Central and Eastern Europe  might be with the French Revolution

it 's too early to say 

That one can see the development of anarchy  that one can see the possibility of terror that one can recognise the possibility of the imposition of a new order  a new order itself both harsh and commanding 

all these things might happen 

They haven't happened yet 

It may be that the parallel is with the period of the  fall of the Tzar  the short-lived stage of the Mensheviks  who referred to the kind of common history of democracy that they shared with the Western countries at that time before they were replaced by the Bolsheviks and before Russia the Soviet Union plunged first into the brief  lit period of the new economic policy  and then into the terrible relentless darkness of Stalinism 

What we can say and need to say  is that we face something we have never before faced  the prospect of chaos in a nuclear world 

And it 's that prospect of chaos in a nuclear world that ought to I believe concentrate our minds  to try to respond to the challenge in more bold and unorthodox and imaginative ways than we have so far yet done 

I 'll come back to that 

but let me say that for many of us I believe the cold war was a kind of rigor mortis  a period during which nobody had to think very hard politically  about relations between the superpowers  a period in which the apolyptic apocalyptic threat of nuclear weapons meant that both the superpowers accepted the so-called mad scenario  the mutually destructive position of deterrents  and both sides believed that neither would actually risk unleashing a nuclear war 

Hence both Americans and Russians and their allies could rest reasonably comfortably in bed  because we lived in a world that was locked  between the superpower deterrents 

Of course many people since the Second World War have died  in broiling quarrels and civil wars in Africa in Asia in Central America 

There have been hundreds and thousands of deaths 

but all of them brought about by conventional weapons some of them supplied by all of us in the Western countries 

Terrible as they have been  the death squads in South Africa and El Salvador  the massacre of the Kurds  the destruction more recently of people and of priceless buildings  in what was  the Croatian section of Yugoslavia  the rich insulated western world has only felt itself to be marginally affected 

There have been moments when our insulation has been broken through  the agony for many veterans who served in Vietnam which goes on to this day the concern of relief workers working in places as different as orphanages in Cambodia or Aids hospitals in Rumania 

such men and women have felt the pressure of what France Surname called the wretched of the earth

but most of us live in a strange charmed circle  relatively rich countries where above all our newspapers and we ourselves are preoccupied with President Bush 's lips and Mr Major 's tea leaves

It is if I may say so a somewhat inadequate response to the terrible challenges of our time 

We were for many many months  reluctant to recognise that the Soviet Union was disintegrating 

I went there in September  to be an adviser on the construction of the constitution of the Russian Federation and we paid a visit to the Kremlin to try and discover what was happening to the constitution of the Union

We met a charming young man who was trying to write on the back of as far as I could tell an envelope  one or two amendments to the Union constitution 

He clearly believed in it no much more than we did and he smiled at us winningly and said  the kitchen is very hot here  he meant the Kremlin 

the only problem is there are no dishes in it

There were no dishes in it though the West went on believing in the Union long after it had effectively died 

Let me then say that today we at long last confront the scale of the crisis 

Today in Long Island  perhaps an appropriate place given the connection with the Great Gatsby  the countries of the West are meeting to discuss  emergency aid to the former Soviet Union 

Today at the request of Mr Baker  they are discussing what Mr Baker has outlined to them when he said a social and political explosion is a very real possibility 

But we have lost a tremendous amount of time  time in which the Western powers simply failed to respond  time that went on through the whole of nineteen ninety and nineteen ninety-one and where we are still effectively I believe underestimating the scale of what is required for us 

Let me then ask the first of a few questions 

What happened since the singing days of the velvet revolution  when we watched the collapse of the communist empire  fatally weakened by the unwillingness of Mikhail Gorbachev to use force to maintain its power 

One of the first things that happened was the coming to power in Central and Eastern Europe  and today of course in the former Soviet Union  of new leaders  immensely gifted  immensely brave people  but by the nature of things  utterly inexperienced 

The people that Eastern Europe chose to lead it  were people who had been least damaged  by living a lie 

They were often musicians philosophers physicists  men and women who had chosen these professions specifically because they could still bear some witness to the truth 

Their great strength was that they had never been involved in the politics of the old regime 

Their great weakness is that they have never been involved in politics at all 

But one of the things  I think we have sadly learned is that politicians  for all their poor reputation  are in fact indispensable in democracies 

The second thing that happened  was that much of the bureaucracy was dubiously loyal at best and in almost every case passive detached uncommitted to the velvet revolution

I remember being  at a dinner addressed by the Foreign Secretary of one of the Eastern European democracies  and looking at a worn-out young woman who was sitting beside me so tired that she could hardly stand 

I said to her why don't you let one of your other colleagues go next time the minister goes abroad 

you 're obviously absolutely tired out 

And she said

I can't

and I said

oh

come now

let somebody else have a chance 

She said I can't because there 's nobody else in the Foreign Secretary 's office that he can trust 

The instance therefore of a passive and sullen bureaucracy is much more important than it would be in the United Kingdom or the United States

The reason that it 's so important is because the bureaucracy was the transmission belt of these command economies in the way that the market is the transition transmission belt for Western economies 

Therefore the bureaucracy in the period of transition  is of even greater importance than it would be in our own democracies

It is a bureaucracy which is virtually unreformed 

I was told  only a week ago by a Minister of the Interior  that up until May nineteen ninety in his Ministry there had been  Soviet policy analysts who among other things were armoured with guns and who gave instructions to his Ministry as to how they should behave

He said to us it 's strange to get used to having to make the decisions yourselves 

Two final examples of some of the things that have made the transition so difficult 

First the absence of a civil society 

The more time I spend in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Union  the more conscious I become of how important a civil society is

What does one mean by that

One means by that the fabric of voluntary organisation  open relationships  a willingness for people to move together to try to change and alter and sustain things

One means in effect  the social contract about which John Locke wrote at the end of the seventeenth century  and which has been perhaps been one of the greatest inheritances of the Anglo-Saxon world 

In the absence of a civil society and at least to a very considerable extent it doesn't really exist in the post-Communist societies  what one gets is a pervasive distrust  what Vaclav Havel described as a moral vacuum 

And in a situation where there 's a moral vacuum  the absence of any certain borders  the absence of any settled nationality tends to mean that rootless populations and beleaguered minorities  feel themselves and indeed are  considerably at risk 

In the case of the transition looking for a moment at the economic sphere let me again mention a few factors that I believe have been important 

Excessive expectations  in effect the result of television  led many people in Central and Eastern Europe to believe that democracy  equalled the market  equalled immediate prosperity 

One of the great sources of disillusion in Central and Eastern Europe has been the extreme slowness of economic prosperity to break through 

This has been made  the more so by the lack of entrepreneurial experience in almost all the countries of which I 'm speaking  which is perhaps best summed up by a story that I will mention in a moment that I get from the Ukraine  but which shows the extent to which  the ability to  do deals  to fix influence  to reach those who you can  manage to get favours from  is much more important in these societies than the ability to manage  the ability to market  the ability to invent 

And it 's only gradually that people with the qualities required for success in a command economy can develop the qualities that are required to succeed in a free market economy 

But one of the problems  that is summed up in the story I will tell you from Ukraine  is the problem of believing that the state will provide all that has to be provided 

The story goes like this

An Englishman a Frenchman and a Russian were discussing what was their heart 's desire

The Frenchman said

my heart 's desire is to be married to a woman so beautiful that everybody else in the room is jealous of me 

The Englishman said

my heart 's desire is to have a great estate  with beautiful thoroughbred horses galloping around it 

And the Russian said

my heart 's desire is that my neighbour Ivan 's donkey shall die tomorrow morning  

Uncertainty about ownership is of course another factor that has made the economic transition difficult 

Even now in Hungary where I just left this morning  one sees the argument going on between the political parties

On the one side Fidesz a remarkable party which has an age limit of thirty-five for its members of Parliament  saying that it 's inappropriate to compensate people who owned land and owned property  forty-five years ago  that history must look after its own  a line must be drawn  and transitions must be allowed to go ahead without consideration for these historic concerns

On the other side the Smallholders ' Party  so utterly determined to make sure that every last penny of rehabilitation is paid to the old owners  that it 's now announcing it will leave the Hungarian government coalition unless its desires are met in full 

And one final example  one that perhaps comes closer to the heart to the heart of our Chairman 

and that is  that in a sense what is now clear I believe about the inner weakness of the command economy structure is that it was unable to make the transition  to information-based technologies 

I had the pleasure yesterday of talking at length  to one of the leading experts of the C M E A the Comicon economic group 

And he said

one of the things that the West has not appreciated  is that the Soviet Union absolutely refused to allow the diffusion of any technological advances from its defence industries to its civilian industries and from either to the other members of the pact  in other words  to Central Europe 

And consequently therefore in a way  the Soviet Union killed its own economic union  because it was unable to move and to adapt to the new technological revolution that was overtaking the advanced economies 

The whole concept of the degree of discretion of judgement of innate willingness to initiate and manage  that flows from a society of personal computers and networks between them  was one that was fundamentally deeply alien to the hierarchical structure of a command society

I was reflecting as I left the Department  eight years ago  on changes in the British ports industry 

This industry  had long been in the public eye  as marked by immobilised rusting cranes  dilapidated buildings a poor history in health and safety  and endemic bad industrial relations 

But the technology of the container was there as well 

In the private sectors Felixstowe  in the public sectors National Docks Board  and in the Trust Ports half way between 

It wasn't one form of organisation which was showing the way 

The National Ports Council  led in turn by Philip Chappel and Sir John Page  together with my excellent colleagues of the Department  the late and much beloved John Sanderson  and in Scotland  Ronald Gibbs  made a crucial largely unnoticed contribution by finding talent for the industry 's boards and top jobs 

Technology and people were at work 

Well I said  in nineteen eighty-two  that within ten years the ports ' industry would 've become a showpiece of British commerce  looking like a tidy site in the hands of an excellent clerk of works  colourful clean efficient safe and competitive 

Well I was wrong about it being a showplace 

its achievement has passed largely unnoticed 

If we 're going to uh look at the future with reasonable assurance we must at least  pick processes which can be seen to be at work already  which exercise wide influence  and which would require something cataclysmic to stem or reverse them 

Uh

this will bring us to some questions about what can reasonably be expected from organised government  operating within a framework of nations  in which nationhood  is regarded as incomplete  unless it entails sovereignty 

Perhaps something has to be given up now  to public opinion formed on a wider base than a nation 

Then we can go back to look at what would be seen on Judgement Day as what we could 've done 

What should the inhabitants of the British Isles try to do  in an age in which the world will be involved in inter-relationships suffusing the whole of its surface  with the people of the world as spectator of events  at the moment when they occur 





Uh transoceanic commerce is one of these inter-relationships

The common heritage of science is another  so is the aspiration to add to it so is the distribution or the maldistribution of food and medicine  so is the world 's endowment of trees  and of fuel  so are all the arts and technologies of communication 

Language is a technology of communication

But languages may be a barrier to communication as well as a medium of it 

In the past differences between languages  often given another dimension by differences between scripts as well  have impeded understanding between societies and for long periods limited discovery 

One example has been at China 's frontiers 

Another from which we suffer still  has been of the divide between Christendom and Islam 

Sometimes language has become inadvertently or otherwise an instrument of exclusion 

When Latin uh what what Latin was to the medieval cleric 's virtual monopoly of literacy  technical language may be to the modern possessor of special knowledge  or jargon to the pretence of it 

In past ages individual study apart  languages have been tied closely to geography largely because most people in their lifetimes generation after generation  did not have the transport to move away  unless they were driven to do it on foot  by force or famine 

What I want to claim is  that communication now extends far beyond language  because of technologies which have matured from infancy during the twentieth century 

Those of radio and television are no respecters of national boundaries  though political regimes have histories of trying to jam them 

Television being visual largely circumvents language as a means of reporting 

It is ironic that the power of the technological media to penetrate  has been enhanced by the ballistics of rocketry  the development which  uh was accelerated first by Hitler 's concern to acquire the V Two weapon  and then by the political rivalry to be first on the moon 

The important point is  that the technology  has arrived 

At the same time  aviation reached the stage at which it became the instrument of military force 

This seemed to establish its importance in national politics 

It then moved on to demonstrate that force has only a negative return 

And aviation had a second child  in the form of mass international tourism  which as a form of communication  owes very little to national politics  but it has enhanced the world 's social life perhaps more than anything else 

So technology has breached barriers of geography and also with some resistance those of national politics 

It is also pitched directly against barriers of language 

Electronic aids to learning languages help to overcome these barriers and the apparatus of simultaneous translation helps to set them aside 

But  people who can converse in languages other than their own  as I can not  advance the cause of civilisation 

Technology is not the only force at work  uh towards wider understanding 

Political history has created a current too  rather inadvertently 

Britain 's commercial naval and colonial past  has made the English language the prevailing first language in the official and international commercial circles  of the fifty countries of the Commonwealth  which include one thousand four hundred million people or more than one in four of the world 's population 

That same history planted English geographically  so that it became the founding and bonding language of the United States  though the occasion was the defeat of British colonial power 

English has held its place in the U S A  in spite of the enormous range of ancestral ethnic origins  and their changing proportions among her people 

The significance of this fact is vastly magnified  by the importance which the United States economy assumed  as a massive force in the world 's commerce  and in international aid 

Consequently as Japan and other strongly commercial states in the Pacific basin  have become major players  and expect to become greater ones still  in international trade  they have taken pains to be proficient in English as their second language if not their first one 

The People 's Republic of China has been pursuing the same end for years  not without some valued help from this house 

Another and perhaps conclusive feature of the twentieth century  is that for air traffic control a single language has become more and more obviously necessary

The language n which now predominates in the air is English 

Now nothing that I 've said implies any sort of cultural judgement between languages any more than Latin as the lingua franca of learning in Europe  in the Middle Ages would be judged superior to Greek as a vehicle of culture 

The Eu European Community  sets an excellent example  by its proper cultural respect for the separate languages of its member states

But that respect is due to the whole literary tradition of mankind  in the ancient and modern civilisations of the west  to say nothing of the Middle East  or of the Far East 

Literature in all its forms is one thing

Convenience of communication and commerce is another 

Both have their place 

My point is that language of convenient communication which used to be the hallmark of nations has become the property of the whole world 

To reverse the technological achievements of the twentieth century in communications or in aviation  and to lose access to the sciences on which they are founded  would entail such cataclysm  that it can have no part in the probabilities of prediction 

Political forces could release nuclear annihilation  which could be sufficiently cataclysmic 

But predictions wouldn't then matter  so there 's no point in not carrying the achievements of science and technology forward as realistic components in the future

They carry their own primacy over political forces in any form with which we 're familiar 

Galileo proved to be right 

and the princes of the day to be wrong 

Well I suppose that by daring to attempt uh to look into the future  I lay myself open to a demand to produce some projections about the size of the world 's population and alongside that the volume of s life-sustaining resources that may be deployed in the world 

Well you all know that Malthus said two hundred years ago 

population when unchecked increases in a geometrical ratio 

Subsistence only increases in an arithmetical ratio 

Well there 's a hideous ring of truth about that statement  when we think of it in terms of localities  where we have seen populations rising and famine occurring

But we have also seen different things happening in different parts of the world 

Within the last twenty years the People 's Republic of China  became so fearful of the population outstripping the means of subsistence within her frontiers  that Peking if I can still call it like that  decreed restraint of parenthood  under penalty  to one child for each couple 

But society in China has to reckon also  with a golden tradition of the young generation caring for the old in the family circle  and with a black tradition of female infanticide 

The matter will not end with a decree 

In India Pakistan and Bangladesh there 's a huge population subsisting within a democratic tradition in general support of education directed both to establishing birth control and also to reducing infant mortality 

There are just a lot of people to teach 

In south-east Asia and in South America there 's less of a tradition of democracy less articulation of the consequences of the birth rate among the very poor but there 's also less evident inadequacy of natural resources 

In Soviet Russia the prospect is of the population of White Russia growing no more while the Islamic population of the southern republics continues to grow 

Shortages of food have been a repeated feature of recent Soviet experience  with heavy dependence on grain imported from the United States as the Soviets ' own production has failed 

But the spotlight has been on empty shops in the towns rather than empty larders in the countryside 

It is to Africa that the television cameras go to show what happens when local natural resources are so inadequate for the population living off them that drought or continuous small-arms war causes famine for the people counted in millions and death for many of them 

Apart from such disasters in succession in the same or in different places infant mortality is the main counter to the birth rate 's effect in Africa 

and in parts of the continent the heterosexual incidence of Aids may prove to have halted or even reversed the growth in the population of potential parents and condemned large numbers of children to early death 

I infer from this all too swift outline of the world 's population at the threshold of the twenty-first century not that it is proved that there 's not enough nutriment to go round but that it is clear that there 's not enough of taking it round 

Yet we collect ours from all over the world and know how it can be stored 

I wonder whether anything has proved more effective in reducing the birth rate than a rising standard of living 

Perhaps we need another Malthus  uh to uh deliver  a new message 

The best way I can think of to illustrate realistically the roots of the problem of insufficiency without creating such a din of controversy is to take authoritative estimates far enough in the past for people who are in authority now not to feel impugned  but near enough to the 

I was led to Robert McNamara as my authority by Susan George 's memorable book How the Other Half Die  which she published in nineteen seventy-six

but the prime cause of my desire to know about this was the work of my late brother Kenneth  who spent and lost his life trying to raise the livelihoods of African populations above subsistence 

He learned and taught that where there is no livelihood to be earned except from the land  it is better use of local agricultural conditions and only that can lay the foundations of better life 

In India in the late nineteen seventies less than twenty-five per cent of institutional credit was available in rural areas 

In Bangladesh it was less than ten per cent 

In terms of credit in any form state or private  only the top fifteen per cent of the farming community in Brazil had access to it 

In Africa only five per cent 

How can investment in the needs of the land for cultivation no more than that be expected when so few have access to credit and there are a hundred million small farmers who have no access at all 

Poor land poor harvest 

Drought no harvest 

When the harvest has been consumed have been exhausted the farmer lacking recourse to institutional credit  can only turn to the local usurer

I think I 've set myself a very difficult if not impossible task in trying to talk about prosodic analysis  and its place in linguistics in just forty-five minutes 

Two reasons

First of all because  what is subsumed under prosodic analysis doesn't really  constitute a single totally self-consistent theory 

It 's rather a set of proposals made by a number of different scholars 

And secondly I obviously can't do justice in sus in such a short time  to the exposition of the ways in which this theory differed from other views at the time 

Prosodic analysis had its origins in a number of articles written by J R Firth in the nineteen-thirties 

But almost all of the relevant papers were produced by Firth and members of the staff and students from the Department of Phonetics and Linguistics  who became later known as the London School  between nineteen forty-eight and nineteen and the middle nineteen-sixties 

Firth 's early works uh were collected and published by him in Papers In Linguistics

I have listed in fact all relevant things as you 'll see on the sheet 

Uhm if you haven't got one you should have collected one from the uhm  table over there 

They were collected in Papers In Linguistics nineteen thirty fou one four to nineteen fifty-one which Firth himself edited 

And a collection of his later works found in Selected Papers in  nineteen fifty-two fifty-nine  but none of these articles in that volume dealt specifically with prosodic theory 

He was n already  turning his attention to other interests

But a collection of sixteen papers on prosodic analysis  all of which had been published previously  between nineteen forty-eight and nineteen sixty-one  together with a bibliography of ninety items is to be found in Prosodic Analysis nineteen seventy of which I was the editor 

Most of the peop papers had already appeared in journals especially the  of the school 

but a set of original papers was also published under the title of Studies In Linguistic Analysis  in nineteen fifty-seven 

For an excellent contemporary account of the theory I would advise you to look at Robins ' Aspects Of Prosodic Analysis nineteen fifty-seven 

It is generally known that the most imp obvious point about prosodic analysis was its complete rejection of most of the beliefs or dogmas of the American Structuralist version of the phoneme theory  which had its origins in the work of Bloomfield but had been developed and made rigorous  that was a favourite term of the age  by scholars such as Bloch  Hockett  Harris and Pike 

The most important articles written by these so-called post-Bloomfieldians were with the exception of the works of Pike  for reasons that I shall explain later  republished in Readings In Linguistics  edited by Martin Jones in nineteen fifty-eight 

But it 's important to realise and to remember that Firth also worked during the nineteen thirties  in the Department of Phonetics at University College London  then headed by Daniel Jones  who was as equally committed to the phoneme  as were his American contemporaries 

Jones 's work was often quoted in American works in the early nineteen thirties it 's quoted for instance or in the nineteen thirties

in fact it 's quoted for instance in the article by name which I mention down here and on the uniqueness of phonemic solutions  and also  by uhm  by Twaddell  uh On Defining The Phoneme 

But it was almost completely ignored  in the so-called rigorous publications of the nineteen forties 

Undoubtedly there are two aspects of prosodic analysis  that clearly distinguish it from the American-style phonemics 

For in phonemics  speech could and must be segmented into discrete segments  linearly arranged in sequence 

These were the phonemes  and it was held that there was a single l limited inventory of such elements  all with the same theoretical status  and that the phonological description of a text  was entirely stateable in terms of the distribution of such phonemes 

By contrast the emphasis in prosodic analysis  was on non-segmental features which were not aligned not arranged in linear sequence  and on the view that there was not a single inventory of phonological units  but a number of different systems that might or might not have shared members or terms 

In this sense the approach was said to be both non-segmental and polysystemic  in contrast with the segmental and monosystemic phonemics 

Prosodic analysis was I suppose born  with the publication of uh Sounds And Prosodies in nineteen forty eight 

though of equal if not perhaps of greater importance for the development of the theory was Henderson 's Prosodies in Siamese  nineteen forty nine  which was published by as you see in the following year 

While Firth 's work is programmatic and discursive  and it 's often difficult to understand precisely what he intended  Henderson 's article  showed how the theory could be applied and can perhaps be seen as a classic exposition of it 

In fact however  although in the spirit of Sounds And Prosodies it took the theory in a direction that Firth may not perhaps fully have expected  and it provided the model for most of the later works 

In Sounds And Prosodies  Firth aims to distinguish prosodic systems from what he calls phonematic systems  taking as he says words as his I quote principal isolates 

He avoids the word phoneme preferring sound and this explains the title of the article 

Using the familiar symbols of C and V for consonant and vowel  he is first able  to extract to establish the syn syntagmatic syllabic structures of words  and then to abstract the features which he says mark  word and syllable initials  word and syllable finals or word functions  and to regard these  syntagmatically as prosodies  distinct from the phonematic constituents which are units of the consonant and vowel systems 

It was entirely  in that paper 

No I 'm sorry in a later paper 

He later talks about the syllabic structure 

I beg your pardon in that paper 

He later talks about syllabic structure with properties such as initial final and medial characteristics the number and nature of the syllables quantity stress and tone 

The distinction seems to me clear and distinction uh clear and simple 

The features that can be stated in terms of syllabic or word structure are prosodic 

These features are abstracted  and what remains makes up a paradigmatic uhm vowel and consonant systems  the terms of which are the phonematic units 

It would appear from what he says that he recognises three different types of prosody  first the world the word and syllab syllabic structure itself  secondly the features of quantity stress and tone  which are of course prosodic in the traditional sense  and thirdly the features to be abstracted as characteristics of syllable and word final medial and and initial 

It was with this last type that much of the later prosodic analysis was concerned  especially with what were called the W and Y prosodies  but also with features such as nasalization openness etc 

Firth provided some examples  but he was in fact apparently more interested at the time in matters of syllabic structure than with this last type 

Indeed in discussing  c parallel colloquial Arabic he had eight prosodies  of which only one  and that is what he called the clear or dark  on the syllable is of this  third kind 

Similarly an analysis of a stretch of English marks as prosodies stress and intonation  analysis into schwa  with V and C and what he calls junctions  that link some words phonologically 

Henderson 's Prosod Prosodies in Siamese  unlike Sounds and Prosodies is largely descriptive  and introduces  many of the features that were seen  later to be typical prosodies 

Its aim is to present a prosodic analysis in terms of a hierarchy  beginning with a sentence  and working downwards  to the vowels and to the consonants 

There are therefore  from the top downwards in the hierarchy  prosodies of the sentence  prosodies of sentence parts  prosodies of polysyllables  prosodies of syllables and prosodies of syllable parts 

And finally there are the paradigmatic consonantal and vocalic phonematic units 

The work begins with monosyllables with a description of the gma of the prosodies of syllable beginning  the prosodies of syllable ending  and the prosodies of the syllable as a whole 

This is the most striking exemplification  of what was to become the main thrust of the theory 

In phonemic terms  Siamese has an inventory of twenty consonants in initial position  but only seven in final position 

But the initial and final consonants  differ greatly in terms of their phonetic features 

These differences  made it possible to abstract all the features associated with initial position only  features of plosion  aspiration  voice  except the nos nasality  affrication friction lateralisation rhoticisation and labialisation 

And these were the prosodies of syllable beginning 

But once all these features were abstracted  the number of consonantal contrasts  including those of consonant consonant clusters is greatly reduced 

No longer was it necessary to recognise twenty different consonants  and eleven consonant clusters initially 

Instead there is a system of only six  which Henderson symbolized as k p t uhm eng long-tailed n m n and zero 

Thus what were phonemically t  t h and d  are an all analysed as t with initial prosodies  of plosion plosion with aspiration plosion with voice respectively 

And there 's an anal similar analysis  for all the other consonants

for instance k h r  is k with the prosodies of plosion aspiration and rhoticisation 

The importance of the analysis of syllable parts as a model for later scholars  must not disguise the fact that analysis in terms of a hierarchy  that applies prosodic analysis to all the constituents of a sentence  is a proper aim for a theory 

and Henderson 's articles  Henderson 's article was by far the most successful in this respect 

I think perhaps it may however be said  that the case  it may be said perhaps that the overall neatness and completeness of her analysis  was possible only for a language such as Siamese 

Although nineteen forty eight and nineteen forty nine are such important dates for prosodic analysis  the origins of it are to be found in Firth 's works during the nineteen thirties 

In for instance Phonological Features Of Some Indian Languages nineteen thirty five  he discusses voice aspiration and length  and says that nasals and nasalization I quote raise fundamental problems for phonetic and phonological theory 

He also talks about systematic relations between the letters of an alternance  and he recognises a two term alternance of nasal initially  with a three term alternance finally 

Here we find  the first signs of his interest in non-segmental features  and in the notion of multiple systems 

There are similar ideas in other works notably in the Technique Of Semantics  nineteen thirty five  which was regarded as his major prewar prewar work 

but it is in The Structure Of The Chinese Monosyllable In A Hunanese Dialect  nineteen thirty seven that he argues explicitly for distinct places in the syllable 

and he rejects the notion that the vowel alternations in a syllable with final nasals should be identified with vowels in other contexts 

And he further says  the yoticisation and labialisation differences may be regarded as syllabic diacritical diacritica  and not as being placed 

Placed he put in quotes again put in quotes himself 

Yoticisation and la labial velarisation  are of course  what were to become the familiar Y and W prosodies 

The term prosodic unit the term prosodic is used here  but only to refer to features such as tone 

But he thinks it with these other features when he says  the prosodic diacritica  and to a certain extent what we have termed yoticisation yotisation and labial velari velarisation  are characteristics of the syllable as a whole 

It 's interesting to note that some years later  he presented a copy of that article  to Eugenie Henderson and wrote on it

and I quote 

this was the first quote non-phonemic end of quote article published in English  and the first to separate the again quoted  in quotes by him successive or quotes by him placed  units from those which are not placed  and may be regarded as non-successive 

People have passed it by in English in England  because the principles were lost in the detail  but quite a new theory is here implied 

There is also a comment in the margin of the page where he discusses initial consonants in terms of consonantal types  aspiration tensity voice difference etc  and the differentiation of the syllable in terms of yoticisation and libo labial velarisation 

It 's been suggested  even indeed by some of my right honourable friends  that I decided to resign  solely because of questions of style  and not on matters of substance at all 

Indeed if some of my former colleagues are to be believed I must be the first minister in history to have resigned because he was in full agreement with government policy 

The truth the truth is Mr Speaker  that in many aspects of politics  style and substance  complement each other 

Very often they 're two sides of the same coin 

Mr Speaker the Prime Minister and I  have shared together  something like seven hundred meetings  of cabinet or shadow cabinet  over the last eighteen years 

Some some four hundred hours alongside each other  at more than thirty international summit meetings 

For both of us I suspect that 's a pretty daunting record 

The House might well feel that something more than simple matters of style  will be necessary to rupture such a well-tried relationship 

It was indeed a privilege to serve as my right honourable friend 's first Chancellor of the Exchequer  to share in the transformation of our industrial relations scene  to help launch our free market programme commencing with the abolition of exchange control  and above all  to achieve such substantial success against inflation  getting it down within four years from twenty-two to four per cent  upon the basis of the strict monetary discipline involved in the medium term financial strategy 

Not one of our economic achievements would have been possible  without the courage and the leadership of my right honourable friend 

And if I may say so Mr Speaker  they possibly derived some little benefit  from the presence of a Chancellor  who wasn't exactly a wet himself 

It was too a great honour  to serve for six years as Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary  and to share with my right honourable friend  in some in some notable achievements  in the European Community  from Fontainebleau to the Single European Act 

But it was as we moved on to consider the crucial monetary issues  in the European context  that I 've come to feel increasing concern 

Some of the reasons for this anxiety  were made very clear  by my right honourable friend the member for Blaby  in his resignation speech just over twelve months ago 

For like him I concluded at least five years back  that the conduct of our policy against inflation  could no longer rest solely  on attempts to measure and control the domestic money supply 

We had no doubt  that we should be helped in that battle and indeed in other respects  by joining the exchange rate mechanism  of the European monetary system 

There was or should have been nothing novel about joining the E R M 

It 's been a long-standing commitment  and we 'd found for a quarter of a century after the Second World War  that the very similar Bretton Woods regime  did serve as a useful discipline  and now as my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has acknowledged two weeks ago  our entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism can indeed be seen  as an extra discipline for keeping down inflation 

But it must be said  that this important practical conclusion  has only been achieved  at the cost of substantial damage  to her own administration  and more serious still  to its inflation achievement 

For as my right honourable friend the member for Blaby has explained  the real tragedy is  that we did not join the Exchange Rate Mechanism at least five years ago

That was as he also made clear  not for want of trying 

Indeed the so-called Madrid Conditions came into existence  only after the then Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself as Foreign Secretary  made it clear that we could not continue in office  unless a specific commitment to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism was made 

As the House will no doubt have observed  neither member of that particular partnership now remains in office 

Our successor as Chancellor of the Exchequer  has during the last year  had to devote a good deal of his considerable talent  to demonstrating exactly how those Madrid conditions have been attained   so as to make it  so as to make it possible to fulfil to fulfil a commitment  whose achievement has long been in the national interest 

It is now alas  impossible to resist the conclusion  that today 's higher rates of inflation  could well have been avoided  had the question of E R M membership  been properly considered and resolved  at a much earlier stage 

There are I fear developing grounds for similar anxieties  over the handling not just at and after the Rome summit  of the wider much more open question of economic and monetary union 

Let me first make clear  certain important points on which I have  no disagreement  with my right honourable friend 

I do not regard the Delors Report as some kind of sacred text  that has to be accepted or even rejected on the nod  but it is an important working document 

As I 've often made plain  it is seriously deficient in significant respects 

I do not regard the Italian presidency 's management  of the Rome Summit as a model of its kind   Far

far from it 

It was much the same as my right honourable friend the Prime Minister will recall in Milan some five years befo five years ago 

I do not regard it  as in any sense wrong for Britain to make criticisms of that kind  plainly and courteously  nor in any sense wrong  for us to do so if necessary alone 

As I 've already made clear  I have like the Prime Minister and other right honourable friends  fought too many European battles in a minority of one to have any illusions on that score 

But it is crucially important  that we should conduct those arguments  upon the basis of a clear understanding  of the true relationship between this country  the Community  and our Community partners 

And it is here I fear  that my right honourable friend  increasingly risks leading herself and others astray  in matters of substance  as well as of style 

It was the late Lord Stockton formerly Harold Macmillan  who first put the central point clearly 

As long ago as nineteen sixty-two  he argued that we had to place and keep ourselves  within the European Community 

He saw it as essential then as it is today  not to cut ourselves off  from the realities of power  not to retreat  into a ghetto of sentimentality about our past  and so diminish our own control over our own destiny in the future 

The pity is  that the Macmillan view  had not been perceived more clearly a decade before in the nineteen fifties 

It would have spared us so many of the struggles of the last twenty years  had we been in the Community from the outset  had we been ready  in the much too simple phrase  to surrender some sovereignty  at a much earlier stage 

If we had been in from the start  as almost everybody now acknowledges  we should have had more not less influence  over the Europe in which we live today 

We should never forget the lesson of that isolation  of being on the outside looking in  for the conduct of today 's affairs 

We have done best  when we 've seen the Community not as a static entity to be resisted and contained  but as an active process which we can shape often decisively  provided we allow ourselves to be fully engaged in it  with confidence with enthusiasm  and in good faith 

We must at all costs  avoid presenting ourselves yet again  with an over-simplified choice  a false antithesis  a bogus dilemma  between one alternative  starkly labelled  cooperation between independent sovereign states and a second equally crudely labelled alternative  centralised federal superstate  as if there were no middle way in between 

We commit a serious error  if we think always in terms of surrendering sovereignty  and seek to stand pat for all time on a given deal  by proclaiming as my right honourable friend the Prime Minister did two weeks ago  that we have surrendered enough 

The European enterprise  is not and should not be seen like that as some kind of  zero sum gain 

Sir Winston Churchi Churchill put it much more positively  forty years ago when he said 

is it not possible  and not less agreeable  to regard this sacrifice or merger of national sovereignty  as the gradual assumption by all nations concerned  of that larger sovereignty  which can alone protect their diverse and distinctive customs and characteristics of their national traditions 

I have to say Mr Speaker that I find Winston Churchill 's perception  a good deal more convincing  and more encouraging for the interests of our nation  than the nightmare image sometimes conjured up by my right honourable friend  who seems who seems sometimes to look out  upon a Continent  that is positively teeming with ill-intentioned people  scheming in her words to extinguish democracy  to dissolve our national identities  to lead us through the back door into a federal Europe 

What kind of vision is that Mr Speaker  for our business people who trade there each day  for our financiers who seek to make London the money capital of Europe or for all the young people of today 

These concerns are especially important  as we approach the crucial topic  of economic and monetary union 

We must be positively  and centrally involved in this debate and not fearfully and negatively detached 

The costs of disengagement here  could be very serious indeed 

There 's talk of course of the emergence of a single currency for Europe 

I agree that there are many difficulties about the concept both economic and political 

And of course as I said in my own letter of resignation  none of us wants the imposition of a single currency 

But that isn't the real risk 

The eleven others  do not impose their solution on the twelfth country against its will 

But they can go ahead without it 

The risk is not imposition  but isolation 

The real threat  is of leaving ourselves with no say  in the monetary arrangements  that the rest of Europe chooses for itself  with Britain once again scrambling to join the club later  after the rules have been set  and after the power has been distributed by others to our disadvantage 

That would be the worst possible outcome 

It is to avoid just that outcome  to find a compromise both acceptable in the Government  and sellable in Europe  that my right honourable friend the Chancellor  has put forward his hard ecu proposal 

This lays careful emphasis on the possibility  that the hard ecu as a common currency  could given time evolve  into a single currency 

I have of course supported the hard ecu plan  but after Rome  and after my right honourable friend 's comments two weeks ago  there is grave danger that the hard ecu is becoming untenable 

For two things have happened 

The first was that my right honourable friend has appeared  to rule out from the start  any compromise at any stage on any of the basic components which all the eleven other countries believe to be a part of E M U  a single currency or a permanently fixed exchange rate  central bank  or common monetary policy 

Asked if we would veto any arrangement which jeopardised the pound sterling  my right honourable friend replied simply yes 

That statement means not that we can block E M U  but that they can go ahead without us 

Is that a position that is likely to ensure  as I put it in my resignation letter  that we hold and retain a position of influence in this vital debate 

I fear not 

Rather to do so we must as I said  take care  not to rule in  or rule out any one solution absolutely 

We must be seen to be part  of the same negotiation 

The second thing that 's happened is I fear  even more disturbing 

Reporting to this House my right honourable friend  almost casually remarked  that she didn't think many people would want to use the hard ecu anyway  even as a common currency  let alone as a single one 

It was remarkable  indeed it was tragic  to hear my right honourable friend dismissing  with such personalised incredulity  the very idea  that the hard ecu proposal  might find growing favour among the peoples of Europe  just as it was extraordinary to hear her assert  that the whole idea of E M U  might be open for consideration  only by future generations 

Mr Speaker  those future generations are with us today 

How on earth  are the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England  commending the hard ecu as they strive to do  to be taken as serious participants in the debate  against that kind of background noise 

Mr Speaker   Mr Speaker I believe that first the Chancellor and the Governor  are cricketing enthusiasts  so I hope there 's no monopoly of cricketing metaphors 

It 's rather like sending your opening batsmen to the crease  only for them to find  the moment the first balls are bowled that their bats had been broken before the game by the team captain 

The point  the point Mr Speaker  is perhaps more sharply put by a British businessman  trading in Brussels and elsewhere who wrote to me last week 









And sadly Mr Speaker  I have to agree 

The tragedy is  and it is for me personally  for my party  for our whole people  and for my right honourable friend herself a very real tragedy 

The Prime Minister 's perceived attitude towards Europe  is running increasingly serious risks  for the future of our nation 

It risks minimising our influence  and maximising our chances of being once again shut out 

We paid heavily in the past for late starts and squandered opportunities in Europe 

We dare not let that happen again 

If we detach ourselves completely  as a party or as a nation  from the middle ground of Europe  the effects will be incalculable  and very hard ever to correct
